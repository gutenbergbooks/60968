<h2>PUBLISHERS&#8217; NOTE TO THE ENGLISH
EDITION</h2>

<p class="noindent">The author&#8217;s aim in writing this book was to write a complete
Encyclop&aelig;dia on the sexual sciences, and it will probably be
acknowledged by all who study its pages that the author has
accomplished his intention in a very scholarly manner, and in such
form as to be of great value to the professions for whom this
translation is intended. The subject is no doubt one which
appeals to and affects the interests of all adult persons, but the
publishers have, after very serious and careful consideration,
come to the conclusion that the sale of the English translation
of the book shall be <b>limited to members of the legal and medical
professions</b>. To both these professions it is essential that a
knowledge of the science of Sex and the various causes for the
existence of &#8220;abnormals&#8221; should be ascertained, so that they
may be guided in the future in their investigations into, and the
practice of attempts to mitigate, the evil which undoubtedly
exists, and to bring about a more healthy class of beings. It is
the first time that the subject has been so carefully and fully gone
into in the English language, and it is believed that the very
exhaustive examination which the author has made into the
matter, and the various cases to which he has called attention,
will be of considerable use to the medical practitioner, and also
to the lawyer in criminal and quasi-criminal matters, and probably
in matrimonial disputes and cases of insanity.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="noindent">The sexuality of the modern civilized man&mdash;the sum, that is to
say, of the phenomena of sexual love dependent upon and
associated with the sexual impulse&mdash;is the result of a process of
development lasting many thousands of years. Therein, as in a
mirror, we may see an accurate reflection of all the phases of the
bodily and mental history of the human race. Anyone who
wishes to understand modern love in all its complexity must, in
the first place, succeed in informing himself, not merely regarding
the first foundations of the feeling of love in the grey primeval
age, but, in addition, as to the manner in which that feeling has
been transformed and enriched in the course of the history of
civilization. For modern love is a complex of two constituents.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;love&#8221; is applicable to the sexual impulse of human
beings only. Its use implies that in the case of man the purely
animal feelings have acquired an <b>importance</b> far greater than that
of subserving the purposes of mere reproduction, and aim at a
<b>goal</b> transcending that of the preservation of the species. The
nature of human love can be understood and explained only with
reference to this intimate and inseparable union of its purposes in
respect of the preservation of the species and its independent
significance in the life of the loving individual himself. Herein is
to be found the starting-point of the whole so-called &#8220;sexual
problem,&#8221; and it is necessary that the matter should be clearly
understood at the outset of this book. In earlier days human
love was mainly concerned with the purposes of the species.
Modern civilized man, conceiving history as progress in the
consciousness of freedom, has also come to recognize the profound
<b>individual</b> significance of love for his own inward growth, for the
proper development of his free manhood. To quote a phrase
from Georg Hirth, a cultured modern writer, the genuine experienced
love of a civilized man of the present day is one of the
&#8220;ways to freedom.&#8221; By love is made manifest, and through
love is developed, his inmost individual nature. For this reason
Schopenhauer&#8217;s &#8220;Metaphysik der Geschlechtsliebe&#8221; (&#8220;Metaphysic
of Sexual Love&#8221;), which wholly ignores this individual factor,
must be regarded, brilliant as it unquestionably is, as a quite
inadequate explanation of the nature of love. Again, a recent
writer, Arnold Lindwurm, greatly influenced by Schopenhauer&#8217;s
teaching, in the introduction to his work entitled &#8220;Ueber die<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
Geschlechtsliebe in sozial-ethische Beziehung&#8221; (&#8220;Sexual Love in
its Socio-Ethical Relations&#8221;), writes: &#8220;The <b>fruit of love</b>, <b>children</b>,
and <b>marriage</b> as a domestic institution indispensable for the
upbringing of children&mdash;these constitute the author&#8217;s ethical
criterion in the field of sexual research; these also form the socio-ethical
goal of all sexual love, inasmuch as the <b>sole</b> standard by
which sexual love can be judged is the procreation and upbringing
of children.&#8221; We, however, at the very outset, contest the
validity of such a standpoint, for we consider that it fails entirely
to do justice to the nature of modern love. For the history of the
human sexual impulse teaches us beyond dispute that, in the
course of the development of the human species, that impulse,
through its progressive association with intellectual and emotional
elements to form the complex whole designated by the term
&#8220;love,&#8221; has undergone a progressive individualization, and has
attained a more defined significance for the unitary human being.
At the present day sexual love constitutes a part of the very being
of the civilized man; his sexual life clearly reflects his individual
nature, and love influences his development in an enduring
manner.</p>

<p>Love conjoins in a quite unique way the <b>two</b> principal classes of
vital manifestations&mdash;the lower vegetative and the higher
animal life; and it thus constitutes the highest and the most
intense expression of the <b>unity</b> of life (Schopenhauer&#8217;s &#8220;focus of
the will;&#8221; Weismann&#8217;s &#8220;continuity of the germ-plasma&#8221;).</p>

<p>Whoever wishes to understand the developmental tendencies of
love as they manifest themselves at the present day in the course
of human history, whoever desires to grasp how remarkably love
has been developed, enriched, and ennobled in the course of
civilization, must at the outset gain a clear understanding of this
apparently dualistic, but in reality thoroughly monistic, nature
of the passion.</p>

<p>The matter may be expressed also in this way&mdash;that he who has
scientifically investigated love, who has based his conception of
it philosophically, and has personally experienced it, will become
a convinced monist in relation to life, at least, and to the organic
world, and will be compelled to regard every dualistic division
into a physical and a spiritual sphere as something quite artificial.
In love above all is manifested this mystery of the life force, as
for centuries the poets, the artists, and the metaphysicians have
declared, and more especially as the great natural philosophers of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have proved&mdash;above all
Charles Darwin and Ernst Haeckel. There is, indeed, no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
happily chosen metaphor, none that better describes the fundamentally
monistic nature of love, than the saying of the old
&aelig;sthetic J. G. Sulzer&mdash;that love is a <b>tree</b>, that it has its <b>roots</b> in
the physical sphere, but that its <b>branches</b> extend high above the
physical world, expanding more and more, branching more and
more abundantly into the sphere of the
<span class="nowrap">spiritual.<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> It is certainly
impossible to find a more appropriate comparison. Thereby we
show clearly the intimate <b>organic</b> connexion between the physical
and spiritual phenomena of love; it is rooted for ever in Mother
Earth, but it grows always upwards into the subtle ether. Just
as the arborescence of the tree has a richer, more manifold, more
extensive development than the root, so also it is in the <b>spiritual</b>
form that love is first capable of extending upwards and in all
directions, compared with which its physical capacity for development
is minimal and strictly limited. <b>But just as the arborescence
of the tree grows from, and is supplied with nutriment by, the root,
so also the higher love is inevitably founded upon a sensory basis.
Even while</b> love becomes spiritually richer, it remains as irrevocably
as ever dependent upon the <span class="nowrap">physical.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>To put the matter briefly, the future <b>developmental possibilities</b>
of human love rest purely in the spiritual sphere, but they
are inseparably connected with the far less variable physical
phenomena of sexuality.</p>

<p>Upon the development, the configuration, and the differentiation,
of the spiritual elements of sexual love are alone based the
intimate relations of love with the process of civilization. This
fact is again reflected in the manifold phases of the evolution of
the sentiment of love.</p>

<p>For the human spirit in the course of its development has
become not merely lord of the earth and of the elementary forces
of Nature: it has become also lord and master, interpreter and
guide, of the sexual impulse; for this impulse owes to the human
spirit its new and peculiar life, its life <b>capable of further development</b>
as manifested in the history of human love. The history of
love is the history of mankind, of civilization. For love manifests
a continual <b>progress</b>, which can be denied by those only who have
failed to understand the deep significance of human love in the
entire civilized life of all times, and who, observing the persistence<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
of the primeval and ever-active sexual impulse, elemental in its
nature, are led only to a hopeless doubt as to the possibility of all
love, and thus justify the pessimism with which Schopenhauer
has condemned the significance of human sexual love. Undoubtedly
this elemental impulse persists for ever, and to follow
it <b>alone</b> leads to death, to utter desolation, to nothingness, as
Tolstoi, Strindberg, and Weininger, the bitter opponents of
modern &#8220;love,&#8221; have so vehemently declared. But did these
men know true love? Had they become conscious of the
inevitable <b>necessity</b> with which civilization in the course of ages
and generations had transformed the human sexual impulse into
love as it now exists, transformed it in so manifold and so wonderful
a way? Had they any idea of the <b>development</b> of love, and of
its place and its significance in history?</p>

<p>Let them believe this, these doubting and despairing souls&mdash;<b>nothing</b>
has been destroyed of all the spiritual relations, of all the
wonderful possibilities of development, which have manifested
themselves in the course of the long and varied history of the
evolution of love. To describe this evolution, it is necessary to
draw attention to all those elements of civilization which <b>remain
at present</b> influential in love, but it is further indispensable to
forecast their future development. Once again we stand at an
important turning-point in the history of love. The old separates
itself from the new, the better will once more be the enemy of
the good. But love regarded, as it must now be regarded, in its
inner <b>nature</b>, as a sexual impulse most perfectly and completely
infused with a spiritual content, will remain the inalienable gain
of civilization; it will stand forth ever purer and more promotive
of happiness, like a mirror of marvellous clearness, wherein is
reflected a peculiar and accurate picture of the successive epochs
of civilization.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="noindent">The mystery of sexual love, of this &#8220;wonder of life,&#8221; from which
both religious belief and artistic inspiration have drawn and
continue to draw the major part of their force, may ultimately
be referred to a single phenomenon in the sexuality of the great
group of metazoa to which the major part of the animal world
and the human species belong. This process is a conjugation
of the female germ cell with the male sperm cell&mdash;the &#8220;well-spring
of love,&#8221; to use Haeckel&#8217;s expression; in comparison with
this conjugation, all other spiritual and physical phenomena,
however complicated, are of a subordinate and secondary nature.
From this primitive organic process of reciprocal attraction and
conjugation of the two reproductive cells has arisen the entire
complex of the remaining physical and spiritual phenomena of
love. We have, in this process of cell conjugation, a picture in
little of love, a greatly simplified representation of the nature of the
relations between man and woman; moreover, the highest and the
finest psychical experiences and impressions occurring under the
influence of love are ultimately no more than the results of this
&#8220;erotic chemotropism&#8221; of the sperm and germ cells.</p>

<p>Sexual <b>differentiation</b> existed already as a <b>natural</b> product in the
early stages of organic evolution, and <b>civilization</b> has done no
more than develop, increase, and refine that differentiation,
which is typified in a manner at once simple and convincing&mdash;because
<b>directly visible</b>&mdash;in the male sperm cell and the female
germ cell. Herein the <b>specific sexual differences</b> are made visibly
manifest.</p>

<p>Procreation results from the approach of the male sperm cell
towards the female germ cell, and from the entrance of the former
into the latter.</p>

<p>Thus, the sperm cell represents the <b>active</b>, the germ cell the
<b>passive</b>, principle in sexuality. Already in this <b>most important</b>
act in the process of procreation the natural relations between
man and woman are very clearly manifested. This fact is clearly
grasped already in the mythology and the sepulchral symbolism
of antiquity. In these the man is always represented as the active
principle; woman, on the contrary, as the passive principle.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Peace reigns in the ovum, but when driven by the desire of creation
the masculine god breaks through the shell and begins his work of
fertilization, everything at once becomes movement, restless haste,<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
impulsive force, unending circulation. Thus the male generative
principle appears as the representative and embodiment of movement
in the visible act of creation.... The active principle in Nature
appears to be identical with the principle of motion.... Winged
is the phallus, quiescent the female; the man is the principle of movement,
and the woman the principle of repose; force is the cause of
eternal change, woman the picture of eternal repose; for which reason
the &#8216;earth-mother&#8217; is almost always depicted in a sitting posture&#8221;
(Bachofen).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The appearance of <b>sexual</b> reproduction in the history of the
evolution of the organic world is an especially instructive example
of the great importance of differentiation and variation as the
most effective principle of evolution in general. The lowliest
forms of life reproduce their kind in an extremely simple manner
by a process of asexual cell division, which has not improperly
been regarded as nothing more than a peculiar form of <b>growth</b>;
and this simple process of cell division is retained as a mode of
growth also in the higher organisms which reproduce their kind
by sexual union. In some cases of simple cell division the secondary
cell, the &#8220;daughter cell,&#8221; separates itself from the old cell,
the &#8220;mother cell,&#8221; and forms a new complete individual; in
other cases the cell division occurs as gemmiparous reproduction
(budding or pululation), the daughter cell remaining united with
the mother cell, so that a new organ is built up. Reproduction
by cell division is found in many plants and lower animals side by
side with sexual reproduction. This latter becomes the exclusive
method of production in higher animals and in the human species,
whose capacity for the procreation of new individuals by cell
division, and for the replacement of lost organs by growth, has
been lost. Thus, the progress and the gain which on the one
hand are derived from the process of sexual reproduction, whose
character we are about to investigate more closely, are balanced
on the other hand by a loss. We shall often encounter this fact
again in the history of the evolution of the sexual impulse, more
especially in mankind and in relation to human love.</p>

<p>With the evolution of sexual reproduction is introduced the
opportunity for a great step forward, since an incomparably
greater sphere of action is opened to the differentiation and variability
of specific forms than was possible in the case of species
reproduced asexually (Kerner von Marilaun, R. Martin). By
means of the sexual union of two <b>differing</b> independent individuals,
each of which, again, has been brought into the world by the
sexual union of two differing individuals, the way is freely opened
for a progressive differentiation of the individuals of this species.
No one of them is exactly similar to any other. Each one exhibits<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
new peculiarities, new capabilities, and all of these play their
part in the struggle for existence. This gradually results in a
progress towards higher, better, more perfect forms. The persistence
of specific type, due to inheritance, is largely counteracted
by sexual reproduction, inasmuch as the conjugation of reproductive
cells derived from two different individuals induces a
tendency to progressive variation and improvement. Moreover, by
this sexual mode of reproduction the preservation of the species
is rendered much more secure than by asexual reproduction,
whilst at the same time the possibility of differentiation or variation
is indubitably increased. We have already insisted on the
fact that in the striking difference between the sperm cell of
the male and the germ cell of the female we must seek for the
ultimate cause of the profound difference between the sexes.
Those who maintain the theory of the absolute identity of
man and woman must continually be reminded of this fact.
Unquestionably the greater motility of the male reproductive
cell as compared with the more passive quality of the female cell
implies the existence of deeply founded psychical differences;
and the existence of these may be assumed with more confidence
since we know from experience to what a high degree the finest
psychical peculiarities of father and mother can be transmitted by
inheritance to the child.</p>

<p><b>For this reason, all attempts, whether initiated by some natural
process or by some intentional guidance of the process of civilization,
towards the obliteration of the distinction between the specific
masculine and the specific feminine, must be regarded as futile,
and as antagonistic to the process of development.</b> The production
of the so-called &#8220;third sex&#8221; is unquestionably a step backwards.
For bisexual differentiation is an <b>advance</b> upon the more
primitive form of sexual differentiation in which both the male
and the female sexual elements were produced by a single individual
(<b>hermaphroditism</b>). In the phylogeny of the human
species unilateral sexual reproduction gave place to the bilateral
type, the reproductive elements being formed within the bodies
of two <b>distinct</b> individuals&mdash;the sperm cells within the body of
the male, the germ cells within the body of the female. In this
manner originated the contrast between the individuals of the
two sexes, or bisexual differentiation, which, in the course of phylogenetic
development, has become continually more definite, more
extensive, and more characteristic, through the operation of the
principle of <b>sexual selection</b>; and thus by inheritance and adaptation
the mental and physical characteristics of sexuality, primitive
and superadded, have gradually become defined and fixed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
In the higher ranks of the animal kingdom and in the human
species, this <b>heterosexuality</b> has, through inheritance, become continually
more sharply defined; but the traces of the primitive
hermaphroditic state have never been wholly obliterated. Love
in the human species is manifested by pairing. Such is the normal
condition, and the <b>only</b> condition in harmony with the progressive
tendency towards perfection. But remnants of hermaphroditism,
of bisexuality in a single individual, of the &#8220;third sex,&#8221; are to be
found in every human being, and are disclosed by embryology
and comparative anatomy in the form of vestiges of female reproductive
organs in the male and of male reproductive organs in
the female. Herein exists an indisputable proof of the originally
hermaphrodite nature of the human ancestry. But these female
organs in the male body, and their converse, the male organs
in the female body, are <b>stunted</b>, are rudiments merely; whereas
in the course of evolution the masculine reproductive organs of
the male and the feminine reproductive organs of the female
have been more and more powerfully developed, and more and
more sharply differentiated in type, until they have come to
constitute the expression of the specific differences between man
and woman. They alone represent the more advanced stage.
Moreover, these vestiges of an early hermaphroditic condition are
in the human species far less extensive than in other mammals;
and the sexual discrepancy in the human species, as compared
with the lower animals, becomes still more noticeable when we
take into account the fact that certain parts of the reproductive
system are peculiar to mankind, are <b>new acquisitions</b>, and, above
all, the hymen, which is non-existent even in the anthropoid
apes.</p>

<p>The original purpose of the hymen, which unquestionably must
at the time of its appearance have represented an evolutionary
advance, is still undetermined. Metchnikoff has propounded an
interesting hypothesis on this subject. According to him, it is
very probable that human beings, during the earliest period of
human history, began sexual relations at an extremely youthful
age, at a time when the external genital organs of the boy were
not yet fully developed. In such a case the hymen would not only
have been no hindrance to the act of copulation, but rather,
by narrowing the vaginal outlet, and thus accommodating its
size to the relatively too small penis of the male, would have
rendered pleasure in sexual intercourse possible. In such cases,
moreover, the hymen would not have been brutally lacerated,
but gradually dilated. Laceration of the hymen represents a later
and secondary phenomenon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span></p>

<p>It is a fact that, even at the present day, among many primitive
races, marriages commonly take place in childhood, and it is
further true that even in civilized races in a considerable number
of cases (15 per cent., according to Budin) the hymen is not
always lacerated during sexual intercourse, but is retained; thus
some support is given to Metchnikoff&#8217;s hypothesis.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable that evolution and the progress of civilization
have resulted in an extremely marked differentiation between
the two sexes, and for this reason the formation of a so-called
&#8220;third sex,&#8221; in which these sexual differences are obscured, can
only be regarded as a markedly retrogressive step. Ernst von
Wolzogen, in a well-known romance, to which he gave the name
of &#8220;The Third Sex,&#8221; described a kind of barren, stunted woman,
capable, however, of holding her own at work in competition with
men; but in our opinion such women represent merely a <b>stage of
transition</b> in the great battle of women for the independent, free
development of their <b>peculiar</b> personality. Such types as these
are certainly not the final goal of the woman&#8217;s movement; they
are caricatures, products of a false and extreme conception of
woman&#8217;s development. This &#8220;third sex,&#8221; which Schurtz very
justly compares to the stunted, barren workers among ants and
bees, is incapable of prolonged existence, and will give place
to a new generation of women, who, while fully retaining their
specific feminine peculiarities, will share with men the rights and
duties of the great work of civilization; and thus this work will
unquestionably be enriched by a number of new and fruitful
elements.</p>

<p>It is indeed possible that this &#8220;third sex,&#8221; that hermaphrodites,
homosexual individuals, sexual &#8220;intermediate stages,&#8221; also play
a certain part in the great process of civilization. But their
significance is slight and limited, if for this reason alone because
from these individuals the possibility of transmission by inheritance
of valuable peculiarities is cut off, and hence the possibility
of a future perfectibility, of true &#8220;progress,&#8221; is excluded. There
are <b>two</b> sexes only on which every true advance in civilization
depends&mdash;the genuine man and the genuine woman. All other
varieties are ultimately no more than phantoms, monstrosities,
vestiges of primitive sexual conditions.</p>

<p>Very ably has Mantegazza described the intimate relationship
between these dreams of the &#8220;third sex&#8221; and the fantastic aberration
of the sexual impulse. He writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;While the pathology of love recognizes in many sexual aberrations
the obscure traces of a general hermaphroditism, imagination, which
works faster than science, shows us the possibility that in more complicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
creations sexual differentiation might be more than twofold,
so that in such worlds sexual reproduction might be effected by a more
elaborate division of labour. Thus, in the cynical or sceptical
distinction between platonic, sexual, and licentious love, we see the
first traces of new and monstrous possibilities of sexual union, on the
one hand reflecting the sublimity of the supersensual, and on the
other more brutal than the most horrible sexual aberration.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In reality, it is only for normal heterosexual love between a
normal man and a normal woman that it is possible to find an
unimpeachable sanction. Only this love, continually more
differentiated and more individualized, will play a part in the
future course of civilization.</p>

<p>Heterosexuality arises from the reciprocal attraction and the
coalescence of the reproductive cells of two individuals of distinct
sexes; it forms the foundation and constitutes the most important
element of the sexual relations of the higher animal world and of
the human species; and it obtains through inheritance continually
a more sharply defined expression. Since this fundamental
phenomenon of the sexual impulse has been transmitted from the
most ancient and simplest forms of the organic world and has
been modified only in the direction of heterosexuality, it has
come to pass, as Ewald Hering says at the end of his celebrated
lecture on &#8220;Memory as a General Function of Organic Matter,&#8221;
that organic matter has the strongest memory of the impulse
of conjugation in its most ancient and most primitive form;
thus this impulse at the present day continues to dominate
mankind as an intensely powerful physical imperative, endowed
with the strength of an elemental force, which, notwithstanding
the gradually higher development of the brain, has remained
during thousands of years undiminished in its potency, and indeed
by the accumulative influence extending through thousands of
generations has acquired a notable increase in intensity. We
must assume that for untold generations always those animals
and men have had the most numerous descendants in whom the
sexual impulse was the most powerful; this powerful impulse
being inherited, was transmitted once more to the next generation,
and tended by natural selection continually to increase.</p>

<p>This explanation of the indisputable gradual increase in the intensity
of the sexual impulse, first given by the moral philosopher
Paul R&eacute;e, is more illuminating than the theory propounded by
Havelock Ellis of the increase of the sexual impulse by civilization,
which was long ago maintained by Lucretius (&#8220;De Rerum
Natur&acirc;,&#8221; V. 1016). In support of this latter theory, it is
asserted that among savage people the genital organs are less<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
powerfully developed than among civilized races, but this can by
no means be regarded as an established fact. Civilization has
done no more than cause a fuller development of all sides of sexual
love by a multiplication of physical and psychical <b>stimuli</b>; but
it appears extremely doubtful if civilization itself is to be regarded
as the immediate causal influence in the increase of the intensity
of the sexual impulse.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">Having studied the elementary phenomena of human love
dependent upon the phylogenetic history of the human race,
namely the union of the male and female reproductive cells,
the question now arises as to the nature of the <b>psychical</b> processes,
the character of the <b>sensations</b> that accompany this union of
the sperm cells and the germ cells. What is the most primitive
<b>psychical elementary phenomenon</b> of love?</p>

<p>It is apparently that sensation in which the actual contact of
the psyche with the material occurs&mdash;an immediate sensation
of the nature of matter&mdash;namely, the <b>sense of smell</b>. The
metaphysical significance of the sense of smell has been aptly
indicated by describing that sense as the &#8220;sublimated thing-in-itself,&#8221;
as a sense which, like no other sense, allows us to enter
immediately into the nature of matter; it is, in fact, the sense of
personality.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Smell,&#8221; says Heinrich Steffens, &#8220;is the principal sense of the higher
animals; it represents for them their own inner world; it envelops
their existence. Upon smell, wherein sympathy and antipathy are
represented, is based the whole security of the higher animal instinct;
<b>for carnal desire is comprehended in this sense</b>.... Indeed, in sexual
union the subjective sensation which is developed by means of smell
blends completely with the objective, and from the monistic union
of the two arises the intenser libido, wherein the unfathomableness of
the procreative force and the whole power of sex are absorbed.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Ernst Haeckel ascribes to the two sexual cells a kind of inferior
psychical activity; he believes that they experience a sensation
of one another&#8217;s proximity; and indeed it is probably a form of
sensory activity analogous to the sense of smell that draws
them together. The sensation of the two sexual cells, which
Haeckel believes to be situated especially in the cell nuclei, he
denotes by the term &#8220;erotic chemotropism.&#8221; He attributes it
to an attraction of the nature of smell, and considers that it
represents the psychical quintessence, the original being of love.</p>

<p>A later investigator, Eugen Kr&ouml;ner, holds the same view. In
the conjugation of two vorticell&aelig; he recognizes the influence of
the chemically operative sensation of smell; to him smell is the
most important element in the sexual impulse of animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span></p>

<p>This theory is strongly supported, and indeed elevated to the
rank of a natural law, by the circumstance that in the higher
animals the sense of smell, in the course of phylogenetic development,
has attained a continually greater significance in relation
to sexuality; and by the fact that, according to the discovery
of Zwaardemaker, there exists widely diffused throughout Nature
a <b>distinct group</b> of sexual odours, the so-called <b>capryl odours</b>,
which have a natural biological connexion with the <i>vita sexualis.</i>
These capryl odours, which already in plants play a sexual part,
are in animals and in the human species localized in or near the
genital organs (odoriferous glands of the beaver, the musk-ox,
etc., the secretions of the male foreskin and the female vagina),
or in other cases are found in the general secretions, such as the
sweat. Recently Gustav Klein has succeeded in proving that a
definite group of glands in the female genital organs (glandul&aelig;
vestibulares majores, or glands of Bartholin) must be regarded
as a vestige from the time of periodic sexual excitement (rutting).
At that time in the human species, as now in the lower animals,
the sexual impulse was periodic in its activity, and the secretion
of these odoriferous glands of the human female then served as
a means of alluring members of the male sex. At the present
time these glands have for the most part lost their significance
as specific stimuli. Now it is rather the exhalation from the
entire surface of the female body which exercises the erotic
influence. Cases in which such stimuli proceed exclusively from
the female genital organs are regarded by Klein as a phylogenetic
vestige of the primitive relations between the rutting odours of
the female and sexual excitement in the male. Friedrich S.
Krauss, in his &#8220;Anthropophyteia&#8221; (1904, vol. i., p. 224), reproduces
a Southern Slavonic story in which a man is described
who obtained sexual gratification only by enjoying the <b>natural</b>
smell of the female genital organs. The remarkable classification
of Indian women according to the various odours proceeding
from their genital organs must not be forgotten in this
connexion.</p>

<p>That this primitive phenomenon of love has even to-day a
certain significance, although, in consequence of the enormous
development of the brain and the predominance of purely
psychical elements in man, its influence has been very notably
diminished, is shown by the existing physiological connexion
proved by Fliess to exist between the nose and the genital organs.
On the inferior turbinate bones there exist certain &#8220;genital
areas,&#8221; which, under the influence of sexual stimulus and excitement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
as in coitus, during menstruation, etc., swell up. From
these areas it is also possible to influence directly certain conditions
of the genital organs.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that civilization has to a large extent replaced
the natural sexual odours by artificial scents, so-called <b>perfumes</b>,
whose origin is partly due to the <b>imitation</b> or <b>accentuation</b> of the
natural odours, in part, however, and especially in recent times,
to an endeavour to <b>conceal</b> these natural odours, especially
when the latter are of a disagreeable character. For this reason,
in addition to penetrating perfumes, such as civet, ambergris,
musk, etc., we have also mild perfumes, for the most part vegetable
in origin. The markedly exciting influence of these artificial
scents is employed especially by women, above all by professional
prostitutes, in order to excite
<span class="nowrap">men.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> Frequently also the simple
perfume of flowers suffices for this purpose. Krauss tells us
that in the kolo-dance of the Southern Slavs the girls fasten
strong-scented flowers and sprigs in the front of their dress,
and thereby excite intense sexual desire in the young men. In
the East sexual stimulation by means of the sense of smell plays
a far more extensive r&ocirc;le than in Europe.</p>

<p>In the human species, however, as a specific elementary
phenomenon of sexual reproduction, smell has long been thrust
into the background by the strong development of other senses,
especially that of sight. This fact is very clearly exhibited by
the notable reduction which has occurred in the size of the organ
of smell. In man the frontal lobes of the brain, the seat of the
highest intellectual processes and of speech, have taken the place
of the olfactory lobes in the lower animals. Besides, by means
of clothing, the natural odours of men and women, which
previously had such marked sexual significance, have been
rendered almost imperceptible, and nowadays sexual stimulation
may result merely from the senses of touch and of sight, so that
the hands and the lips and the female breasts have been transformed
into erotic organs. Notwithstanding, however, the notable
weakening of the sexual significance of smell, this most primitive
sense (actually associated, as we have shown, with the activity
of the germinal cells) will never completely cease to influence
the sexual life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Still, there always surrounds us a now gently moving and now
stormy sea of odours, whose waves without cessation arouse in us
feelings of sympathy or antipathy, and to the minutest movements of
which we are not wholly indifferent&#8221; (Havelock Ellis).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Inasmuch as we have pointed out as the single prim&aelig;val basis,
as the most important elementary phenomenon, of human love,
the conjugation of the male sperm cell with the female ovum
(dependent probably upon a sensation analogous to that of smell),
we denote this particular phenomenon of sexuality as <b>primary</b>,
and we separate all the other phenomena as <b>secondary</b>, as more
remote. Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche has also expressed this difference by
denoting the union of the two reproductive cells as &#8220;<b>fusion-love</b>,&#8221;
whilst all that has occurred later, in the course of many thousands
of years of evolution, and that has transformed this primary
process, by innumerable new influences, stimuli, and perceptions,
into the love of modern civilized man, he denotes by the apt name
of &#8220;<b>distance-love</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to him,</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;the ultimate act of love in a member of the most highly civilized
community assumes the form of a sudden withdrawal from the entire
world of surrounding artifacts, of alphabets, posts, telephones, submarine
cables, etc.... At this instant the principle of union is
once again victorious, as it were, in an ultimate posthumous vision in
a vital experience of a portion of prim&aelig;val Nature, of the prim&aelig;val
world, of an instant&#8217;s profoundest self-absorption into the great
mystery of the obscure original basis of Nature, to which neither time
nor old and new is known, but which is ever renewed in us in its
elemental force&mdash;the procreative principle. At this instant the loving
individual must return home to the heart of the all-mother&mdash;it is
useless to resist. It must draw from the fountain of youth&mdash;must
descend like Odin to the Norns, like Faust to the Mothers&mdash;<b>and there
all civilization is swallowed up; there cell body must join cell body</b>,
in order in the ardent embrace to reduce to a minimum the distance
which usually sunders such large bodies. Indeed, in reality the sexual
act goes further and deeper than this reduction of separation to a minimum.
Within the body of one of the partners of the sexual act the
ovum and the spermatozoon undergo an ultimate <b>perfect fusion</b> of
soul and body, in comparison with which even the closest approximation
of the great halves of the love partnership is no more than a mere
mechanical apposition. The ultimate aim of the loving union is
attained only in the coalescence of ovum and spermatozoon.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>To express the matter briefly, fusion-love fulfils the purpose
of the species, while distance-love subserves rather the purpose
of the individual. Thus the natural course of the development
of love, which in the next chapter we propose to follow further,
affords already the proof of the thesis propounded in the introduction
regarding the duplicate nature of human love.</p>

According to Laurent (&#8220;Morbid Love,&#8221; pp. 133, 134, Leipzig, 1895), common
prostitutes generally use musk; young working women, violet or rose-water;
ladies of the bourgeoisie, penetrating perfumes, such as white heliotrope, jasmine,
and ylang-ylang; women of the half-world, finer perfumes, or such &#8220;as are

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="noindent">As we have learnt in the first chapter, the primitive phenomenon
of sexual attraction and reproduction, the conjugation of the
male and the female germinal cells, persists unaltered in man as
the most important part of the act of procreation; but this
process of &#8220;fusion-love&#8221; derived by inheritance from unicellular
organisms, is associated in man with a number of new secondary
physical and psychical phenomena of sexuality. This inevitably
results from the nature of the human organism as a cell society,
from the development of man as one of the order of mammalia,
and finally from man&#8217;s elevation above the other mammalia as a
being of enormously enhanced brain powers. The complex of
these secondary physical and psychical phenomena of love,
dependent upon the process of evolution, has, as we have already
said, been denoted by W. B&ouml;lsche by the apt name of &#8220;distance-love,&#8221;
which he thus distinguishes from the primary elemental
phenomenon of &#8220;fusion-love.&#8221; These superadded elements
play an extremely important part in human civilization, and,
indeed, actually characterize that civilization which is in no way
dependent on the primitive qualities shared by man with plants
and lower animals.</p>

<p>This secondary sexuality of mankind is, in correspondence with
the differentiation of the various organs of his body, extremely
complicated, and it is by no means solely dependent upon the
structure of the special <b>reproductive</b> or <b>copulatory</b> organs; it is
also intimately connected with other parts of the body, and
more especially with the sense organs and the nervous system.
Thus it has accommodated itself to all the external influences
to which the species has been subjected in the long course of its
development history. We may say that the <b>criterion, the
characteristic mark of distinction between the human body and
that of the lower animals, is also the distinctive differential characteristic
between human sexuality and that of the lower animals</b>.
And this criterion is the <b>brain</b>.</p>

<p>The present physical and mental constitution of man is the
result of an evolutionary process, of which the most marked
characteristic has been a continually more rapid increase in the
size and complexity of the brain. Phylogeny and ontogeny
clearly demonstrate the evolution of the human body from lower
states to higher, the slow but sure improvement in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
of a continual enlargement and increasing convolution of the brain,
which has by no means yet attained finality, but which may be
expected to continue into the far-distant future; and associated
with this physical development will undoubtedly proceed an
equally extensive improvement in the quality of human consciousness.</p>

<p>This progressive development of the brain has resulted in a
retrogression and arrest of development of other parts and organs,
and among these some more or less closely associated with the
sexual functions, and originally of considerable importance.
Gegenbaur, in his &#8220;Anatomy,&#8221; and Wiedersheim, in his interesting
work on &#8220;The Structure of Man as Bearing Witness to his
Past,&#8221; recognize in the unlimited plasticity of the human brain
the sole cause of the arrest of development and retrogressive
metamorphosis of many organs and functions which persist in
other members of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>In the sexual life, also, in correspondence with this preponderating
development of the brain, purely psychical elements continually
play a larger part, whilst parts and functions at one time
intimately related to sexuality have undergone atrophy. Thus,
as we have already pointed out, the human organ of smell had
unquestionably in earlier times much greater significance in
relation to the <i>vita sexualis</i> than it has at the present day.
Wiedersheim shows that in the ancestors of the human race this
organ was much more extensively developed, and that it must
now be regarded as in a state of atrophy. The mammary glands,
the original function of which was perhaps the production of
odoriferous substances, but which later became devoted solely
to the secretion of milk, existed in our ancestors in a larger number
than in the present human race. This is clearly shown by the fact
that the human embryo normally exhibits a &#8220;hyperthelia,&#8221; an
excess of breasts, of which, however, two only normally undergo
development; moreover, the breasts of the male, which are now in
a state of arrested development, were formerly better developed,
and served, like those of the female, the purpose of nourishing
the offspring. These facts are clearly explicable on the assumption
that at one time the number of offspring at a single birth was
considerable, and that in this way the preservation of the species
was favoured (Wiedersheim).</p>

<p>It is a very interesting fact that the principal &#8220;organ of voluptuousness&#8221;
in women, the clitoris, is notably diminished in
size absolutely and relatively as compared with the clitoris of
apes. It certainly no longer represents an organ so susceptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
to voluptuous stimulation and excitement as it was assumed to
be by the older physicians and physiologists; so that, for example,
Van Swieten, the celebrated body physician of the Empress
Maria Theresa, recommended <i>titillatio clitoridis</i> as the most
certain means of curing the sexual insensibility of his royal
patient.</p>

<p>Moreover, the common variations in the external configuration
of the female genital organs, which Rudolf Bergh has very fully
and minutely described in his &#8220;Symbol&aelig; ad Cognitionem Genitalium
Externorum Femineorum,&#8221; are largely dependent on
such arrests of development, which, indeed, occur also in the
male.</p>

<p>A very remarkable phenomenon in the course of human evolution
has been the <b>diminution in the hairy covering of the body</b>.
As compared with the other mammalia, especially those most
nearly allied to man&mdash;the anthropoid apes&mdash;man is relatively
bald. This baldness has been <b>gradually acquired</b>, and seems likely
to progress further in the future. Numerous hypotheses have
been propounded regarding the purpose and true cause of this
progressive atrophy of the hairy covering which originally
extended over the entire surface of the body. The effect of
tropical climate will not suffice to account for the change, for
in the tropics the hairy covering is useful for a covering against
the rays of the sun&mdash;witness the thick hairy coat of the tropical
apes. More apt is the idea of sexual selection, advanced by
Darwin in explanation of the loss of hair. According to this
theory, the comparatively balder women were preferred by the
men to those with a thicker covering of hair. Helbig raises the
objection that primitive man in sexual intercourse would observe
only the genital organs and the parts in their immediate neighbourhood.
Yet in this region the sexually mature woman has
retained a portion of the hairy covering of the body. We must
therefore, in order to rescue the idea of sexual selection as an
explanation of the increasing baldness of the human race, assume
that primitive man had cultivated &aelig;sthetic tastes, and was not
an extremely sensual person, and that in his choice of a partner
he would be guided by the appearance of the woman&#8217;s entire
body. This, however, is a very questionable assumption. Very
doubtful also is the suggested connexion between largely developed
dentition and the baldness of the skin (Helbig). More apposite is
W. B&ouml;lsche&#8217;s view that the atrophy of the human hairy covering
is related to the adoption of an <b>artificial covering</b>. Since that
time the thick hairy covering of the skin was felt to be burdensome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
since it hindered perspiration beneath the clothing, and
also favoured the harbouring of parasites, fleas, lice, etc., which
play so large a part in the annoyance of all hair-covered mammals.
In these circumstances bareness of skin became an ideal to
primitive man. By rubbing away the hair beneath the clothes,
by cutting it short, and by pulling it out by the roots, an artificial
baldness was produced; this then became an ideal of beauty.
Thus it happened in the choice of a partner that those individuals
less hairy than others were preferred, and thus gradually by this
process of sexual selection the race became continually less
hairy, until ultimately the relative baldness of the present day
was attained.</p>

<p>In certain parts of the body, especially in the armpits and in
the neighbourhood of the external genital organs, the thick hairy
covering has been retained. This may, perhaps, be dependent
upon the fact that from the axillary and pubic hair certain erotic
stimuli proceed, more especially certain odours. In fact, it is
possible that the hair of those regions in which strong-smelling
secretions were produced have played the part of scent-sprinklers,
analogous to the &#8220;perfume brushes&#8221; of butterflies.</p>

<p>In a similar way, the preservation of an exceptionally rich
development of the hair of a woman&#8217;s head may be explained by
the fact that therefrom erotically stimulating odours unquestionably
proceed. This circumstance has influenced sexual selection
in the direction of the preservation and continual increase in the
length of the hair of a woman&#8217;s head; while, in the opposite direction,
and equally by the process of sexual selection, the female
body has been much more fully deprived of hair than that of the
male.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that this process of loss of hair is not yet
completed. The male beard has already ceased to play the part
of a sexual lure, which it formerly undoubtedly possessed.
Schopenhauer&#8217;s opinion, that with the advance of civilization the
beard will disappear, probably represents the truth; he regarded
shaving as a sign of the higher civilization. It is certainly a
logical postulate of the natural course of
<span class="nowrap">development.<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Havelock Ellis, in &#8220;Man and Woman,&#8221; comes to the conclusion
that the bodily development of our race is a progress in the
direction of a youthful type. This is merely another way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
expressing the fact that in the case of many organs and systems,
and more especially in the case of the hairy covering of the skin,
an arrest of development has occurred, and it is a recognition of
the fact that the retrogressive metamorphosis of these organs is
a compensation for the dominating and enormous development of
the brain.</p>

<p>Parallel with this development of the brain there has occurred
a progressive development of sexuality from the lowest animal
instinct to the highest human &#8220;love.&#8221; The way of the spirit in
love becomes predominant <i>pari passu</i> with the development of
mankind in civilization. There is a profound meaning in the
saying of Schopenhauer that the transformation of the sexual
impulse into passionate love represents the victory of the intelligence
over the will. And when another writer of genius has
described the history of civilization as the history of the progress
of mankind from nearer to <b>more remote</b>, more spiritual stimuli
of pleasure, this is above all true of human love.</p>

<p>In lower states of human love these spiritual elements are
undoubtedly wanting. Amongst primitive men the manifestations
of sexuality can have differed in no wise from those of the
animals most nearly related to them. Their love was still a pure
animal instinct. The Asiatic myth which divided the earliest
periods of human history in this way, asserting that the inhabitants
of paradise loved for thousands of years merely by means
of glances, later by a kiss, by simple physical contact, until
ultimately they underwent a &#8220;fall&#8221; through adopting the
debased methods of common animal sexual indulgence&mdash;this
infantile mythology would be accurate enough if one inverted
the series of stages in the evolution of love.</p>

<p>This view is confirmed by the fact that, according to the most
recent investigation into the history of primitive man, it is
extremely probable that to pal&aelig;olithic man of the earlier diluvial
period the idea of the spiritual was still completely unknown&mdash;that
pal&aelig;olithic man was, in fact, purely a creature of impulse&mdash;an
opinion already maintained by Darwin in his work on the
&#8220;Descent of Man.&#8221; In the sexual instinct, above all, every
dualistic division into physical and spiritual was entirely foreign
to primitive man. The more primitive the state of civilization,
the less is the idea &#8220;love&#8221; known, a fact first established
by Lubbock. Even at the present day, in regard to this matter,
there is a notable difference between the upper and the lower
classes in a European civilized community. For example, Elard
Hugo Meyer, in his excellent &#8220;Deutsche Volkskunde&#8221; (&#8220;German<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
Folk-lore,&#8221; p. 152; Strasburg, 1898), states that from Eastern
Friesland to the Alps amongst the common people the word
&#8220;love,&#8221; to us so indispensable and so exalted, is entirely unknown;
in its place words expressing rather the sensual side of the
impulse are employed.</p>

<p>Rousseau suggested that primitive man embraced primitive
woman only in the fugitive moments of domination by his instinctive
impulse. It is no doubt very probable that prim&aelig;val man
shared with other animals the periodicity of the sexual impulse;
this periodicity disappeared only in the subsequent course of
human development, and traces of it yet remain. It is probable
that this periodicity of the sexual impulse was associated with
variations in the supply of nutriment, and was thus, as Darwin
assumes, a kind of natural obstacle to too rapid an increase in the
population. Later, in consequence of an increase in individual
security, and of a more enduring supply of abundant nutriment,
such periodic rutting ceased to occur, or was preserved only
in the form of menstruation (ovulation) in women, in whom
at this period there is a perceptible increase in sexual excitability.
<b>Among savage races this periodicity of the sexual impulse, its
increase at definite seasons of the year, is still clearly manifested
even in the male.</b> Heape and Havelock Ellis have carefully
studied this primitive phenomenon, and have adduced numerous
proofs of its <span class="nowrap">truth.<a id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the human female experiences true &#8220;menstruation&#8221;;
that is to say, only in women is the maturation of the ovum
accompanied by a monthly discharge of blood from the genital
passage. The so-called menstruation of female apes is limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
to a periodic swelling of the external genital organs, with a
mucous discharge therefrom. According to Metchnikoff, the
menstruation of apes constitutes the intermediate stage between
the rutting of the lower animals and the menstruation of the
human female. This latter is a new acquisition, the purpose
of which is perhaps the limitation of fertility and the prevention
of the excessively early marriage of girls.</p>

<p>With the advanced development of the brain, the old periodic
rutting, of which rudiments still persist, became more and more
subordinate to the conscious will, was transformed more and
more into enduring love. Charles Letourneau writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;If we go to the root of the matter, we find that human love is in
its essence merely the rutting season in a reasoning being; it increases
all the vital forces of the human being, just as rutting increases those
of the lower animals. If love apparently differs enormously from
rutting, this is merely due to the fact that the reproductive impulse,
the most primitive of all impulses, becomes in developed nerve centres
more diffuse in its sphere of operations, and thus in man awakens and
excites a whole province of psychical life which is entirely unknown
to the lower animals.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Philosophers and scientific observers have defined the distinction
between human and animal love as consisting in the fact
that man can love at all times, the animal periodically only;
but this distinction certainly does not apply to the beginnings
of human development; it originates beyond question with the
<b>first appearance of the spiritual element in love</b>. This alone
makes man capable of enduring love, this alone frees him from
dependence upon periodic rutting seasons. The <b>prolongation</b>
of love by the introduction of the spiritual element was already
pointed out by Kant, whose writings (especially the lesser ones)
are rich in valuable observations of a similar kind. In his
treatise published in 1786, &#8220;The Probable Beginning of Human
History,&#8221; he says regarding the sexual instinct:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Reason, as soon as it had become active, did not delay to exert
its influence also in the sexual sphere. Man soon discovered that
the stimulus of sex, which in animals depended merely on a transient
and for the most part periodic impulse, was in his own case <b>capable
of prolongation, and indeed of increase, by the force of imagination</b>.
This influence works more moderately, it is true, but with more
persistence and more evenness the more the affair is withdrawn from
the dominion of the senses, so that the satiety produced by the
gratification of a purely animal passion is avoided.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This important question regarding the origin of the love of
human beings as contrasted with the periodic instinct of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
lower animals and primitive man has hitherto, strangely enough,
hardly received any attention, notwithstanding the fact that it
is one of the most important evolutionary problems in the history
of human civilization, and represents to a certain extent the only
problem in the primitive history of love.</p>

<p>The <b>principal</b> cause of the perennial nature of human love, as
contrasted with the periodic character of the sexual impulse of
the lower animals, must, as Kant says, be sought in the appearance
of these psychical relations between the sexes. Hypotheses
such as that put forward by Dr. W. Rheinhard in his book,
&#8220;Man considered as an Animal Species, and his Impulses,&#8221;
according to which the prolonged <b>separation</b> of the sexes, consequent
on the increased difficulty in the provision of sufficient
nutriment (more especially in the Ice Age), led to an incomplete
satisfaction of the sexual impulse during the rutting season, and
thus gave rise to an <b>enduring</b> sexual excitement, cannot be
treated seriously. The same author suggests that the excessive
<b>consumption of meat</b> of the Ice Age, owing to the absence of
vegetable food, was responsible for the stronger stimulation of the
sexual impulse, and for its prolongation beyond the rutting
season.</p>

<p>Unquestionably Kant&#8217;s explanation is the only true one; it
is the one which Schiller had in his mind when in his essay on the
connexion between the animal and the spiritual nature of man,
he spoke of the happiness of the animals as of such a kind that</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;it is dependent merely upon the periods of the organism, and these
are subject to chance, to blind hazard, because this happiness rests
solely on sensation.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p class="noindent">The sexual love of primitive man was, like this, purely instinctive
and impulsive.</p>

<p>For him, beginning, course, and end, of every love-process
was &#8220;directly <b>linear</b>, with no to-and-fro oscillations into the
indefinite province of the transcendental.&#8221; The need for love
and the satisfaction of that need were in primitive man entirely
limited to the physical process of sexual activity (L. Jacobowski,
&#8220;The Beginnings of Poetry,&#8221; p. 84).</p>

<p>It was the interpenetration of the whole of sexuality with
spiritual elements which first interrupted this single line of
sensation, making in a sense two lines: hence arose the frequently
unhappy dualism between body and mind in our experience of
love; and yet at the same time it was the cause of the elevation
of human love to purely <b>individual</b> feelings, which, extending far<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
beyond the purposes of reproduction, subserved the spiritual
demands of the loving individual
<span class="nowrap">himself.<a id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Natural science, and especially the doctrine of descent, have
shown that in the higher animal world, to which we have proved
primitive man belongs, a <b>complication</b> of the sexual impulse
exists as compared to this condition in lower forms; this complication
consists mainly in the intimate association of <b>sensory
stimuli</b> with the sexual impulse. In a speech to monks, reported
in the Pali Canon, Buddha has well described the sexual part
played by the various senses:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I do not know, young men, any other <b>form</b> which fetters the heart
of man like a woman&#8217;s form.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s form, young men, fetters the heart of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, young men, any other <b>voice</b> which fetters the
heart of man like the voice of woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The voice of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, young men, any other <b>odour</b> which fetters the heart
of man like the odour of woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The odour of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, young men, any other <b>taste</b> which fetters the heart
of man like the taste of woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The taste of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, young men, any <b>touch</b> which fetters the heart of
man like the touch of woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The touch of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Then there follows, in the same rhythmical form, an enumeration
of the sexual stimuli emanating from woman through eye,
ear, smell, taste, and touch.</p>

<p>Associated with the progress towards &#8220;love&#8221; of this sexual
impulse enriched by sensory stimuli was a <b>preponderance</b>, a
prevalence, of certain particular sensory stimuli. Herein are
certainly to be found the beginnings of a spiritualization of purely
animal instincts and impulses.</p>

<p>The most important part in the amatory life of man is played,
even at the present day, by the sense of touch, and by the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
higher senses, sight and hearing, these two latter containing so
many spiritual elements.</p>

<p>The <b>sense of touch</b> is more widely extended in space than the
other senses, and for this reason touch is quantitatively the most
excitable of the senses. The stimulation of the sensory nerves
of the skin, the enormous number of which suffices to explain
the richness of sensation through the skin, experienced as touch,
tickling, or slight pain, transmits very similar sensations to the
voluptuous sensorium. The relationship between these various
modes of sensation is confirmed by the fact that the terminals of
the sensory nerves of the skin, the so-called corpuscles of Vater or
Pacini, closely resemble in structure the corpuscles of Krause
found on the glans penis and glans clitoridis, on the prepuce of
the clitoris, the labia majora, and on the papill&aelig; of the red margin
of the lip. From this point of view, the entire skin may be regarded
as a huge organ of voluptuous sensation, of which the skin
of the external organs of conjugation is most strongly susceptible
to stimulation.</p>

<p>Mantegazza therefore describes sexual love as a higher form
of tactile sensation. In human beings of a baser disposition love
is no more than a touch. Between the chaste stroking of the hair
and the violent storm of the sexual orgasm there is a quantitative,
but not a qualitative difference. The sense of touch is a
profoundly sexual sense, which at the present day plays much the
same part as was in primitive times played by the sense of smell.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The skin,&#8221; says Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche, &#8220;became the great procurer,
the dominant intermediary of love, for the multicellular animals, in
which complete conjugation of the cell bodies had become impossible,
so that their sexual gratification had to be obtained by distance-love, by
contact-love. Thus the skin was the primitive area of voluptuous sensation,
the arena of the supreme bodily triumph of this distance-love.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It has been well said that the first intentional touching of a
part of the skin of the loved one is already a half-sexual union;
and this view is confirmed by the fact that such intimate bodily
contacts, even when they occur between parts far distant from
sexual organs, very speedily lead to states of marked excitement
of these organs. Quite rightly, therefore, the pleasurable sensations
aroused by means of cutaneous sensibility are regarded by
Magnus Hirschfeld as the stages of transition along which the
power of self-command and the capacity for resisting the impulses
arising out of the transformation of sensory perceptions into
movements and actions most commonly break down. He who
avoids these first contacts, best protects himself against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
danger of being overpowered by his sexual impulse, and of
blindly following where that impulse leads&mdash;if, for example, he
wishes to avoid intercourse with a person whom he suspects to
be suffering from some venereal disease.</p>

<p>Areas of skin more especially susceptible to sexual stimulation,
the so-called erogenic areas, are those parts of the body where
skin and mucous membrane meet&mdash;above all therefore the lips,
but also the region of the anus, the female genital organs, and the
nipples of the female breast. That in certain circumstances even
the eye may be an erogenic zone is shown by the remarkable
observation of Dr. Emil Bock, that in many female patients a
gentle inunction of Pagenstecher&#8217;s ointment into the eye gives
rise to changes of countenance showing that a sexual orgasm is
occurring.</p>

<p>The contact of the lips in the <b>kiss</b> is one of the most powerful
stimuli of <span class="nowrap">love.<a id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
An Arabian author of the sixteenth century
(Sheikh Nefzawi) in his work, &#8220;The Perfumed Garden,&#8221; an Arabian
<i>ars amandi</i>, alludes to this fact. He quotes the verses of an
Arabian poet:</p>

<p>The physiologist Burdach, influenced by the then dominant
natural philosophy of Schelling, defined the kiss as &#8220;the symbol
of the union of souls,&#8221; analogous to &#8220;the galvanic contact
between a positively and a negatively electrified body; it increases
sexual polarity, permeates the entire body, and if impure transfers
sin from one individual to the other.&#8221; Goethe has very perspicuously

<p>It is therefore a true saying, that a woman who permits a man
to kiss her will ultimately grant him complete
<span class="nowrap">possession.<a id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
Moreover, by the majority of finely sensitive women the kiss is
valued just as highly as the last
<span class="nowrap">favour.<a id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem of the <b>origin</b> of the kiss, which Scheffel, in his
book (&#8220;Trompeter von S&auml;ckingen&#8221;), has treated in humorous
verse, has recently been investigated by the methods of natural
science. The lip kiss is peculiar to man and in him the impulse
to kiss is not innate, but has been gradually developed, and the
kiss has only acquired by degrees a relation to the sexual sphere.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis has recently made an interesting investigation
regarding the origin of the kiss, and has proved that the love kiss
has developed from the primitive maternal kiss and from the
sucking of the infant at the maternal
<span class="nowrap">breast,<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> which are customary
in regions where the sexual kiss is unknown. Both the sense of
touch and the sense of smell play a part in this primitive kiss,
and to simple contact primitive man superadded both licking
and biting. This primitive physiological sadism of the biting
kiss was probably inherited from the lower animals, which when
copulating often bite one another (Kleist in &#8220;Penthesilea&#8221;
writes &#8220;K&uuml;sse&#8221;&mdash;kissing&mdash;rhymes with &#8220;Bisse&#8221;&mdash;biting).
Earlier authors&mdash;as, for example, Mohnike, in his admirable essay
on the sexual instinct&mdash;have inferred from the existence of these
passionate accompaniments of the kiss that the latter has an
intimate connexion with the nutritive impulse. We have indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
the familiar expression, &#8220;I could eat you for love.&#8221; Indeed,
according to Mohnike, the frenzy of the wild kisses of passionate
love may actually lead to anthropophagy, as in a case reported
by Metzger, in which a young man on his wedding night actually
bit and began to devour his wife. Although in this case we
doubtless have to do with an insane individual, such sadistic
feelings in a lesser degree are so often observed in association
with kissing that they may be regarded as
<span class="nowrap">physiological.<a id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>In the novel &#8220;Hunger,&#8221; by Knut Hamsun, the author describes
a peculiar relationship between hunger and the <i>libido sexualis</i>.
Georg Lomer also, in the beginning of his thoughtful work,
&#8220;Love and Psychosis&#8221; (Wiesbaden, 1907), expresses the opinion
that hunger and love are not opposites, but that one is rather
the completion, the larval state, or the sublimation, of the other.
In certain species of spiders the male runs the danger, when
performing his share in sexual congress, of being actually devoured
by the stronger female.</p>

<p>The kiss by contact between the lips or neighbouring parts of
the skin is of European origin, and even here is a comparatively
recent practice, for the ancients very rarely allude to it. Its
erotic significance was early pointed out by Indian, Oriental,
and Roman poets. Amongst the Mongol races the so-called
olfactory kiss (&#8220;smell-kiss&#8221;) is in much more common use. In
this the nose is apposed to the cheek of the beloved person,
and the expired air and the odour arising from the cheek are
inhaled.</p>

<p>With the diffusion of European civilization, the European kiss of
contact has also been diffused. It is no longer possible to determine
whether the peculiar connexion between the lips and the
genital organs, as manifested for example by the growth of hair
on the upper lip at puberty in the male sex, and also by the well-known
thick &#8220;sensual&#8221; lips often seen in individuals with exceptionally
powerful sexual impulses, is originally primary, or
merely a secondary result of the employment of the lips in a
sexual <span class="nowrap">caress.<a id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>To our consideration of the kiss we may naturally append a
few remarks on the r&ocirc;le of the <b>sense of taste</b> in human love.
Inasmuch as taste is almost invariably closely connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
smell, we are rarely able to prove in an individual case whether
an impression of taste or an impression of smell more powerfully
affects the <i>vita sexualis</i>. In kissing, an unconscious tasting of the
beloved person seems often to play a part; and as regards the
kissing of other parts of the body, especially the genital organs, at
the acme of sexual excitement this undoubtedly often occurs. In
Norwegian folk-tales, and in a South Hungarian song published
by Friedrich S. Krauss, this tasting of the woman is very realistically
described. The taste for sweets has also been largely
associated with sexuality. Children who are fond of sweets,
who have, as it is called, a sweet tooth, are also sensually disposed,
sexually more excitable, and more inclined to the practice
of onanism, than other children. The sensory impulses have
therefore been classified as the hunger impulse and the sexual
impulse respectively. A certain amount of truth appears to lie
in these observations.</p>

<p>Much greater influence than these lower senses possess is exerted
in the sexual sphere on modern civilized man by the higher,
truly <b>intellectual</b> senses, <b>sight</b> and <b>hearing</b>. With the adoption
of the upright posture they gained an advantage over the sense
of smell and taste.</p>

<p>In his work &#8220;Ideas Concerning the Philosophy of Human
History&#8221; Herder writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In the beginning all the senses of man had but a small area of
action, and <b>the lower senses were more active than the higher</b>. We
see this among savages of the present day: smell and taste are their
guides, as they are in the case of the lower animals. But when man
is raised above the earth and the undergrowth, smell is no longer in
command, but the eye: it has a wider kingdom, and accustoms itself
from early childhood to the finest geometry of lines and colours. The
ear, deeply placed beneath the projecting skull, has closer access to
the inner chamber for the collection of ideas, whilst in the lower animals
the ear stands upright, and in many is so formed as to point in the
direction of the sound.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Smell, taste, and even touch, have but little &aelig;sthetic value as
compared with the two higher senses, because in the former the
material preponderates too greatly, and because they are more
closely related with the pure animal impulses than are sight and
hearing. Johannes Volkelt, in his valuable work &#8220;&AElig;sthetics,&#8221;
has carried on an interesting investigation of this question, and
comes to the conclusion that in sight and hearing perception
proceeds without any trace of the material; in touch and taste,
on the other hand, the material enormously predominates, whilst
smell stands between. Schiller wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In the case of the eye and the ear the surrounding matter is rejected
by the senses; for this reason, these two senses give the freest
&aelig;sthetic enjoyment unalloyed with animal lust.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The sense of sight is a true &aelig;sthetic sense in relation to the
<i>vita sexualis</i>; it is the first messenger of love. By means of this
sense, colour and form become sexual stimuli: by the sense of
sight the entire impression of the beloved personality is first
conveyed; sympathy and sexual attraction are almost always
at first dependent upon sight. In regard to love&#8217;s choice, sight
is unquestionably the sense of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>According to researches guided by the light of the modern
doctrine of evolution, we can no longer doubt that the beauty of
the living world is intimately connected with the sexual life, and
is indeed by this first called into being. All beauty is, to use the
words of Darwin and P. J. M&ouml;bius, &#8220;love become capable of
perception,&#8221; and, let us ourselves add, love become capable of
perception by means of the sense of sight. The figure, the
carriage, the gait, the clothing, the adornment, the observation
of the beauties of the various parts of the body of the beloved
person&mdash;all these impressions, received by means of the sense of
sight, have the most powerful erotic influence.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis also comes to the conclusion that for mankind
the ideal of a suitable love-partner is based far more upon the
<b>data of the sense of sight</b> than upon those of touch, smell, and
hearing.</p>

<p>However, in addition to the sense of sight, the sense of hearing
plays a part of considerable importance in the amatory life of
mankind. A sufficient indication of this fact is given by the
change occurring in a man&#8217;s voice at the time of puberty. Darwin&#8217;s
classical investigations prove beyond a possibility of doubt the
intimate relationship between the voice and sexual life. The
masculine voice, especially, has a sexually stimulating effect upon
woman; but the converse influence of a woman&#8217;s voice upon man
may also be observed. In the other mammalia, it is especially
in the rutting season that the voice is used as a means of sexual
allurement. The repetition of this vocal lure at measured
intervals gives rise to rhythm and song. The rhythmical repetition
of the same tone possesses something highly suggestive,
fascinating, and so gives rise to sexual attraction and charm in
the most powerful manner. Here lies the origin of the profound
erotic influence of singing and music. Darwin assumes that the
early progenitors of mankind, before they had acquired the
faculty of expressing their mutual love in articulate speech, used<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
to charm one another by musical tones and rhythms. Woman
is far more susceptible than man to the sexual influence of singing
or music, but man himself is by no means indifferent to the charms
of the beautiful feminine voice. The soft tones of a woman&#8217;s
voice are, for many men, the first enthralling disclosure of woman&#8217;s
nature. The French physician and natural philosopher Moreau
relates that he was once compelled to renounce the pleasure of
seeing the performance of a beautiful actress, for only thus could
he overcome a violent outburst of sexual passion which was
evoked in him by the mere stimulus of her voice.</p>

If at the present day an inquiry were instituted among the cultured women
of European and Anglo-American descent, whether bearded or beardless men
more nearly corresponded to their ideal of beauty, there can be little doubt that
the majority&mdash;perhaps a very large majority&mdash;would declare against a full
beard.</p>

Recently, apart from sexual periodicity, a general periodicity of vital manifestations,
more especially of the psychical phenomena associated with sexuality,
has been proved to exist in both sexes. In a work that attracted much attention&mdash;&#8220;The
Course of Life: Elements of Exact Biology&#8221; (Vienna, 1905)&mdash;Wilhelm
Fliess proved the occurrence in the human species of a twenty-three day &#8220;masculine,&#8221;
and a twenty-eight day &#8220;feminine&#8221; period. Not merely do physical
phenomena recur quite spontaneously at intervals of twenty-three and twenty-eight
days respectively, but the same is true of perceptions, feelings, and voluntary
impulses. Hermann Swoboda, a thoughtful supporter of Fliess&#8217;s theory,
has treated this question in two works&mdash;&#8220;The Periods of the Human Organism
in their Psychological and Biological Significance&#8221; (Leipzig and Vienna, 1904),
and &#8220;Studies in the Elements of Psychology&#8221; (Leipzig and Vienna, 1905). In
these he has described also twenty-three-hour and eighteen-hour vital undulations
in human beings, and has discussed the significance of this periodicity to
psychology. These researches of Fliess and Swoboda need to be confirmed by
other investigators before they can be regarded as definite additions to our
scientific knowledge. In this connexion also the older work of Carl Reinl&mdash;&#8220;Undulatory
Movements of the Vital Processes in Woman&#8221; (Leipzig, 1884)&mdash;may
be consulted. See also Van de Velde&#8217;s &#8220;Ovarian Functions, Undulatory
Movement, and Menstrual H&aelig;morrhage&#8221; (Jena, 1905).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote6"></a><a href="#FNanchor6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
Virey likewise explains the enduring nature of human love as dependent upon
an excess of potent nutritive material, whereas the poor savages of Northern
Europe and America, who must often go hungry, really experience no more than
an instant of sexual pleasure, just like the wild animals, who rut only at certain
distinct seasons. For the same reason, our domestic animals, which have a
superfluous supply of nutriment, copulate far more frequently. And in our own
case, the incessant intimate association of the sexes in our domestic life is a
continued source of ever-renewed sexual needs, even contrary to our own will.
The assumption of the <b>upright posture</b> by man, which is so intimately connected
with the preponderance of the human brain, is also regarded by Virey as &#8220;an
enduring cause of sexual excitement.&#8221; <i>Cf.</i> J. J. Virey, &#8220;Das Weib&#8221; (&#8220;Woman&#8221;),

Italian &#8220;Archives of Psychiatry,&#8221; 1904, p. 341 <i>et seq.</i>] by mechanical stimulation
of the red parts of the lips, has produced erotic ideas and congestion of the
genital organs, and this proves that the lips are an erogenic zone. Compare also
the interesting remarks of Professor Petermann and Dr. N&auml;cke on the origin of
the kiss, in the German &#8220;Archives of Criminal Anthropology,&#8221; 1904, vol. xvi.,

A kiss is on the boundary-line between erotism and sexual enjoyment.
B&ouml;lsche calls it the true transitional form between fusion-love and distance-love.
At the instant of the kiss the distance between the two lovers is certainly reduced
to a minimum; the distance-love, therefore, is on the point of becoming fusion-love.
On the other hand, however, the kiss is still simply tactile contact, and
contact of the heads only, the actual seat in mankind of the sentiment of distance-love.
The kiss represents a yearning for complete fusion-love, and yet is at the
same time a symbol of purely spiritual distance-love.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="noindent">As the progressive evolution of the multicellular organism continued,
and there occurred an increasing differentiation of the
individual portions of the body, it became necessary that the
very simple process of reproduction of the unicellular organism
(by simple cell-division or by conjugation) should, in the multicellular
organisms of the metazoa, be ensured and facilitated by
the development of new apparatus. This was all the more necessary
because, owing to the differentiation of the other organs, the
originally independent reproductive elements became more and
more dependent upon the parent organism, and lost their former
capacity for obtaining nourishment by means of their own activity.
Hence it became necessary that the period of time elapsing
between the moment when the reproductive cells were freed from
the parent organism and the moment in which they coalesced
to form a new individual should be shortened to a minimum.
This purpose is subserved by apparatus which renders possible
the <b>secure</b> and <b>rapid</b> coalescence of the two reproductive elements,
having the form of special <b>excretory canals</b> with contractile walls,
through which the two sexual elements pass. These are the
&#8220;<b>copulatory organs</b>,&#8221; by means of which the distance between
the two loving individuals is abridged. According to the exhaustive
investigations of Ferdinand Simon, the perfection and
differentiation of these conducting canals proceeds <i>pari passu</i>
with the higher development of the organism.</p>

<p>Simultaneously therewith proceeds the differentiation of the
proper internal reproductive organs, the rudiments of which are
<b>identical</b> in the two sexes. A portion of these primitively identical
structures undergoes further development in the male, another
portion undergoes further development in the female, whilst in
both sexes rudiments of the earlier condition are retained, and
these bear witness to the primitive state in which <b>both</b> reproductive
glands were present in a single individual (hermaphroditism).
In this sense Weininger&#8217;s theory applies&mdash;viz., that there is no
absolutely male and no absolutely female individual, that in
every man there is something of woman, and in every woman
something of man, and that between the two various transitional
forms, sexual &#8220;intermediate stages,&#8221; exist. Therefore, according
to this view, every individual has in his composition so many
fractions &#8220;man&#8221; and so many fractions &#8220;woman,&#8221; and according<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
to the preponderance of one set of elements or the other, he must
be assigned to one or the other sex. This theory, which Weininger
regards as his own discovery, <b>is by no means new</b>, and already
finds a place in Heinse&#8217;s &#8220;Ardinghello,&#8221; where we read:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I find it therefore necessary to assume the existence in Nature of
masculine and feminine elements. <b>That man is nearest perfection who
is composed entirely of masculine elements, and that woman perhaps is
nearest perfection who contains only so many feminine elements as to
be able to remain woman; whilst that man is the worst who contains
only so many masculine elements as to qualify for the title of man.</b>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Magnus Hirschfeld, to whom this noteworthy passage in
Heinse&#8217;s book appears to be unknown, has recently, in his valuable
monographs, &#8220;Sexual Stages of Transition&#8221; (Leipzig, 1905) and
&#8220;The Nature of Love&#8221; (Leipzig, 1906), thoroughly investigated
these relations, and quotes, among others, sayings of Darwin and
Weismann, according to which the latent presence of opposite
sexual characters in every sexually differentiated bion must be
regarded as a normal arrangement. Unquestionably the widely
diffused phenomenon of &#8220;psychical hermaphroditism,&#8221; or
&#8220;spiritual bisexuality,&#8221; is connected with the physical facts just
enumerated, and provides us with the key for the understanding
of the nature of homosexuality. Both these states&mdash;the
physical and the mental&mdash;may be referred to primitive conditions
of sexuality. They cannot play any serious part in the future
course of human evolution, of which the progressive differentiation
of the sexes is so marked a characteristic. In contrast with
this differentiation, these rudimentary sexual conditions are
practically devoid of significance. Suggestion, indeed, the influence
of momentary tendencies of the time and of transient
mental states, may temporarily deceive us. And when, for
example, Hirschfeld maintains that in the central nervous
system of women the more masculine, rational qualities, and in
the central nervous system of men the more feminine, emotional
qualities, are respectively on the increase, we must answer, in the
first place, that this is not generally true, and, in the second place,
that, in so far as it is true, it is a passing phenomenon, which has
already provoked a powerful reaction in the <b>opposite</b>
<span class="nowrap">direction.<a id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
The exuvi&aelig; of a dead condition cannot again be vitalized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span></p>

<p>The original purpose of the organs of sexual congress is, then,
to safeguard and to facilitate, in the more complicated conditions
peculiar to multicellular organisms, the conjugation of the two
reproductive cells. They do not exist, as Eduard von Hartmann
assumes, as a mere lure to voluptuousness, to induce man to
continue the practice of sexual congress, purely instinctive in his
animal ancestors, but now endangered by the development of
the higher type of consciousness. For animals without organs
of sexual congress also experience a voluptuous sensation at the
instant of the sexual orgasm and of procreation.</p>

<p>The history of evolution alone solves the riddle of the origin of
the organs of sexual congress, and renders their purpose clear to
us. In a most ingenious manner, W. B&ouml;lsche distinguishes three
problems in this history of the genital organs: the &#8220;<b>aperture-problem</b>,&#8221;
the &#8220;<b>member-problem</b>,&#8221; and the &#8220;<b>libido-problem</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first problem relates to the character and the position of
the two apertures from which the sexual products, the reproductive
cells, issue; the second relates to the exact mutual
adaptation of the male and the female reproductive apertures;
the third relates to the impulse to the intimate apposition of the
genital apertures in consequence of a powerful nervous stimulus.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fact that we encounter in our consideration
of the first problem&mdash;the &#8220;aperture-problem&#8221;&mdash;is the
intimate association between the sexual aperture and the excretory
canal of the urinary apparatus both in woman and in man&mdash;in
the latter, indeed, the association is more pronounced. There
seems to be a sort of parsimony on the part of Nature to combine
so closely these two excretory tubes of the urine and of the
products of sexual activity. Phylogenetically, indeed, the reproductive
products originally passed with the urine freely into
the open, and it was there that their conjugation took place.
Among certain worms still existing at the present day we find
this &#8220;urine-love.&#8221; Later, the genital canal became separated
from the urinary canal, but the two tubes remained partly united
at their outlets, opening side by side at the same part of the
body. In man, indeed, the urethra still subserves the double
purpose of the excretion of urine and the emission of semen.
In woman the two excretory apertures are distinct, but they
open in close proximity into the genital fissure between the thighs.</p>

<p>The intimate connexion which thus obtains between the
urinary and the reproductive organs is not without significance
for the understanding of certain aberrations of the <i>libido sexualis</i>.
The same is true of the relations between the orifice of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
genital passage and the similarly adjacent aperture of the large
intestine, the anus. &#8220;Anus,&#8221; or, better, &#8220;cloaca love,&#8221; plays
a part, indeed, in many fishes, amphibia, and reptiles; in these
the act of procreation and the excretion of urine and f&aelig;ces
all take place by way of the cloaca. Among the mammals,
at an early stage of phylogenetic development the intestine
became completely separated from the sexual rudiment and the
sexual excretory passages; and it is only in the proximity of the
respective orifices that we find an indication of the primitive
association. The act of p&aelig;derasty reminds us of the same fact.</p>

<p>The &#8220;aperture-problem&#8221; itself leads us, in the course of progressive
development, to the &#8220;member-problem&#8221;&mdash;that is to say, to
the problem of the more accurate apposition of the two reproductive
apertures. The penis, by its introduction into the body of a
member of the opposite sex, acts as a means for the shortening
of distance-love; it serves for the fixation, for the clamping
together, of the copulating pair, which in earlier stages of animal
life was effected by sucking and biting; for example, in birds,
who for the most part lack an actual penis, the cock holds the
hen firmly with his beak during intercourse, and the sucking and
biting which often occur in human beings in the sexual act persist
as a reminiscence of these relations. In various vertebrates other
means of fixation are employed: by the shape of fins, of arms, or
of legs, a close &#8220;embrace&#8221; is rendered possible; finally, the
evolution of a special member for sexual purposes closed the
long series of means of ensuring union. Originally no more
than a peg or a spine, in man the penis is first developed into the
form of an absolutely free limb. Dogs, beasts of prey, rodents,
bats, and apes, have a strong bone in the organ, the so-called
&#8220;penis-bone.&#8221; In man this bone is lacking; the penis has become
entirely free. W. B&ouml;lsche writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In relation to the large, heavy, massive trunk and thighs, the
sharply individualized, independent, mobile penis appears as a kind
of spiritualized central point; as it were, a finger or a small third hand
to the trunk, appearing to the eye to stand in rhythmical relation
with the hands, right and left.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In phylogenetic parallelism with the development of the penis,
proceeds (from the marsupials upwards) the <i>descensus testiculorum</i>,
the descent of the male reproductive glands, the testicles,
until they attain their final position in the scrotum, beneath
the penis. Here also we can recognize the principle of &#8220;limb-mobility,&#8221;
mentally refined mobility.</p>

<p>In the clitoris woman also possesses a rudiment of a primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
penis. By the apposition of the two limbs, a more complete
and rapid conjunction of the reciprocal sexual products must
have been effected. But the further development of the large
sexual aperture of the female checked the progressive development
of this primitive penis, made it to some extent superfluous, since
now, by the adaptation of the male penis to the female sexual
aperture, a sufficient internal fixation in the act of copulation was
rendered possible. Thus the female penis came to subserve other
purposes: a portion of it formed the labia minora; another
portion, the upper, the clitoris, the name of which sufficiently
indicates the fact that, like the penis of the male, its function is
connected with the voluptuous sense.</p>

<p>This leads us to the third and last problem, the &#8220;libido-problem.&#8221;
In the human species voluptuous pleasure is almost completely
divorced from the process of &#8220;fusion-love,&#8221; the coalescence of
spermatozoon and ovum, and has for the most part become a
phenomenon of &#8220;distance-love.&#8221; It appears extremely doubtful
if there is anything specific about the voluptuous sensation&mdash;whether
there is, in fact, a special &#8220;sexual sense.&#8221; Magnus
Hirschfeld assumes the existence of peculiar &#8220;sexual cells,&#8221; of
receptive areas for sexual stimuli, furnished with a sensory
substance endowed with a peculiar specific sensibility. He
regards love and the sexual impulse as &#8220;a molecular movement
or force of a quite specific quality, streaming through the nervous
system,&#8221; and accompanied by a quite peculiar sensation, or
pleasure-tone, arising from a condition of excitement of the
sexual cells. But, as we have already pointed out, the voluptuous
sensation is merely a special case of general cutaneous sensibility;
it is very closely allied with the cutaneous sensation of
tickling; properly speaking, it is no more than an <b>excessively
powerful</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>tickling</b>.<a id="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
It has also intimate relations with the sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
of <span class="nowrap">pain.<a id="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
The structure and position of the nerve-terminal
apparatus of the genital organs, by means of which voluptuous
pleasure is rendered possible, exhibit great similarity with the
touch corpuscles and sensory end-organs of other parts of the skin.
In the sexual orgasm the general cutaneous sensation increases
to so high a degree of intensity, becomes so powerful, that for
an instant <b>consciousness</b> is actually lost. The association of a
momentary loss of consciousness with the acme of sensation
indicates the summit of sexual pleasure&mdash;it is an abandonment,
a dissolution, of individual personality.</p>

<p>Voluptuous pleasure plays its part in the human species entirely
in the sphere of distance-love. B&ouml;lsche has very beautifully
described its significance in this relation:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;All-embracing in its path towards the attainment of its final aim
is the love-life also of the great cell societies, such as you yourself are,
such as I myself am, such as your beloved is. These higher, more
advanced individuals saw one another, approached one another, heard
one another, perceived one another through a hundred external media;
they became spiritually fused, and attained a condition of wonderful
harmony&mdash;their principal body walls came at length into immediate
contact&mdash;they pressed one another&#8217;s hands, they embraced one another,
kissed one another&mdash;they drew ever closer and closer together; to a
certain extent the body of one penetrated the body of the other.
In all this, <b>their</b> love undertook the <b>whole</b> affair, undertook it a
thousand times more effectually than the individual cells seeking conjunction
could ever have done; undertook it for the sake of the reproductive
cells hidden deep within their bodies. All the pleasurable
and painful feelings of love undulated and surged for so long a time
throughout the entire organism with intense force; these feelings
agitated the entire superior, comprehensive, individual personality,
searched its every depth with stormy emotions of desire, complaint,
and exultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But at a precise instant this all came to a halt. The seminal cells<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
were ejaculated; one of them conjugated with the ovum; the hidden
inward life of a tiny separate organism began within the body of one
of the over-individuals. The last separation was bridged, and the
true cell-fusion took place. But when this happened, the immediate
relationship with the love-life of the great individual man and woman
was already completely severed. The bodily act of love was already
long at an end; its increase to a climax and its fulfilment had long
passed by.</p>

<p>&#8220;The instant of supreme voluptuous pleasure, which in the case
of unicellular beings naturally occurs at the moment of complete
coalescence, must in the case of the multicellular organisms just as
naturally be <b>transferred</b> to another stage, as it were, in the great path
of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;To an earlier stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;To that stage of distance-love which is <b>nearest</b> to the true act of
fusion of the reproductive elements. To the farthest point, that is to
say, attained by the great containers of the genuine unicellular sexual
elements (themselves capable of the act of ultimate coalescence)&mdash;the
farthest point <b>attained</b> by the multicellular over-individuals.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This farthest point is an <b>act of</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>contact</b>.<a id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> We have already
learnt to regard the skin as a projection of the nervous system,
and we have come to understand the significance of the skin in
the sphere of sexuality. The other senses which have arisen from
the skin must also be taken into account in this matter. In the
genital organs, this touch stimulus assumes a quite peculiar
character; it gives rise here to the proper voluptuous sensation
which is associated with the discharge of the reproductive products.
In man this association is most distinctly manifest.
The instant of most intense sexual pleasure coincides with ejaculation,
with the expulsion of the semen. The character of this
voluptuous sensation can hardly be defined; in part, it is like an
intense tickling sensation, but, on the other hand, it has an
unmistakable relationship to pain. Later, in another connexion,
we shall consider this interesting point at greater length. Not
inaptly the sexual act has also been compared with sneezing;
the preliminary tickling sensation, with the subsequent discharge
of nervous tension, in the form of a sneeze, have, in fact, a notable
similarity with the processes occurring in the sexual act.</p>

<p>The sexual act depends upon the occurrence of certain stimuli
which are connected with the complete development of the
internal and external genital organs and of the reproductive
glands. The time when this development occurs in man and
woman is known as <b>puberty</b>. The sum of these stimuli is known
as the &#8220;<b>sexual impulse</b>.&#8221; Whereas in the lower animals the
sexual impulse is for the most part connected with the activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
of the reproductive glands, in the human species, in association
with the preponderating significance of the brain, it has attained
a relative independence of the reproductive glands; whilst the
mind has come to influence the sexual impulse very powerfully.
Generally speaking, sexual excitement is produced in three ways:
first, by the activity of the reproductive glands; secondly, by
peripheral excitement derived from the so-called &#8220;erogenic&#8221;
areas; and thirdly, by central psychical influences. S. Freud
has recently studied the relations between these three causes of
sexual excitement, of the sexual impulse, and has very properly
distinguished two stages&mdash;the stage of &#8220;<b>prelibido</b>&#8221; (sexual
desire), and the stage of the proper sexual &#8220;<b>libido</b>&#8221; (sexual
gratification).</p>

<p>The stage of prelibido has distinctly the character of tension;
the stage of libido, the character of relief. The feeling of tension
during the prelibido finds expression mentally as well as physically
by a series of changes in the genital organs. The tension is
further increased by the stimulation of the various erogenic zones.
If this prelibido increases beyond a certain degree, the characteristic
potential energy of sexual tension is transformed into the
relief-giving kinetic energy of the terminal libido, during which
the evacuation of the reproductive products occurs.</p>

<p>Prelibido, which is especially characterized by engorgement,
swelling, and erection of the corpora cavernosa of the male and
female reproductive organs, occurring as a reflex from the spinal
cord, may be experienced long before puberty; it is much more
independent of processes occurring in the reproductive glands
than is the terminal libido, or sexual gratification, which in the
male accompanies ejaculation of the semen, and is associated
with conditions attained only at puberty.</p>

<p>The actual origin of the sexual tension which ultimately leads
to ejaculation is still obscure; it seems, at first sight, probable
that in the male this sensation is connected with the accumulation
of semen in the seminal vesicles. Pressure on the walls of these
structures may be supposed to stimulate the sexual centres in
the spinal cord, and also those in the brain; but this theory fails
to take into account the condition in the child, in woman, and
in castrated males, in all of whom, notwithstanding the absence
of the accumulation of any reproductive products, nevertheless
a distinct state of sexual tension may be observed. It is, indeed,
an old experience that eunuchs may have a very powerful sexual
impulse. It is obvious, then, that the sexual impulse must be,
to a very great extent, independent of the reproductive glands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span></p>

<p>The nature of sexual tension is still entirely unknown. Freud
assumes, in view of the recently recognized significance of the
thyroid glands in relation to sexuality, that possibly some substance
generally diffused throughout the organism is produced
by stimulation of the erogenic zones, that the products of decomposition
of this substance exercise a specific stimulus on the
reproductive organs, or on the associated sexual centre in the
spinal cord. For example, such a transformation of a toxic,
chemical stimulus into a special organ-stimulus is known to occur
in the case of certain foreign poisonous materials introduced into
the body. Freud considers that the probability of this chemical
theory of sexual excitement is increased by the fact that the
neuroses referable to disturbances of the sexual life possess a
great clinical similarity to the phenomena of intoxication induced
by the habitual employment of aphrodisiac poisons (certain
alkaloids).</p>

<p>The relief of sexual tension occurs in the natural way in the
<b>sexual act</b>, in the completion of normal intercourse between man and
woman. Notwithstanding the numerous observations of leading
natural philosophers and physicians concerning the act of sexual
congress, among which I need only refer to those of Magendie,
Johannes M&uuml;ller, Marshall Hall, Kobelt, Busch, Deslandes,
Roubaud, Landois, Theopold, Burdach, and many others, we
possess, for reasons it is easy to understand, no really exact
investigations regarding the different phenomena occurring
during the sexual act. More particularly, the demeanour of the
woman during this act is a matter which remains extremely
obscure.</p>

<p>The French physician Roubaud has given us the most vivid
description of sexual intercourse:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;As soon as the penis enters the vaginal vestibule, it first of all
pushes against the glans clitoridis, which is situated at the entrance of
the genital canal, and owing to its length and to the way in which it
is bent, can give way and bend further before the penis. After this
preliminary stimulation of the two chief centres of sexual sensibility,
the glans penis glides over the inner surfaces of the two vaginal bulbs;
the collum and the body of the penis are then grasped between the
projecting surfaces of the vaginal bulbs, but the glans penis itself,
which has passed further onward, is in contact with the fine and
delicate surface of the vaginal mucous membrane, which membrane
itself, owing to the presence of erectile tissue between the layers, is
now in an elastic, resilient condition. This elasticity, which enables
the vagina to adapt itself to the size of the penis, increases at once the
turgescence and the sensibility of the clitoris, inasmuch as the blood
that is driven out of the vessels of the vaginal wall passes thence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
those of the vaginal bulbs and the clitoris. On the other hand, the
turgescence and the sensitiveness of the glans penis itself are heightened
by compression of that organ, in consequence of the ever-increasing
fulness of the vessels of the vaginal mucous membrane and the two
vaginal bulbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the same time, the clitoris is pressed downwards by the anterior
portion of the compressor muscle, so that it is brought into contact
with the dorsal surface of the glans and of the body of the penis.
In this way a reciprocal friction between these two organs takes place,
repeated at each copulatory movement made by the two parties to
the act, until at length the voluptuous sensation rises to its highest
intensity, and culminates in the sexual orgasm, marked in the male
by the ejaculation of the seminal fluid, and in the female by the
aspiration of that fluid into the gaping external orifice of the cervical
canal.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we take into consideration the influence which temperament,
constitution, and a number of other special and general circumstances
are capable of exercising on the intensity of sexual sensation,
it may well be doubted if the problem regarding the differences
in voluptuous sensation between the male and the female is anywhere
near solution; indeed, we may go further, and feel convinced that
this problem, in view of all the difficulties that surround it, is really
insoluble. So true is this, that it is a difficult matter to give a
picture at once accurate and complete of the phenomena attending
the normal act of copulation. Whilst in one individual the sense of
sexual pleasure amounts to no more than a barely perceptible titillation,
in another that sense reaches the acme of both mental and physical
exaltation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between these two extremes we meet with innumerable states
of transition. In cases of intense exaltation various pathological
symptoms make themselves manifest, such as quickening of the general
circulation and violent pulsation of the arteries; the venous blood,
being retained in the larger vessels by general muscular contractions,
leads to an increased warmth of the body; and, further, this venous
stagnation, which is still more marked in the brain in consequence
of the contraction of the cervical muscles and the backward flexion
of the neck, may cause cerebral congestion, during which consciousness
and all mental manifestations are momentarily in abeyance.
The eyes, reddened by injection of the conjunctiva, become fixed, and
the expression becomes vacant; the lids close convulsively, to exclude
the light. In some the breathing becomes panting and labouring;
but in others it is temporarily suspended, in consequence of laryngeal
spasm, and the air, after being pent up for a time in the lungs, is
finally forcibly expelled, accompanied by the utterance of incoherent
and incomprehensible words.</p>

<p>&#8220;The impulses proceeding from the congested nerve centres are
confused. There is an indescribable disorder both of motion and of
sensation; the extremities are affected with convulsive twitchings,
and may be either moved in various directions or extended straight
and stiff; the jaws are pressed together so that the teeth grind against
each other; and certain individuals are affected by erotic delirium to
such an extent that they will seize the unguarded shoulder, for instance,
of their partner in the sexual act, and bite it till the blood flows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This delirious frenzy is usually of short duration, but sufficiently
long to exhaust the forces of the organism, especially in the male, in
whom the condition of hyperexcitability is terminated by a more or
less abundant loss of semen.</p>

<p>&#8220;A period of exhaustion follows, which is the more intense in proportion
to the intensity of the preceding excitement. The sudden
fatigue, the general sense of weakness, and the inclination to sleep,
which habitually affect the male after the act of intercourse, are in
part to be ascribed to the loss of semen; for in the female, however
energetic the part she may have played in the sexual act, a mere
transient fatigue is observed, much less in degree than that which affects
the male, and permitting far sooner of a repetition of the act. &#8216;<i>Triste
est omne animal post coitum, pr&aelig;ter mulierem gallumque</i>,&#8217; wrote Galen,
and the axiom is essentially true&mdash;at any rate, so far as the human
species is concerned.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Kobelt, in his celebrated work on the human organs of sexual
pleasure (Freiburg, 1884, p. 55 <i>et seq.</i>), gave a similar description
of copulation. In the majority of descriptions of coitus
but little attention is usually paid to the demeanour of the
woman. Magendie long ago drew attention to the fact that there
was much obscurity about this matter, and insisted that, in comparison
with the male, the female exhibited extremely marked
differences, in respect to her active participation in copulation
and to the intensity of her voluptuous sensations.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Very many women,&#8221; says this distinguished physiologist, &#8220;experience
a sexual orgasm accompanied by very intense voluptuous sensations;
others, on the contrary, appear entirely devoid of sensation;
and some, again, have only a disagreeable and painful sensation.
Many women excrete, at this moment of most intense sexual pleasure,
a large quantity of mucus, but the majority do not exhibit this phenomenon.
In reference to all these phenomena, <b>there are perhaps no
two women who are precisely similar</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The demeanour of the woman <i>in coitu</i> has been especially
studied by gyn&aelig;cologists, such as Busch, Theopold, and recently
Otto Adler. Little known are the observations of Dr. Theopold,
based upon his own experience, and published in 1873. He
energetically denies the view that the woman is always passive
in coitus, and also that the female reproductive organs are inactive
during intercourse. During erotic excitement in woman the
heart beats more frequently, the arteries of the labia pulsate
powerfully, the genital organs are turgid and are hotter to the
touch. As the most intense libido approaches, the uterus
undergoes erection; its base touches the anterior abdominal
wall; the Fallopian tubes can be distinctly felt through the
abdominal wall, when these are thin, as hard, curved strings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
The vagina, especially the upper part of the passage, undergoes
rhythmical contraction and dilation, and complete gratification
terminates the act.</p>

<p>As long as the muscle guarding the vaginal outlet (constrictor
cunni&mdash;bulbo-cavernosus muscle) is intact, the woman is able,
by tightly grasping the root of the penis, to expedite the ejaculation
of semen, or to increase the stimulation of the male until
ejaculation occurs.</p>

<p>These powerful contractions of the vagina, alternating rhythmically
with the dilatations occurring during the orgasm, grip the
glans penis tightly, and induce a coaptation of the male urethral
orifice with the os uteri externum, and the enlargement of the
latter orifice facilitates the entrance of the semen. According to
O. Adler, sexual excitement of the woman during sexual intercourse
begins with very powerful congestion of the entire reproductive
apparatus, including even the fimbri&aelig; surrounding the
abdominal orifice of the Fallopian tubes; this congestion gives
rise to an erection of these parts, and especially of the clitoris,
the labia minora, and the vaginal wall. At the same time, the
glands of the vaginal mucous membrane and of the vaginal inlet
begin to secrete, as is manifest by the moistness of the external
genital organs. There now begin gentle rhythmical contractions
of the vagina and of the pelvic muscles, and during the orgasm
these increase, to become spasmodic contractions, whereby an
increased secretion is extruded, and more especially is there an
evacuation of uterine mucus.</p>

<p>It is very important to note the various physiological accompaniments
of coitus, since they assist us to understand the mode
of origin and the biological root of many sexual perversions.
Already in normal sexual intercourse sadistic and masochistic
phenomena may be observed. The biting and crying out
mentioned by Roubaud as occurring in the voluptuous ecstasy
are, indeed, of very frequent occurrence. Rudolf Bergh, the
celebrated Danish dermatologist and physician, of the Copenhagen
Hospital for Women suffering from Venereal Diseases,
alludes regularly in his annual reports to the consequences of
&#8220;erotic bites.&#8221; Amongst the Southern Slavs, the custom of
&#8220;biting one another&#8221; is very general (Krauss). The intense dark
red coloration of the face and of the reproductive organs and
their environment is also a physiological accompaniment of
sexual excitement, and this coloration is more marked in consequence
of the associated turgescence of the male and female
genital organs; it leads, moreover, to associations of feeling in<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
which the <b>blood</b> plays a dominant part. Hence we deduce the
biological and ethnological significance of the colour red in the
sphere of sexuality. The nature of the sadist &#8220;to see red&#8221;
during sexual intercourse is, therefore, firmly founded upon a
physiological basis, and merely exhibits an increase of a normal
<span class="nowrap">phenomenon.<a id="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
The crying and cursing in which many individuals
find sexual gratification has also a physiological representative
in the inarticulate noises and cries frequently expressed in normal
intercourse. It is remarkable that an Indian writer on erotics&mdash;V&#257;tsy&#257;yana&mdash;deduces
this verbal sadism from the various noises
which are commonly made in normal intercourse. Similarly, in
both parties to the sexual act the presence of masochistic elements
can be detected: witness the patience with which pain is borne
when it has a voluptuous <span class="nowrap">tinge.<a id="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing to the consideration of the <b>posture</b> adopted during intercourse,
we find in civilized man, who in this respect is far removed
from animals, the normal position during coitus is front to front,
the woman lying on her back with her lower extremities widely
separated, and the knee and hip joints semiflexed; the man lies
on her, with his thighs between hers, supporting himself on hands
or elbows&mdash;or often the two unite their lips in a kiss.</p>

<p>Of all other numerous positions during coitus, or <i>figur&aelig; Veneris</i>,
some of which, according to Sheikh Nefzawi, are possible only
&#8220;in words and thoughts,&#8221; the postures that demand consideration
on hygienic grounds are, lateral decubitus of the woman, dorsal
decubitus of the man, and coitus <i>a posteriori</i> (for example, when
man and woman are extremely obese); but this subject belongs
rather to the chapter on sexual hygiene.</p>

<p>Ploss-Bartels has proved that the position described above as
normal was usual already in ancient times and amongst the most
diverse peoples. The adoption of this position in coitus undoubtedly
ensued in the human race upon the evolution of the
upright posture. It is the natural, instinctive position of civilized
man, who in this respect also manifests an advance on the lower
animals.</p>

Apart from Strindberg and Weininger, who advocate, for the salvation of
the future and as ideals of development, the most pronounced and one-sided
development of the masculine type, I need refer only to &#8220;The Physiological
Weakmindedness of Woman&#8221; by M&ouml;bius, and to such writings as B. Friedl&auml;nder&#8217;s
&#8220;Renaissance des Eros Uranios&#8221; (Berlin, 1904), and to Eduard von
Mayer&#8217;s &#8220;The Vital Laws of Civilization&#8221; (Halle, 1904), as characteristic
symptoms of such a reaction.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote14"></a><a href="#FNanchor14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
<span class="smcap">Itching, Tickling, and Sexual Sensibility.</span>&mdash;On September 2, 1890,
Dr. Bronson, Professor of Dermatology in the New York Polyclinic, read before
the American Dermatological Association a paper on &#8220;The Sensation of Itching&#8221;
(printed in the <i>New York Medical Record</i> of October 18, 1890, and republished
by the New Sydenham Society in 1893 in a volume entitled &#8220;Selected Monographs
on Dermatology&#8221;). In this paper the author deals at some length with
the relations between itching and the voluptuous, or, as he calls it, the &#8220;aphrodisiac,&#8221;
sense. He also denies the specific character of sexual sensations, and
states that the aphrodisiac sense &#8220;is but a higher development of the primitive
sense of contact. It has a special organ or instrument&mdash;the penis in the male,
the clitoris in the female. Moreover, it is distributed over the entire cutaneous
surface&#8221; (New Sydenham Society, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 314). In this connexion, and more
particularly apropos of Dr. Bloch&#8217;s statement on the previous page that &#8220;the
function of the clitoris is expressed by its name&#8221; (German, <i>Kitzler</i>), it is interesting
to note that in German the word <i>Kitzel</i> variously denotes&mdash;(1) <i>tickling</i>,
(2) <i>itching</i>, (3) <i>sexual desire</i>, (4) <i>sexual gratification</i>. The more commonly employed
German term for itching, <i>Jucken</i>, does not possess any secondary sexual
signification; but, as Dr. Bronson points out (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 312), &#8220;both the English
words <i>itch</i> and <i>itching</i>, and the Latin <i>prurio</i> and <i>pruritus</i>, in their secondary
significations, convey the idea of a longing, teasing desire, while <i>pruritus</i> was
commonly used by the Latins as a synonym for lasciviousness.&#8221; The same
idea is, of course, conveyed by the English derivations, <i>pruriency</i> and <i>prurient</i>.
Thus, we see that the familiar terminology of these three tongues (and doubtless
of many others) refuses to countenance Hirschfeld&#8217;s view regarding the specific
character of sexual sensibility.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote15"></a><a href="#FNanchor15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
In his profound essay, containing a number of new points of view, &#8220;Concerning
the Emotions&#8221; (<i>Monatsschrift f&uuml;r Psychiatrie und Neurologie</i>, 1906,
vol. xix., Heft 3 and 4), Dr. Edmund Forster has ably discussed these primitive
relations between voluptuous sensation and pain. According to him, the sexual
tension, which commences at the time of puberty, is an increased stimulus of
the sensory nerves of the genital organs. The positive sensation-tone of libido
accompanying ejaculation represents the relief of the painful, disturbing sensation
of sexual tension, and for this reason it has a pleasurable tone.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote16"></a><a href="#FNanchor16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
Carpenter perceives in this &#8220;sense of contact&#8221; the essence of all sexual love.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote17"></a><a href="#FNanchor17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
For this reason many ingenious prostitutes wear a red chemise.&mdash;<i>Cf.</i> P. N&auml;cke,
&#8220;Un Cas de Fetichisme de Souliers,&#8221; etc. (&#8220;A Case of Shoe Fetichism&#8221;), in
<i>Bulletin de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de M&eacute;decine Mentale de Belgique</i>, 1894.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote18"></a><a href="#FNanchor18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
Thus it appears that sadism and masochism are not manifestations of &#8220;genital
atavism&#8221; in the sense of Mantegazza and Lombroso, but are rather due to the
gradual and pathological increase of physiological phenomena still manifest at
the present day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="noindent">The difference between the sexes is the <b>original cause</b> of the
human sexual life, the primeval preliminary of all human civilization.
The existence of this difference can be proved, alike in
physical and psychical relations, already in the fundamental
phenomenon of human love, in which, because here the relations
are simple and uncomplicated, it is most easily visible.</p>

<p>Waldeyer, in his notable address on the somatic differences
between the sexes, delivered in 1895 at the Anthropological
Congress in Kassel, drew attention to the fact that the higher
development of any particular species is notably characterized
by the increasing differentiation of the sexes. The further we
advance in the animal and vegetable world from the lower to the
higher forms, the more markedly are the male and the female
individuals distinguished one from another. In the human species
also, in the course of phylogenetic development, this sexual
differentiation increases in extent.</p>

<p>In the development of these sexual differences, the antagonism
first shown by Herbert Spencer to exist between reproduction
and the higher evolutionary tendency plays an important part.
Among the higher species of animals the males exhibit a stronger
evolutionary tendency than the females, owing to the fact that
their share in the work of reproduction has become less important.
The more extensive organic expenditure demanded by the reproductive
functions limits the feminine development to a notably
greater extent than the masculine. In the human species this
retardation of growth in the female is especially increased in
consequence of menstruation, and this affords a striking example
of the truth of Spencer&#8217;s law. I quote also in this connexion the
remarks of the W&uuml;rzburg anatomist Oskar Schultze, in his
recently published valuable monograph on &#8220;Woman from an
Anthropological Point of View,&#8221; pp. 55, 56 (W&uuml;rzburg, 1906);</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The undulatory periodicity of the principal functions of the
feminine organism, which depends on the processes of ovulation and
menstruation, and is invariable in the females of the human species,
does not occur in the other mammalia (with the exception of apes).
In these latter, as far as we have been able to observe, the secondary
sexual characters, in the matter of differences in muscular development
and in strength, are not so developed, or sometimes are not so
developed, as in the human species. We must in this connexion
exclude the differences which appear in domestic animals as a result<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
of domestication (for example, the difference between the cow and the
bull). In the human female, the periodicity, which begins to act even
on the youthful, still undeveloped body, has during thousands of years
increased the secondary sexual differences. Periodicity is, in my
opinion, an important cause of the fact that woman is inferior to man,
more especially in the development of the muscular system and in
strength, and that her organs, for the most part, are more closely
approximated to the infantile type.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sexually mature body of a woman has always during the intermenstrual
period to make good the loss undergone during menstruation.
Hardly has this been effected and the climax of vital energy been
once more attained, when a new follicle ruptures in the ovary, and
the menstrual h&aelig;morrhage recurs; thus continually, month after
month, the vital undulation and the vital energy rises and falls.
<b>The energy periodically expended in woman&#8217;s principal function has
for thousands of years ceased to be available for her own internal
development.</b> The actual loss on each occasion is so trifling that
numerous women hardly find it disagreeable. The effect depends
upon summation. The earnings are almost immediately spent, <b>not
for the purpose of her own domestic economy, but for the sake of
another, in the service of reproduction</b>; this comes first, for the species
must be preserved. <b>To accumulate capital for her personal needs has
been rendered more difficult for woman than it is for man.</b>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The previously quoted biological law of Spencer (regarding
the antagonism between reproduction and the higher evolutionary
tendency), of which menstruation affords so interesting an
illustration, explains also the fact pointed out by Milne Edwards,
Darwin, Brooks, Lombroso, Alfons Bilharz, and other investigators&mdash;to
wit, the greater simplicity and primitiveness of woman
as compared with the more complicated and more variable
nature of man&mdash;more variable, because it oscillates within wider
boundaries. Paracelsus long ago enunciated the profound
saying, &#8220;<b>Woman is nearer to the world than man.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be <b>fundamentally erroneous</b> to deduce from these
considerations any inferiority or comparative inutility of woman.
Rather, indeed, the nature of her bodily structure in relation
to the purposes it has to fulfil is comparatively nearer perfection;
and this admirable adaptation has undergone an increase in the
course of the evolution of civilization. We have already noted
the fact that under the influence of the continually increasing
predominance of the brain in the male, certain retrogressive
processes have also made themselves manifest (as, for example,
the increasing loss of hair); and these processes in woman have
gone farther than in man, because in her case the progressive
development is <b>in its very nature</b> less extensive. Hence recent
investigators, such as Havelock Ellis, have actually come to the
conclusion that the ideal type, towards which the bodily development<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
of mankind is striving, is represented by the feminine&mdash;that
is, by a youthful <span class="nowrap">type.<a id="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, however, very doubtful if this evolution will ever go so
far that the <b>primitive</b> difference between man and woman, founded
as it is in the very nature of the sexual, will ever pass away. On
the contrary, notwithstanding the retrogressive changes associated
with the excessive development of the brain, we find that there
is <b>an increasing differentiation of the sexes induced by civilization</b>.
To this fact, which possesses great importance in connexion with
the discussion of the woman&#8217;s question and the problem of
homosexuality, W. H. Riehl, the historian of civilization, in his
work on the family, published in 1885, was the first to draw attention.
He devotes the second chapter of this book to the
differentiation of the sexes in the course of civilized life. He was
astonished by the fact that in almost all the portraits of celebrated
beauties of previous centuries the heads appeared to him
too <b>masculine</b> in type when compared with the ideal of feminine
beauty which now appeals to us.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The medieval painters, when representing the general type of
angels and saints, van Eyck and Memmling in their Madonnas and
female saints, paint heads exhibiting the most clearly defined individual
characteristics, but into these feeling representations of delicate
virginity there intrude certain harsh lineaments, so that the heads
strike us as masculine, or as a little too old. Van Eyck&#8217;s Madonnas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
with the Christ-child at their breast, frequently look to us like women
of thirty years old. But the painter must have followed Nature;
<b>it is Nature which since his time has changed. The tender virgin of
three hundred years ago had more masculine lineaments than she has
at the present day</b>, and he who in the portrait of a Maria Stuart expects
to find a face like one he would meet in a modern journal of fashion
will find himself greatly disappointed by certain traits in the pictures
of this celebrated beauty, traits which to the nineteenth century would
seem almost masculine.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The contrast between the sexes becomes with advancing
civilization continually sharper and more individualized, whereas
in primitive conditions, and even at the present day among
agricultural labourers and the proletariat, it is less sharp and to
some extent even obliterated. Let the reader familiarize himself
with the likenesses of modern women of the working classes;
they seem to us almost to resemble disguised men. In the stature,
also, of the sexes among savage peoples, and among the lower
classes of the civilized nations, the sexual differences are much
less marked than in our cultivated large towns. Very characteristic
of the differentiating influence of civilization is, moreover,
the effect on the voice. Riehl remarks on this subject:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The tone of the voice even, in simpler conditions of civilization, is
generally far more alike in the two sexes. The high tenor, the feminine
man&#8217;s voice, and the deep alto, the masculine woman&#8217;s voice, are
among civilized peoples far rarer than among savage races, in whom
masculine and feminine varieties sometimes seem hardly distinguishable.
Our bandmasters travel to Hungary and Galicia to find clear
high tenors, whilst deep alto voices are now increasingly difficult to
find, for the reason that among the civilized peoples the masculine-feminine
contraltos die out. <b>Dominant, on the other side, is the
distinct contrast between the two sexual tones of voices&mdash;soprano and
bass.</b> This fact has already had a determining influence in our school
of song; it affects our vocal tone-teaching&mdash;to such a hidden, out-of-the-way
path have we been led by our recognition of the continually
increasing contrast between man and woman.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Certain phenomena and aberrations of the movement for the
emancipation of women, such as the adoption of a masculine
style of dress and the use of tobacco, are no more than <b>relapses</b>
into a primitive condition, which among the common people has
persisted unaltered to the present day. We need merely allude
to the man&#8217;s hat, the short coat, and the high-laced boot of the
Tyrolese women, and to the tobacco-smoking of the women at
the wedding festivals among the German peasantry. A false
&#8220;emancipation&#8221; of this kind is frequently encountered among
peasants, vagabonds, and gipsies, to which, moreover, the neuter<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
designation of the women of this class as <i>das Mensch</i> and
&#8220;woman-fellow,&#8221; etc., bears witness; we have herein characteristic
indications of the fact that &#8220;peculiar to the woman of the
people is a self-conscious, actively progressive masculine nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the comparative obliteration of sexual contrasts among
the lower orders of modern society is a vestigial relic of primitive
conditions, is shown also by the primeval history of the nations.
The idea appearing already in the Biblical creation myth, and
the thought later expressed by Plato, and recently by Jacob
B&ouml;hme, that the first human being was originally both man and
woman, and that the woman was subsequently formed out of
this primeval human being Adam&mdash;this pregnant thought merely
expresses the fact of the indifference of the sexes among savage
people and in the primitive history of mankind. The hermaphrodite
of ancient art is, like the man-woman of the modern
woman&#8217;s movement, an atavism, a retrogression to these long-past
stages, of which we have only the above-mentioned vestiges
to remind <span class="nowrap">us.<a id="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Friedrich Ratzel, in the introduction to his great work on
&#8220;The Races of Man,&#8221; also alludes to this primitive obscuration
of sexual contrasts in earlier stages of civilization, and draws
therefrom interesting conclusions regarding the existence of a
primordial gynecocracy, a &#8220;regiment of women.&#8221; I have myself
discussed this question in the second volume of my book, &#8220;Contributions
to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221; and shall
return to the subject when dealing with masochism.</p>

<p>W. H. Riehl, and after him Heinrich Schurtz, have laid stress
on the dangers to civilization involved in the obliteration of
sexual differences. Sexual differentiation stands and falls with
civilization. The former is the indispensable preliminary of the
latter. Destroy it, and the whole course of development will be
reversed.</p>

<p>Sexual differences comprise for the most part the diverse
development of the so-called &#8220;secondary sexual characters&#8221;&mdash;that
is to say, all the differential characteristics which distinguish
man from woman, over and above those strictly related
to the work of sex&mdash;for instance, stature, skeleton, muscles, skin,
voice, etc.</p>

<p>The masculine body has evolved to a greater extent than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
feminine body as a force-producing machine, for in man the
bones and the muscles have a larger development, whereas in
woman we observe a greater development of fat, whereby the
plasticity of the body is enhanced, but its mechanical utility
and energy are impaired.</p>

<p>According to the most recent scientific representation of sexual
differences, as we find them enumerated in the monograph of
Oskar Schultze, based upon his own observations, and also on
the earlier works of Vierordt, Quetelet, Topinard, Pfitzner,
Waldeyer, C. H. Stratz, J. Ranke, E. von Lange, Havelock Ellis,
Merkel, Bischoff, Rebentisch, Welcker, Schwalbe, Marchand,
and others, the most important physical differenti&aelig; between
man and woman are the following:</p>

<p>The supporting framework of the body, the osseous skeleton,
exhibits important differences in man and woman. The bones
of women are on the whole smaller and weaker. Especially
extensive sexual differences are noticeable in the pelvis. Wiedersheim
regards these sexual differences of the woman&#8217;s pelvis as
a specific characteristic of the human species. In all the anthropoid
apes they are far less strongly marked than in man. Moreover,
these differences exhibit a progressive development, which
is to an important extent dependent upon advancing civilization.
For this reason, as G. Fritsch, Alsberg, and others, point out,
among the majority of savage races the differences between the
male and the female pelvis are far less extensive than among
civilized nations. The characteristic peculiarities of the pelvis
of the European woman, which can be distinguished from the
male pelvis at a glance&mdash;namely, its greater extent in transverse
diameter, the greater depression and the wider opening
of the anterior osseous arch&mdash;are far less marked among
women of the South African races and among the South Sea
Islanders.</p>

<p>The enlargement of the female pelvis in the course of human
evolution is dependent upon the most important of all the factors
of civilization, the <b>brain</b>. Even in the human f&#339;tus the great
size of the brain gives rise to a far greater proportionate development
of the skull than we find in the f&#339;tus of any other mammal.
This influences the pelvic inlet and the sacrum, but also the large
pelvis, since, in consequence of the adoption by man of the upright
posture, the pregnant uterus expands more laterally, and thus
opens out the iliac foss&aelig;. In the lower races of man, it is precisely
this plate-like expansion of the iliac foss&aelig; which is so much less
developed than in the case of civilized races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span></p>

<p>Another physical difference between the sexes concerns <b>stature</b>
and <b>body-weight</b>.</p>

<p>The mean stature of woman is somewhat less than that of man.
Among Europeans it is about 1&middot;60 metres (5 feet 3 inches), as
compared with 1&middot;72 metres (5 feet 7<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches) for the average
stature of the male. According to Vierordt, the new-born boy
is already on the average from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 centimetre
(<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> to <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> inch)
longer than the new-born girl. Johannes Ranke characterizes
the individual factors which give rise to these differences in the
following manner:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The typical bodily development of the human male is characterized
by a trunk relatively shorter in relation to the whole stature; but in
relation to the length of the trunk, the upper and the lower extremities
are longer, the thighs and the legs longer, the hand and the foot
also longer; relatively to the long upper arm and to the long thigh
respectively, the forearm and the leg are still longer; and relatively
to the entire upper extremity, the entire lower extremity is also
longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand, the feminine proportions, remaining more
approximate to those of the youthful state, as compared with those
of the fully developed male, are distinguished by the following characteristics:
comparatively greater length of the trunk; relatively to the
length of the trunk, comparatively shorter arms and lower extremities,
shorter upper arm and forearm, shorter thigh and leg, shorter hands
and feet; relatively to the shorter upper arm, still shorter forearm,
and relatively to the shorter thigh, still shorter leg; finally, relatively
to the entire upper extremity, shorter lower extremities.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This difference in the stature is found also in primitive peoples.
Among the savage races of Brazil, who are still living in the stone
age, Karl von den Steinen found that the average height of the men
was 162 centimetres (5 feet 3&middot;8 inches), whilst that of the women
was 10&middot;5 centimetres (4&middot;14 inches) less. This difference corresponds
exactly with that given in Topinard&#8217;s figures as corresponding
to the average male height of 162 centimetres (5 feet 3&middot;8
inches).</p>

<p>In relation to the greater length of the body, the other proportions
of the male body also exhibit greater figures. More
particularly, the width of the shoulders is greater in man as
compared with woman.</p>

<p>The body-weight of man is likewise notably greater than that
of woman. According to Vierordt, the average weight of a new-born
boy in middle Europe is 3,333 grammes (7&middot;348 pounds), as
compared with that of a new-born girl 3,200 grammes (7&middot;055
pounds). The difference, therefore, is 133 grammes (0&middot;293
pounds = about 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ounces). In the case of adults, the mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
difference amounts to 7 kilogrammes (15 pounds), since the
average weight of man is 65 kilogrammes (143 pounds), that of
woman 58 kilogrammes (128 pounds).</p>

<p>Corresponding with the slighter development of the skeleton,
the <b>muscular system</b> in woman is also less strongly developed;
the muscles contain a larger percentage of water than those of
man, and in this point also we find a resemblance to the juvenile
state.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <b>the development of fat</b> in woman is much
greater than in man. Bischoff investigated the relations between
muscle and fat in man and woman, and found that in the entire
body in the male there was 41&middot;8 per cent. muscle and 18&middot;2 per
cent. fat; in the female 35&middot;8 per cent. muscle and 28&middot;2 per cent.
fat. In the female two regions of the body are distinguished
by a specially abundant deposit of fat, the breast and the
buttocks, whereby both parts receive the stamp of extremely
prominent secondary sexual characters. Upon this greater
deposit of fat depends the softer, more rounded form of the
feminine body; whilst the muscular system is less developed
than in man. Man, on the other hand, is especially powerful
in the head, neck, breast, and upper extremities. The contrast
between the typical beauty of man and woman, respectively, is
mainly explicable by the differences just enumerated.</p>

<p>Woman&#8217;s <b>skin</b> is clearer and more delicate than that of man.</p>

<p>More important is the fact that the blood of man contains a
notably larger quantity of <b>red blood-corpuscles</b> (erythrocytes)
than that of woman. Woman&#8217;s blood is richer in water. Welcker
found in a cubic millimetre of man&#8217;s blood 5,000,000, and in
the same quantity of woman&#8217;s blood 4,500,000 blood-discs.
In correspondence with this, the h&aelig;moglobin content and the
specific weight of woman&#8217;s blood are both less than those of
man&#8217;s. Since the red blood-corpuscles play a very important
part in the human economy as oxygen-carriers, this sexual
difference in the corpuscular richness of the blood is very important,
and influences to a high degree the bodily organization of
both sexes.</p>

<p><b>Larynx</b> and <b>voice</b> remain infantile in woman. Woman&#8217;s larynx
is notably smaller than man&#8217;s. After puberty woman&#8217;s voice is,
on the average, in the deep tones an octave, in the high tones
two octaves, higher than man&#8217;s.</p>

<p>According to the investigations of Pfitzner, the measurements
of the <b>head</b> (length, breadth, height, circumference) are smaller
in woman than in man. Woman&#8217;s skull remains, in respect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
numerous peculiarities of structure, strikingly like the skull of
the <span class="nowrap">child.<a id="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
This infantile quality of a woman&#8217;s skull, we must
again point out, justifies <b>no</b> conclusion regarding the inferiority
of woman. Schultze, when presenting these data for our consideration,
rightly reminds us of the well-known fact that the
man of genius is also frequently distinguished by infantile
peculiarities.</p>

<p>Woman&#8217;s skull is absolutely smaller than man&#8217;s; hence, of
course, her brain is also absolutely smaller. Waldeyer gives as the
mean weight of a man&#8217;s brain 1,372 grammes (44&middot;12 ounces), and
of a woman&#8217;s brain, 1,231 grammes (39&middot;58 ounces); Schwalbe&#8217;s
figures are respectively 1,375 grammes (44&middot;21 ounces) and
1,245 grammes (40&middot;03 ounces).</p>

<p>In this connexion O. Schultze remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The question immediately arises, whether we are justified in speaking
of the mental &#8216;inferiority&#8217; of woman, because her brain weighs
less than that of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, in the first place, it is obvious that the greater body-weight
of man demands a greater weight of brain. And there is nothing
remarkable about the fact that the greater size exhibited by many
organs of the male should be exhibited also by the brain. It seems
very natural that the unquestionably greater functional activity which
has distinguished the masculine brain for many thousand years
should be manifested by the notably greater size of that organ, just
as a larger muscle generally performs more work than a small one.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, among the numerous investigators occupied
with this question, many have assumed that differences in the
psychical power of human brains are dependent upon differences in
their size. But this is an <b>assumption</b> merely, and with Bischoff, who
as long as forty years ago conducted an exhaustive investigation into
the problem of the relations between brain-weight and intellectual
capacity, we must say also to-day that &#8216;the proof of any such connexion
has <b>not</b> yet been offered us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Whether the study of the finer structure of the brain in man
and woman will enable us to form more trustworthy conclusions
regarding their respective intellectual valuation, is a question
whose answer must for the present be postponed. According to
R&uuml;dinger and Passet, in new-born boys and girls there exist very
remarkable differences in the formation and development of the
brain. In the male f&#339;tal brain the frontal lobes are larger,
wider, and higher; the convolutions, especially those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
parietal lobe, are better formed than in the female f&#339;tal brain.
Waldeyer was able to confirm this observation, and he considers
it of great importance, especially in view of the large share which
the frontal lobes have in the performance of purely intellectual
functions. Broca, however, was unable to detect a lesser development
of the frontal lobes in woman. Eberstaller and Cunningham
even believed that they could establish that this portion of
the brain was more powerfully developed in woman! Finally,
the great Swedish cerebral anatomist, G. Retzius, made an exact
investigation of the sexual differences between the brains of man
and woman in the adult state. According to O. Schultze, his
results can be regarded as authoritative. Retzius stated that
<b>hitherto no specific invariably recurrent peculiarity had been found
by which the female brain could always with certainty be distinguished
from the male; still, he was inclined to attribute to
woman&#8217;s brain a greater simplicity of structure; it showed less
divergence from the fundamental type</b>.</p>

<p>This coincides with the fact to which we have already alluded,
that woman as compared with man possesses less variability,
that she is the simpler, more primitive being. Similarly, experience
teaches ethnologists that the men of a race differ from one
another to a much greater extent than the
<span class="nowrap">women.<a id="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>If we wish to sum up in a word the <b>nature</b> of the physical sexual
differences, we must say: <b>Woman remains more akin to the
child than man.</b></p>

<p>This, however, in no way constitutes an inferiority, as Havelock
Ellis and Oskar Schultze have convincingly shown. It is only
the expression of <b>a primitive difference in nature</b>, brought about
by the adaptation of the female body to the purposes of reproduction.
This is the cause of the more infantile habitus of
women (according to the above-quoted biological law of Herbert
Spencer).</p>

<p>The observation of the physical differences between man and
woman also teaches us the futility of the old dispute as to whether
man&#8217;s body or woman&#8217;s was the more
<span class="nowrap">beautiful.<a id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
The different<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
tasks which lie before the male and female bodies respectively
give rise to different development of individual parts. If this
development is complete in its kind, the body is beautiful. Stratz,
in the introduction to his book on &#8220;The Beauty of the Female
Body,&#8221; has rightly <b>identified perfect beauty with perfect health</b>.
Man&#8217;s body and woman&#8217;s will alike be beautiful if all secondary
sexual characters are developed in a harmonious and not excessive
degree, if the idea of &#8220;manliness in man&#8221; and &#8220;womanliness
in woman&#8221; have attained full expression, and have not
been unduly limited by isolated peculiarities and variations.</p>

<p>Masculine and feminine beauty are different. There can be
no question regarding the superiority of one or the other.</p>

Another author&mdash;H. Quensel&mdash;goes even farther than this in his book (in
some respects most fantastic), &#8220;Do We Advance? An Ideal Philosophical
Hypothesis of the Evolution of the Human Psyche based upon Natural Science,&#8221;
pp. 152, 153 (Cologne, 1904). He writes: &#8220;When we compare the position in
civilization of man and woman, we find that man unquestionably takes the
higher position in respect of those intellectual impulses which serve as the basis
of the higher and the highest stages of civilization, especially the impulse of
building and construction, of the collection and the elaboration of scientific facts,
in regard to the science of statesmanship and social activities, in respect also of
the study of the connexion between cause and effect, and in respect of art.
When, however, we apply to the problem before us the data I have obtained
concerning the details of physical retrogression and of psychical advance, it
appears that woman in many relations stands unquestionably higher than man;
for woman, in her development, not alone in bodily relations, as regards the
retrogression of the skeletal and muscular systems and the delicacy of constitution
dependent thereon, as regards the cutaneous covering of the body, and as
regards speech and voice, has advanced much farther than man on the path of
bodily retrogression necessary for the progress of civilization. Positively, also,
in all that concerns the development of the highest psychical impulses, the
development of general nervous sensibility, of a finer discrimination of moral
values and of idealism, of general charity and capacity for self-sacrifice in association
with diminishing egoism, of transcendental piety and religious sentiment,
and also of clearness of vision, and, finally, in all that concerns the development
of an adaptability disclosing supreme psychical differentiation&mdash;associated,
indeed, with deficient fixity of purpose&mdash;woman has advanced far beyond man
on the forward path of civilization; that is to say, in respect of civilization,
woman unquestionably excels man.&#8221;</p>

W. Havelburg, in his essay, &#8220;Climate, Race, and Nationality in Relation
to Marriage,&#8221; published in &#8220;Health and Disease in Relation to Marriage and
the Married State,&#8221; by Senator and Kaminer, p. 127 (London, Rebman,
Limited, 1904), also alludes to the significance of progressive sexual differentiation
in the process of civilization, and draws attention to the increase in feminine beauty.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote21"></a><a href="#FNanchor21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a>
We may refer also to Paul Bartel&#8217;s valuable work, &#8220;Ueber Geschlechtsunterschiede
am Sch&auml;del&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Sexual Differences in the Skull&#8221; (Berlin, 1898).
The author concludes: &#8220;We are unable to recognize any important difference
between man&#8217;s skull and woman&#8217;s&mdash;probably, indeed, no such difference
exists.&#8221;</p>

<p><a id="Footnote22"></a><a href="#FNanchor22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
We must not ignore the fact, that other distinguished anthropologists, such
as Manouvrier, Pearson, Frassetto, and especially Giuffrida-Ruggieri, have
recently contested the slighter variability and the infantile character of woman.

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="noindent">The unquestionably existing physical differences between the
sexes respectively, correspond equally without question to
existing <b>psychical</b> differences. Psychically, also, man and woman
are completely <b>different</b> beings. We must not employ the word
&#8220;psychical,&#8221; as it is so often employed, in the sense of pure
&#8220;intelligence&#8221;; we must understand the term to relate to the
entire conception and content of the psyche, to the whole spiritual
being&mdash;the spiritual habitus, emotional character, feelings, and
will: we shall then immediately be convinced that masculine and
feminine beings differ through and through, that they are heterogeneous,
incomparable natures.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Weininger&#8217;s book, the attempt has
recently been made to deny the existence of sexual differences
in the psychical sphere, and especially to contest the origin of
these differences from the fundamentally different nature of the
masculine and feminine types. (Weininger himself not only
went so far as to declare the obliteration and equalization of
sexual differences, but he even asserted that all feminine nature
was a personification of nothingness, of evil; he wished to annihilate
femininity, in order to allow the existence of one sex only,
the male, this being to him the embodiment of the objective
and the good.) I recently read with great interest a most intelligent
book, one full of new ideas, by Rosa Mayreder&mdash;&#8220;Zur Kritik
der Weiblichkeit&#8221; (A Critique of Femininity), Jena, 1905&mdash;in
which the author maintains what she calls the &#8220;primitively
teleological character of sexuality&#8221;; that is, she considers
the different sexual functions of man and woman to be comparatively
unimportant for the determination of their spiritual nature,
and regards the individual psychical differentiation as independent
of sexuality and of the different sexual natures. In her
opinion, sexual polarity does not extend to the &#8220;higher nature&#8221;
of mankind, to the spiritual sphere. She offers as a proof of this,
among other points, the fact that by crossed inheritance spiritual
peculiarities of the father can be transmitted to the daughter.
Very true. Moreover, no objective student of Nature will deny
that a woman can attain the same degree of individual psychical
differentiation as a man, or that she can bring her &#8220;higher
nature&#8221; to an equally great development. But quite as
incontestable is the fact which Rosa Mayreder keeps too much in<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
the background: <b>that everything psychical, the entire emotional
and voluntary life, receives from the particular sexual nature a
peculiar characterization, a distinctive colouring, and a specific
nuance</b>; and that these precisely constitute the heterogeneous
and the incomparable in the masculine and the feminine natures.</p>

<p>The attempts to annihilate sexual differences in theory are very
<span class="nowrap">old,<a id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
but they have always proved untenable in practice. They
have invariably been shattered by contact with&mdash;sexual differences.</p>

<p><i>Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret</i> (You may
drive out Nature with a pitchfork, but she will inevitably
return). And this return of Nature is, in fact, a <b>step forward</b>,
in advance of primitive hermaphroditic states. Sexual differences
are ineradicable; civilization shows an unmistakable
tendency to increase them. There is also an individual differentiation
of sexual characters. It is proportional to the differentiation
of the psychical characters of man and woman. And
the problem is this: How is it possible for woman to ensure the
development and perfectibility of her higher nature, without
eliminating and obscuring her peculiar character as a sexual being?</p>

<p>When Rosa Mayreder herself, at the end of her book (p. 278),
comes to the conclusion&mdash;</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In the province of the physical, about which no doubt is possible,
the development towards &#8216;homologous monosexuality,&#8217; towards <b>the unconditional
sexual differentiation of individuals</b>, <b>constitutes the most
desirable aim</b>. Every <b>divergence</b> from the normal renders the individual
an imperfect being; <b>physical hermaphroditism is repulsive</b>
because it represents a state of insufficiency, an inadequate and
malformed structure. It appertains to the qualities of beautiful
and healthy human beings that the body should be that of an entire
man or an entire woman, just as it is desirable that the body should
be intact in all other respects&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p class="noindent">&mdash;she has at the same time expressed a judgment regarding the
value of psychical bisexuality which <b>must ever be a rudiment
merely</b> in the &#8220;entire man&#8221; or the &#8220;entire woman,&#8221; and can<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
never attain the transcendent importance, can never represent
the progress towards higher altitudes, which the author, in her
singular misunderstanding of the true relations, wishes to ascribe
to that condition. We may admit that the bisexual character
is more or less strongly developed in the individual male or female,
without thereby abandoning the fundamental natural difference
between man and woman, which involves not merely the physical,
but also the psychical sphere.</p>

<p>I disbelieve, therefore, in Rosa Mayreder&#8217;s &#8220;synthetic human
being,&#8221; who is &#8220;subordinate alike to the conditions of the
masculine and the feminine&#8221; but I do believe, as I have already
stated in earlier writings, in an individualization of love, in an
ennobling and deepening of the relationship between the sexes,
such as is possible only to free personalities. This is easily
attainable in conjunction with the retention of all bodily and
mental peculiarities, as these have developed during the process
of sexual differentiation between man and woman.</p>

<p>There can be no possible doubt that psychically woman is a
different creature from man. And quite rightly Mantegazza
declares the opinion of Mirabeau, that the soul has no sex, but
only the body, to be a great blunder.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the directly visible elementary phenomenon
of love, to the process of coalescence of the spermatozoon
and the ovum. From our study of other natural processes we
feel we are justified by analogy in drawing the conclusion that the
observed kinetic difference between the spermatozoon and the
ovum is the expression also of different psychical processes.
Georg Hirth draws attention to these remarkable <b>differences in
respect of their modes of energy</b> between spermatozoa and
<span class="nowrap">ova.<a id="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
He also infers from the greater variability of the spermatozoa
in the different animal species, as compared with the usual
spherical form of the ova, that to the spermatozoon is allotted
the most important kinetic function in the process of reproduction,
to which opinion its aggressive mobility would also lead
us, whereas the ovum rather represents potential energy.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We can indeed hardly believe that anywhere in the entire organic
world is there anything, of the same minute size, endowed with like
energy and enterprise as these so-called spermatozoa (&#8216;little sperm
animals&#8217;), which are indeed not animals, and which yet prepare for
us more joy and more sorrow than any animal does. There everything
is busy. With what turbulence they hurry along until they attain
their ardently desired goal, and having attained it, thrust themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
head first into the interior of the ovum! In this we have a drama for
the gods. To doubt the energy of these structures would be preposterous.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Spermatozoa and ova are the original representatives of the
respective spiritual natures of man and woman. Disregarding
all further differentiation and individualization, the <b>fundamental
lineaments</b> of the masculine and feminine natures harmonize with
the demeanour of the reproductive cells; and we are able to recognize
that for each is provided a <b>different</b> task, and yet that <b>the
task of each is no less important than that of the other</b>. Quite
rightly Rosa Mayreder points out, that the male sex stands
biologically no higher than the female from the reproductive
and procreative point of view; that in the continued reproduction
of life male and female have equal share.</p>

<p>No less true, on the other hand, is the remark of Havelock
Ellis, whose position in relation to the woman question is throughout
objective:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;As long as women are distinguished from men by primary sexual
characters&mdash;as long, that is to say, as they conceive and bear&mdash;so long
will they remain unequal to man in the highest psychical processes&#8221;
(&#8220;Man and Woman,&#8221; p. 21).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The nature of man is aggressive, progressive, variable; that
of woman is receptive, more susceptible to stimuli, simpler.</p>

<p>Numerous exact, scientific, ethnological, and psychological
investigations concerning the sexes, among the most important
of which we may mention those of Darwin, Allan, M&uuml;nsterberg,
C. Vogt, Ploss-Bartels, Jastrow, Lombroso and Ferrero, Shaw,
Havelock Ellis, and Helen Bradford Thompson, have confirmed
the existence of these differences in the nature of the two sexes.
Many individual points still remain obscure, but the above-mentioned
sexual difference is everywhere recognizable, and can
never be entirely eradicated, even by a higher psychical differentiation.
Even the author of the &#8220;Critique of Femininity,&#8221; who
would open an unlimited perspective to the freedom of individuality,
is still compelled to admit that the majority of women
differ from men, no less in character than in intellect.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis, in his classical work &#8220;Man and Woman&#8221;
(London, 1892), has given a summary of the psychical differences
between the sexes, based upon the most recent anthropological
and psychological investigations. This work forms the foundation
for all later researches.</p>

<p>Of the individual psychical phenomena in man and woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
the sensory sensations first demand consideration. In these no
absolute and general superiority of one sex over the other can be
shown to exist. The assumption that women have a more
delicate power of sensory receptivity cannot be sustained;
indeed, the contrary appears the truer view. It is true that
women can be more readily excited by sensory stimuli, but they
do not possess a more delicate sensory receptivity.</p>

<p>As regards the general <b>intellectual endowment</b> of the sexes, the
interesting experimental researches of Jastrow into the psychology
of woman show that she possesses a greater interest in her
immediate environment, in the finished product, in the decorative,
the individual, and the concrete; man, on the other hand,
exhibits a preference for the more remote, for that which is in
process of construction or growth, for the useful, the general,
and the abstract.</p>

<p>In agreement with these views is a report in the <i>Berliner
St&auml;dtischen Jahrbuch</i> (1870, pp. 59-77), concerning the knowledge
possessed by several thousands of boys and girls at the time of
their entry into school. The report states:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The more usual, the more approximate, and the easier an idea is,
the greater is the probability that the girls will excel the boys, and
<i>vice versa</i>. In boys more frequently than in girls do we find that they
know nothing of quite common things in their immediate environment.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Professor Minot arranged that persons of both sexes should
cover ten cards with sketches of any subject they chose. It
appeared from this experiment that the sketches of the men
embraced a greater variety of subjects than those of the women.</p>

<p>In respect of quickness of comprehension and intellectual
mobility woman is distinctly superior to man. Women, for
example, read faster than men, and can give a better account of
what they have read. From this fact, however, no conclusion
can be drawn regarding their higher intellectual capacity, for
many men of exceptional intelligence read very slowly.</p>

<p>Delaunay inquired of a number of merchants regarding the
industrial capacity of the two sexes, and was informed that
women are more diligent than men, but less intelligent, so that
they can be trusted only in routine work.</p>

<p>In general, the experience of the postal service coincided with
what has already been stated. Havelock Ellis regarded the result
of an inquiry made at several of the large English post-offices as
&#8220;typical and trustworthy.&#8221; One of the chief postmasters was
of the opinion that as counter and instrumental clerks, doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
concurrently money-order and savings-bank business, taking in
telegrams and signalling and receiving, and in attending to rough
and illiterate persons, women clerks were preferable to men.
Women telegraphists work as intelligently and as exactly as their
male colleagues. They do not, however, like the men, exhibit
an interest in the technical working of telegraphy; and, owing to
a lack of staying power, they are unable to compete with the men
in times of pressure. The comparatively slighter strength of the
wrist made it difficult for women telegraphists to write at the
desired speed, and to produce the requisite number of copies.</p>

<p>All the reports agree in this&mdash;that</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;Women are more docile and amenable to discipline, they do light
work as well as men, and are steadier in some respects; on the other
hand, they more often remain away from work on the ground of
trifling indisposition, are more likely to fail to meet severe demands,
and show less intelligence in respect of tasks lying outside the course
of their current work, and in general show less desire and less capacity
for self-culture.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Unquestionable is the <b>greater suggestibility</b> of women, doubtless
dependent on organic peculiarities, in consequence of which
they so quickly become subject to the influence of persons and
opinions, when the latter exercise a sufficiently powerful effect
upon their emotional life. The independent, the
<span class="nowrap">poietic,<a id="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> are more
distant from women, are more foreign to their nature, than in
the case of men. But that these are quite impossible to them I
am compelled to doubt. And when, for example, Havelock Ellis
considers it unthinkable that a woman should have discovered
the Copernican system, I need merely call to mind the widely
known physical discoveries of Madame Curie, whose thoroughly
independent work qualified her to succeed her husband as professor
at the Sorbonne. We cannot therefore exclude the possibility
that in the sphere of the natural sciences notable discoveries
and inventions may be made in the future in consequence of the
independent work of women.</p>

<p>Very interesting are the observations of Paul Lafitte on the
differences between the higher intellectual qualities of man and
woman. After drawing attention to the greater receptivity of
woman, he says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;When children of both sexes are educated together, during the
first year the girls lead; at this time they have to do chiefly with the
reception and retention of impressions, and we see every day that
women put men in the shade by the vividness of their impressions and
the excellence of their memory. In addition to this we must take into<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
account the inborn sense of women for symmetry, from which it is
readily explicable that they generally receive geometrical instruction
with very beneficial results. In correspondence with this, we find that
woman students of medicine excel in the examinations in physiology
and general pathology, and show a clearness of apprehension of series
of facts which is really remarkable; on the other hand, they are
distinctly inferior in clinical investigations, in which other intellectual
qualities are involved. In general, women are more receptive for
facts than for laws, more for the concrete than for general ideas. If
we chance to hear an opinion expressed regarding someone with whom
we are acquainted, a man&#8217;s opinion will probably be more accurate
in the general outlines, but a woman&#8217;s will show a clearer perception
of the nuances of character.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Thus it is that among women concrete philosophers are greater
favourites than abstract metaphysicians. According to the
experience of a London bookseller, ladies of the West End of
London prefer Schopenhauer, Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus,
and Renan; that is to say, the most concrete, the most personal,
the most poetical, and the most religious of thinkers. This last
quality especially fascinates the mind of woman. At the same
time, want of relationship between the strong suggestibility of
woman and her slight power of independent production also
strikingly manifests itself in woman&#8217;s position with regard to
the <b>religious</b> phenomena of the spiritual life. Havelock Ellis
shows that ninety-nine in every hundred of the great religious
movements of the world have received their initial impulse
from men. And yet it has always been women who have been the
first to attach themselves to the founders of religions.</p>

<p>In contrast with this, women appear to possess more independent
significance in the sphere of <b>politics</b>, as is shown by the fact
that there has been such a large number of celebrated women
rulers. Diplomatic adroitness, finesse, and self-command, to the
extent to which these qualities favour political activity, are indeed
specific feminine peculiarities.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned greater suggestibility of woman is connected
with her greater <b>emotivity</b>; that is, woman reacts to
physical and psychical stimuli more quickly than man. The
&#8220;vasomotor theory&#8221; of the emotions, originated by Mosso and
C. Lange, is true to a greater extent of woman than of man.
Woman&#8217;s neuro-muscular system is more irritable, as is especially
shown in the case of the pupil of the eye, and in that of the
urinary bladder. By Mosso and Pellacani the bladder is termed
the most sensitive psychometer in the body. Contraction of the
bladder is well known to occur in many emotional states, such as
fear, expectation, tension, and bashfulness. This is much commoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
in women and children than in men. The fact that in
women under the influence of strong excitement there arises a
powerful impulse to urinate, is a fact extremely well known to
medical men and others with special opportunities for observation.</p>

<p>The greater neuro-muscular irritability of woman may also be
explained as the result of the relatively greater size of her abdominal
organs.</p>

<p>To this greater <b>irritability</b> of woman there corresponds a <b>greater
susceptibility to fatigue</b>. It appears as a result of any long-lasting
task; it is, in fact, a safeguard against over-exertion,
which in man so commonly leads to complete exhaustion, because
he works <b>too</b> long. The ease with which a woman becomes
exhausted is no doubt partly dependent upon the physiological
an&aelig;mia to which we alluded in the last chapter&mdash;to the larger
quantity of water and the smaller quantity of red blood-corpuscles
(erythrocytes) in her blood.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis has detected a decline in the emotivity of
modern woman, under the influence of custom and education,
especially as a result of the great diffusion of bodily sports
among girls. But he does not believe that anything of the kind
can lead to a complete abolition of the emotional differences
between the sexes, since these depend upon firmly established
bodily differences, such as the greater extension of the sexual
sphere and of the visceral functions in woman, upon woman&#8217;s
physiological an&aelig;mia, and upon the more marked periodicity of
her vital processes.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;So many factors work in combination, in order to give a basis for
the play of the emotions, whose greater extension can be overcome
by no alteration of the <i>milieu</i>, or of custom. The emotivity of woman
may be reduced to finer and more delicate shades, but it can never be
brought down to the level of the emotivity of the male sex.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In respect of <b>artistic endowment</b> the male sex is unquestionably
superior to the female. The long series of male poets, musicians,
painters, sculptors, of the highest genius cannot be matched by
any notable number of striking female personalities in the same
sphere of artistic activity. Even the art of cooking has been
further developed by men. Without doubt the differences in
sexuality are the principal causes of this deficiency. The impetuous,
aggressive character of the male sexual impulse also
favours poietic endeavours, the transformation of sexual energy
into higher plastic activity, as it fulfils itself in the moments of
most exalted artistic conception. The greater variability of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
male also serves to explain the greater frequency of male artists
of the first rank.</p>

<p>John Hunter, Burdach, Darwin, Havelock Ellis, and others,
have shown that there exists a greater tendency on the part of
man to divergence from type. In the course of evolution, man
represents the more variable and progressive, woman the more
monotonous and conservative, moiety of mankind. These
differences find no less clear expression in the psychical sphere.
Notwithstanding increasing individual differentiation&mdash;in truth,
affecting only the minority, the <i>&eacute;lite</i> among women, as Rosa
Mayreder very rightly insists&mdash;this great difference in the variability
of the sexes will ever continue. This biological fact is
certainly of great importance in respect of civilization and of the
relation between the sexes.</p>

<p>In a comparison between man and woman, the important fact
of <b>menstruation</b> must never be forgotten. Menstruation is only
the expression, only a phase, of a continuous undulatory movement
in the entire feminine organism. The intellectual and
emotional state of woman is, beyond question, a different one in
different phases of the monthly cycle. Icard, and recently
Francillon (&#8220;Essai sur la Pubert&eacute; chez la Femme&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Essay
on Puberty in Woman,&#8221; pp. 189-198; Paris, 1906), have given
us exact information on this subject.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In all tests of strength and cleverness,&#8221; says Havelock Ellis,
&#8220;the woman&#8217;s degree of strength and exactitude is related to the level
of her monthly curve. Moreover, in every criminal procedure, the
relation between the time of occurrence of the alleged crime and the
accused&#8217;s monthly cycle should invariably be taken into consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>The results obtained by Helen Bradford Thompson by experimental
research in her &#8220;Comparative Psychology of the Sexes&#8221;
(W&uuml;rzburg, 1905) agree in general with the details we have
already given as the result of earlier researches. In her experiment
also</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;man proved better developed in respect of motor capacity and
accuracy of judgment. Woman had, indeed, sharper senses and a
better memory. The opinion, however, that emotional excitement
plays a greater part in the life of woman has not been confirmed.
On the contrary, woman&#8217;s greater tendency towards religion and
towards superstition is a proof of her conservative nature, of her
function to guard established beliefs and modes of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus we cannot expel from the world the fact that man and
woman are eminently <b>different</b> alike physically and mentally.
Whether, as Alfons Bilharz declares, they are really throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
equivalent opposites, or, as he expresses the comparison, like
+1 and -1, their sum is equivalent to nil, must remain at present
undetermined. But that ineradicable differences exist is certain.
There is no question here of an inferiority to man. What woman
lacks on one side she has more of on another. She is through
and through a creature <b>constructed on other lines</b>, standing
nearer to Nature than man, and for this reason, like Nature,
<b>problematical</b>, the great guardian of the secrets of Nature
(B&auml;renbach).</p>

<p class="noindent">says Platen, thus touching an aspect of ancient German sentiment,
which has also found expression in the <i>sanctum aut providum</i>
of Tacitus. Ovid, Byron, B&ouml;rne, and Rousseau, have also
described the wonderful and mysterious influence of woman&#8217;s
nature, fundamentally different from that of man. Most
beautifully has it been described by Theodor Mundt in the
following magnificent passage of his book on Charlotte Stieglitz:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The most secret elements of woman&#8217;s nature, in association with
the magic mystery of her organization, indicate the existence in her
of peculiar and deep-lying creative ideas, and in this wonderful riddle
of love we find the sympathetic of the entire universe expressed.
The sympathetic, which attracts and binds forces, the silent music
in the innermost being of the world&#8217;s soul, by means of which the
stars, the suns, bodies, spirits, are compelled to move in this eternal,
changeable rhythm, and in this continuous opposition&mdash;is the feminine
of the universe. This is the eternal feminine, of which Goethe says
that it draws us heavenward. Therefore there is nothing deeper,
more gentle, more unsearchable, than a woman&#8217;s heart. All-movable,
it extends into that wonderful distance of existence, and hears with
fine nerves the most hidden elements of existence. Touched and
shaken by every sound, like a spiritual harp, the most hidden aspects
of nature and of life often evoke in its strings prophetic oscillations.
The feminine is something common to all life, the most gentle psyche
of existence, and hence the fine connexion of the feminine nature
with the general organizations, operations, and world forces; hence
the mysterious force of attraction which exercises itself in such a
magic manner as the true pole of sex, as though each one only in, and
with, the true feminine could first find peace.... The ancients made
a remarkable use of this idea of a common feminine element in human
nature, inasmuch as by the name they gave to the pupil of the eye
they expressed the idea that <b>a young girl was to be found in every
man&#8217;s eye</b>. Young girls (pupill&aelig;, &#954;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#953;)&mdash;these formed the centre
of the human eye, as Winkelmann points out; and is it possible to
describe the eye more aptly and distinctively, this radiant chiaroscuro
of the hidden basis of the soul, than by ascribing femininity to it&mdash;femininity,
which rises from that hidden basis of the soul as an Anadyomene
rises from the deep?&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span></p>

<p>Nietzsche speaks also of the &#8220;veil&#8221; of beautiful possibilities
with which woman is covered, and which makes the charm of her
life. This undefinable spiritual emanation, this dark, irrational
element in woman, led von Hippel to coin the clever phrase that
woman is a comma, man a full-stop. &#8220;With man, you know
where you are&mdash;you have come to an end; but with woman,
there is something more to be expected.&#8221; From this inward
nature of woman there proceed immense results: the feminine
essence is a civilizing factor of the first rank; were woman wanting,
civilization would be non-existent. Very beautifully has the
great Buckle drawn attention to the indispensability of woman
for the spiritual progress of mankind. He remarks that men,
the slaves of experience and of fact, have only the women to
thank for the fact that their slavery has not become much more
complete and more narrowing. Women&#8217;s way of thinking, their
spiritual care, their intercourse, their influence, diffuse themselves
unnoticed through the whole of society, and take their place
throughout its entire structure. By means of this influence, more
than by any other cause, we men have been conducted, says
Buckle, to a completely thought-out world.</p>

<p>This obscure, wonderful nature of woman has, however, its
shadowy side. Upon it depends that primitive, deeply-rooted
<b>antipathy of the sexes</b>, which is due to their profound heterogeneity,
to the impossibility that they can ever really understand
one another. Herein lie the roots of the brutal enslavement of
woman by man in the course of history; of the belief in witchcraft;
of contempt for women, and the continued renewal of theoretical
misogyny. The victory of sexual love over this contrast is often
apparent only. Leopardi, and Theophile Gautier (in &#8220;Mademoiselle
de Maupin&#8221;), have shown how little woman understands
the inner nature of man; how little man understands woman
has been poetically described by Annette von Droste-H&uuml;lshoff.</p>

<p>For this reason, true love is an understanding of the contrasted
natures, a solution of the riddle. &#8220;&Ecirc;tre aim&eacute;, c&#8217;est &ecirc;tre compris,&#8221;
says Delphine de Girardin.</p>

<p>What significance for the so-called &#8220;woman&#8217;s question&#8221; has
the determination of the existence of psychical sexual differences?
We answer: <b>The nature of woman, completely developed
in all her peculiarities, and enriched throughout her
being by all the spiritual elements of our times adequate to her
being, ensures her an equal share in civilization and in the progress
of humanity.</b></p>

<p>Complete equality between man and woman is impossible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
But are all sides of woman&#8217;s nature as yet adequately worked
upon, fully developed? Is not the civilized woman of the future
still to be created? The true nucleus of the woman&#8217;s movement
is, I conceive, to be found in the emancipation of woman
from the dominion of pure sensuality, and from the not less
disastrous dominion of masculine spiritual arrogance. Have we
men really any right to pride ourselves to such a degree upon our
knowledge and intelligence? Should we <b>without</b> woman have
advanced anything like so far?</p>

<p>A glance at the beginnings of human civilization should teach
us a little modesty, for there we see that woman was equal, if
not superior, to man in productive, poietic activity. Gradually
only, in the progress of civilization, man supplanted woman,
and monopolized all spheres of productive activity, whilst woman
was limited more and more to domestic occupations. According
to Karl B&uuml;cher, to women were originally allotted all the
labours connected with the obtaining and subsequent utilization
of vegetable materials, also the provision of the apparatus
and vessels necessary for this purpose; to man, on the other
hand, were allotted the chase, fishing, herding, and the provision
of weapons and tools. Thus woman was engaged in
threshing and grinding the grain, in baking bread, in the preparation
of food and drink, in the making of pots, and in spinning.
Since these occupations are largely conducted in a rhythmical
manner, and the women worked together in the fields or in their
huts, while the men hunted singly in the forests, it resulted that
women were the first creators of poetry and music.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Not,&#8221; writes B&uuml;cher, &#8220;upon the steep summits of society did
poetry originate; it sprung rather from the depths of the pure strong
soul of the people. <b>Women have striven to produce it; and as civilized
man owes to woman&#8217;s work much the best of his possessions, so also
are her thought and her poetry interwoven in the spiritual treasure
handed down from generation to generation.</b> To follow the traces of
woman&#8217;s poetry farther, in the intellectual life of the people, would be
a valuable exercise. Although these traces have to a large extent
disappeared, during the subsequent period of man&#8217;s poetic activity,
which appears to have gained predominance in proportion as men
monopolized the labours of material production, still, in a number of
races the influence of woman&#8217;s poetry can be followed for a long way
into the literary period.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><b>To a large extent men first learned from women the elements
of the various handicrafts.</b> For instance, as Mason says,
primeval woman gave her
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;ulu&#8221;<a id="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
to the saddler, and taught
him the mode of preparing leather. Women were the first discoverers<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
of numerous industries and handicrafts. The further
development of these in later times was the work of men; men
alone understood how to differentiate their work, while from the
first it was inevitable that motherhood should greatly limit the
working powers of woman.</p>

<p>In the middle ages there still existed in Europe, especially
in Germany and France, certain industries which were exclusively
in the hands of women&mdash;for instance, the silk-spinners, silk-weavers,
tailoresses, and girdle-makers. In all these occupations
there were mistresses, maids, and female apprentices.
It was not until the sixteenth century that manufactures became
a monopoly of the male sex. In the eighteenth century women
were actually forbidden by law to take part in manufactures,
until in recent times a reaction in their favour took place.</p>

<p>Therefore we must not from the present conditions judge the
capacity of women for practical activity outside the home. I
quite agree with Gerland, who assumes that during this oppression
of the female sex for thousands of years, a certain deteriorating
influence must have been exercised, and I agree also with
Havelock Ellis, who hopes much from the development in the
civilization of the future of an equal freedom for man and
woman, and who demands that we should acquire experience
by unlimited experiment regarding the qualifications of the female
sex for all departments of activity. Golden words as to the necessity
for a comprehensive emancipation of woman were uttered
in 1865 by the celebrated anthropologist Thomas Huxley, in
his essay on &#8220;Emancipation&mdash;Black and White,&#8221; in which he
strongly condemns the present system for the education of girls:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Let us have &#8216;sweet girl graduates&#8217; by all means. They will be
none the less sweet for a little wisdom; and the &#8216;golden hair&#8217; will not
curl less gracefully outside the head by reason of there being brains
within. Nay, if obvious practical difficulties can be overcome, let
those women who feel inclined to do so descend into the gladiatorial
arena of life, not merely in the guise of <i>retiari&aelig;</i>, as heretofore, but as
bold <i>sicari&aelig;</i>, breasting the open fray. Let them, if they so please,
become merchants, barristers, politicians. Let them have a fair
field, but let them understand, as the necessary correlative, that they
are to have no favour. Let Nature alone sit high above the lists,
&#8216;rain influence and judge the prize.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>And that men would maintain their old position cannot be
doubted. The only change would be that women, too, would
take part in the work of <span class="nowrap">civilization.<a id="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
They would introduce a<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
new and fresh element into this work; and inasmuch as every
woman would be brought up systematically with a view to her
life&#8217;s work, the physically and psychically disastrous idleness of
unmarried young girls, of &#8220;old maids,&#8221; and of &#8220;misunderstood
women,&#8221; would come to an end, and these unattractive types
would pass away for ever. The work of mother and housewife
must, in correspondence with these changes, be more highly
esteemed than has hitherto been the case. The technique and
the theory of domestic economy can even now, with sufficient
intelligence devoted to the question, be remodelled and transformed
to a satisfying <span class="nowrap">activity.<a id="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Woman is an integral constituent of the processes of civilization,

<h3><span class="smcap">Appendix: SEXUAL SENSIBILITY IN WOMAN</span></h3>

<p>An old and still unsettled subject of dispute is the strength and
nature of sexual sensibility in woman. Whilst the manifestation
of sexual appetite and sexual enjoyment in the male are fairly
simple&mdash;and in man, as A. Eulenburg has proved, the copulatory
impulse is much more powerful than the reproductive impulse&mdash;the
sexual sensibility of woman is still involved in obscurity.
Magendie remarked that no two women are exactly alike in
respect of their sexual sensations and perceptions. There is
no question that among women the varieties of erotic type are
far more numerous than among men. Rosa Mayreder, for
instance, distinguishes an erotic-eccentric, an altruistic-sentimental,
and an egoistic-frigid type. The attempt has been
made to prove that the last-named type is the most widely
diffused&mdash;that it is, in fact, the characteristic type of woman.
Lombroso and Ferrero were the first to maintain the slight sexual
sensibility of woman; Harry Campbell took the same view; and
recently a Berlin physician&mdash;Dr. O. Adler&mdash;has published a
book on the &#8220;Deficient Sexual Sensibility of Woman,&#8221; the conclusions
of which are that</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;the sexual impulse (desire, libido) of woman is, alike in its first
spontaneous origin and in its later manifestation, notably less intense
than that of man; and further, that libido must first be aroused in a
suitable manner, and that often it never appears at all.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Albert Eulenburg, in an article in <i>Zukunft</i> (December 2, 1893),
and later in his &#8220;Sexual Neuropathy,&#8221; pp. 88, 89 (Leipzig,
1895), first opposed this doctrine of the physiological sexual
an&aelig;sthesia of woman, and quoted in support of his view the
following passage from the writings of the celebrated gyn&aelig;cologist
Kisch:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The sexual impulse is so powerful, in certain life periods it is
an elementary force which so overwhelmingly dominates the entire
organism of woman, that it leaves no room in her mind for thoughts
of reproduction; on the contrary, she greatly desires sexual intercourse
even when she is very much afraid of becoming pregnant or when
there can be no question of any pregnancy occurring&#8221; (see Kisch,
&#8220;The Sexual Life of Woman,&#8221; English translation, Rebman, 1908).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>I have myself asked a great many cultured women about this
matter. <b>Without exception</b>, they declared the theory of the
lesser sexual sensibility of women to be erroneous; many were<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
even of opinion that sexual sensibility was greater and more
enduring in woman than in <span class="nowrap">man.<a id="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>When we actually consider the physical bases of feminine
sexuality, we must admit that women&#8217;s sexual sphere is a much
<b>more widely extended</b> one than that of men. The author of
&#8220;Splitter&#8221; has very well characterized this fact when he
says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Women are in fact pure sex from knees to neck. We men have
concentrated our apparatus in a single place, we have extracted it,
separated it from the rest of the body, because <i>pr&egrave;t &agrave; partir</i>. They
(women) are a great sexual <b>surface</b> or target; we <b>have</b> only a sexual
<b>arrow</b>. Procreation is their proper element, and when they are engaged
in it they remain at home in their own sphere; we for this purpose
must go elsewhere out of ourselves. In the matter of time also our
part in procreation is concentrated. We may devote to the matter
barely ten minutes; women give as many months. Properly speaking,
they procreate unceasingly, they stand continually at the witches&#8217;
cauldron, boiling and brewing; while we lend a hand merely in passing,
and do no more than throw one or two fragments into the vessel.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is possible, however, that the greater extension of the sexual
sphere in woman gives rise, if one may use the expression, to a
greater dispersal of sexual sensations, which are not, as they are
in man, closely concentrated to a particular point, and for this
reason the spontaneous resolution of the libido (in the form of
the sexual orgasm) is rendered more difficult.</p>

<p>Recently Havelock Ellis has made a searching investigation
into the nature of the sexual impulse in woman. He found the
following differences by which it was distinguished from the
sexual impulse of the male:</p>

<p>1. The sexual impulse of woman shows greater external
passivity.</p>

<p>2. It is more complicated, less readily arises spontaneously,
more frequently needs external stimulus, while the orgasm
develops more slowly than in man.</p>

<p>3. It develops in its full strength only after the commencement
of regular sexual intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span></p>

<p>4. The boundary beyond which sexual excess begins is less
easily reached than in man.</p>

<p>5. The sexual sphere has a greater extension, and is more
diffusely distributed than in man.</p>

<p>6. The spontaneous appearances of sexual desire have a marked
tendency to <span class="nowrap">periodicity.<a id="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>7. The sexual impulse exhibits in woman greater variability,
a greater extent of variation, than in man&mdash;alike when we examine
separate feminine individuals, and when we compare the
different phases in the life of the same woman.</p>

<p>This great extension of the feminine sexual sphere is illustrated,
for example, by the case reported by Moraglia, of a woman who
was able to induce sexual excitement by the masturbation of
fourteen different areas of her body.</p>

<p>How much more woman is sexuality than man is can be
observed in asylums, where the conventional inhibitions are
withdrawn. Here, according to Shaw&#8217;s observations, the women
greatly exceed the men in fluency, malignity, and <b>obscenity</b>;
and in this relation there is no difference between the shameless
virago from the most depraved classes of London and the elegant
lady of the upper circles. Noise, uncleanliness, and sexual
depravity in speech and demeanour, are much commoner in the
women&#8217;s wards of asylums than on the male side. In all forms
of acute mental disorder, according to Shaw, the sexual element
plays a much more prominent part in woman than in man.</p>

<p>Another experienced alienist, Dr. E. Bleuler, confirms this
permeation of woman with sexuality. In a recently published
work he remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The whole &#8216;career&#8217; in the average woman depends on sexuality;
marriage, or some equivalent of marriage, signifies to her what to
man a position in business signifies&mdash;viz., her ambition in all relations,
the happily conducted struggle for simple existence, as well as for
pleasure and for all else that life can bring, and only after these, sexuality
also, and the joy of having children. Not to marry, and also extra-conjugal
sexual indulgence, induce in woman inevitable consequences,
with strongly marked emotional colouring; to the average man all
this is a trifling affair, or it may even be a matter of absolute indifference.
And we have further to consider the limits imposed by our
civilization, which make it impossible for the well-brought-up woman
to live, and even to think, as she pleases in sexual matters, and which
demand the actual suppression of sexual emotions, not merely of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
outward manifestation of these emotions. Is it to be wondered at
that in these circumstances, in mentally disordered women, we encounter
once more the suppressed sexual feelings, those sexual feelings
which really comprise at least half of our natural existence?&mdash;I say <b>at
least</b> half, for the analogous impulse, the nutritive impulse, seems really
to be inferior in strength to the sexual impulse, in civilized as well as
in savage human beings.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In the majority of cases the sexual frigidity of woman is, in
fact, apparent merely&mdash;either because behind the veil prescribed
by conventional morality, behind the apparent coldness, there
is concealed an ardent sexuality, or else because the particular
man with whom she has had intercourse has not succeeded rightly
in awakening her erotic sensibility, so complicated and so difficult
to <span class="nowrap">arouse.<a id="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
When he has succeeded in doing so, the sexual insensibility
will in the majority of cases disappear. A striking
example of this is seen in the following case:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p><b>Case of Temporary Sexual An&aelig;sthesia.</b>&mdash;Girl twenty years of age.
Early awakening of the sexual impulses. Already practised onanism
at the age of five years; often for the sake of sexual stimulation
introduced hairpins into the vagina, until one day one of these remained,
and had to be removed by operation. Notwithstanding this,
she soon resumed masturbation, using for this purpose a finger, a
candle, etc. Ultimately this became a daily practice, which she
continued until she was eighteen years of age. She then first had
sexual intercourse with a man, in which, however, she remained quite
cold; this was the case also in subsequent attempts with this man
and with others. Finally she met a man with whom she was in sympathy,
who succeeded in inducing in her sexual gratification, by exchange
of r&ocirc;les, and corresponding alteration in the position in intercourse.
Later, intercourse in the normal position also induced complete
sexual gratification; since then onanism has been entirely discontinued,
and in coitus the orgasm occurs speedily in one or two minutes.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Where sexual frigidity in woman is enduring in character, we
have to do either with inherited influences, with sexual developmental
inhibition, the psycho-sexual infantilism of Eulenburg,
or with some disease (especially hysteria and other nervous
disorders), and with the consequences of habitual masturbation.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the sexual sensibility of woman is, as we
have seen, of quite a different nature from that of man; but in
intensity it is at least as great as that of man.</p>

The hermaphroditic idea of antiquity has repeatedly fascinated the
human spirit. It certainly cannot be denied that something great and noble
underlay this idea of overcoming sex. As long as eighty years before, Weininger
and the modern apostles of bisexuality, Johann Michael Leupoldt, Professor of
Medicine at the University of Erlangen, made the following prophecy: &#8220;<i>The
reconciliation of the sexual contrast in every human individual will some day proceed
so far</i> that, dynamically understood, <i>with the general attainment of a kind of hermaphroditism</i>,
humanity, having reached its earthly goal, will become totally
extinct&#8221; (&#8220;Eubiotik oder Grundz&uuml;ge der Kunst, als Mensch richtig, t&uuml;chtig,

On this subject one of our most celebrated economists writes as follows:
&#8220;Let us observe what to-day a good housewife of the middle class is able to
get through in the way of domestic and hygienic activity, and of the education
of children, and by means of the knowledge and employment of domestic
machines; let us not overlook in what a one-sided way the great advances in
natural science and in the mechanical arts have hitherto been devoted to the
service of the great industries, what enormous economies are still possible if the
same knowledge and intelligence are devoted to the amelioration of domestic
service. Only the rough, barbarous housewife of the lower classes can say, &#8216;I
have no more to-day to do in the house.&#8217; When the mode of life is a healthy one,
when to every dwelling-house is attached a garden, the housewife even to-day
is fully occupied, and in the future will be still more so, notwithstanding all the
schools that come to her assistance, all the shops, all the trades; notwithstanding
all the products, including food-products, which nowadays she buys ready-made.
And besides her domestic activity, she has to find time for lectures, for culture,
for music, and for various socially useful activities&mdash;even women of quite the
lower classes. Without this no social cure is possible.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Schmoller</span>, &#8220;Elements
of General Domestic Economy,&#8221; vol. i., p. 253 (Leipzig, 1901).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Simplification of Household Duties.</span>&mdash;English readers will find the
questions briefly touched upon in this note&mdash;the enslavement of woman by
an unceasing round of petty domestic toil, the necessity for devoting the same
amount of finished intelligence to these domestic problems that has been devoted
to &#8220;labour-saving&#8221; in most departments of masculine activity, and the lines
on which future progress may be expected to move, bringing about in this way
alone a much-needed &#8220;emancipation&#8221; of women&mdash;fully discussed by Mr. H. G.
Wells in his sociological studies. See &#8220;Anticipations,&#8221; &#8220;Mankind in the Making,&#8221;

Noteworthy is the following utterance of a clergyman regarding the sensuality
of country girls: &#8220;Young women are in no way behind young men in
the strength of their fleshly lusts; they are only too willing to be seduced&mdash;so
<b>willing</b> that even older girls frequently give themselves to half-grown boys, and
<b>girls give themselves to several men in brief succession</b>. Moreover, it is by
no means always the young men by whom the seduction is effected. Often enough
<b>it is the girls who lure the lads to sexual intercourse</b>, in which case they do
not wait till the lads come to their rooms, but they go themselves to the young
men&#8217;s bedrooms, or wait for them in their beds.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Wagner</span>, &#8220;The State of
Affairs as Regards Sexual Morality among the Evangelical Agricultural Population

E. Heinrich Kisch (&#8220;The Sexual Life of Woman,&#8221; English translation, Rebman,
1908) names the <b>ovaries</b> &#8220;regulators of the sexual impulse.&#8221; In the ovary,
and in the periodical changes that occur in that organ, are to be found the fundamental
cause, and the means of regulation, of the <b>sexual impulse</b>; in the clitoris
is the seat of <b>voluptuous sensibility</b>.</p>

Georg Hirth remarks very aptly (&#8220;Ways to Love,&#8221; Munich, 1906,
p. 570): &#8220;For it is the task of the man to summon his whole power of self-command,
to employ all his skill, to take all the care in his power, that the
woman may be, as one says, &#8216;ready.&#8217; The man who thinks only of his own
gratification, and who leaves his partner ungratified, is a brutal being, or, if not
brutal, he is simply ignorant of the harm he is doing.... In general, the man
has the <i>tempo</i> of gratification much better and more securely under control than
the woman; in many women, indeed, the sexual orgasm is very difficult to
induce, and in such cases the man must help with skill and tenderness.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="noindent">If, with Friedrich Ratzel, we understand by civilization the
sum total of all the mental acquirements of a period, then also
human love, this specific product of civilization, is merely a
mirrored picture of the mental activities of the existing epoch
of civilization. We can follow this <b>way of the spirit in love</b>
from the primitive age down to the present day, and we can
detect, in each successive epoch of civilization, the association
with sexuality of peculiar spiritual states; and after thus passing in
review the thousands of years of human history, we can discern
once more in our own epoch the individual psychical elements
which characterize the love of modern civilized man.</p>

<p>The increasing spiritualization and idealization of sensuality
in the course of civilization, <b>notwithstanding</b> the persistence of
the elementary intensity of the sexual impulse, is associated with
the fact to which we have already alluded&mdash;namely, the preponderance
of the brain characteristic of the genus homo&mdash;a preponderance
which was unquestionably gradually acquired, and
arose in consequence of an accumulation of original variations
which gave their possessors a certain advantage in the struggle
for existence.</p>

<p>Thus very gradually the primary, instinctive, still powerful
animal ego underwent expansion into the secondary ego (in
Meynert&#8217;s sense), into the <b>spiritual personality</b>, to which a fixed
foundation was given by the possession of <b>speech</b>. With some
justice the origin of speech has been singled out as extremely
significant for the development of the feeling of love; and the
conquest of the primitive animal instinct has been, above all,
attributed to this faculty. A. Cabral, in his interesting work,
&#8220;La V&eacute;nus G&eacute;nitrix&#8221; (Paris, 1882, p. 155), expresses the opinion
that speech and song developed solely on account of sexual
relations; and he alludes in support of this view to the well-known
manifold noises made by various animals in conditions of
sexual excitement. It is very significant in this connexion that
anthropological science has proved, as an important fact in racial
psychology, that the development of poetry <b>preceded</b> that of
<span class="nowrap">prose.<a id="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
The original form of speech was rhythmical noise, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
poem, a song. And we saw above that this was subservient to
more suggestive purposes, and, above all, to sexual allurement.
Thus the primitive natural connexion between speech and
sexuality appears somewhat probable. With these earlier erotic
noises and alluring tones were subsequently associated the first
elements of intellectual comprehension, the first <b>thoughts</b>.</p>

<p>This &#8220;withdrawal of mankind from pure instinct,&#8221; which
Schiller, in his essay on the earliest human society, describes as
the &#8220;most fortunate and most important occurrence in human
history,&#8221; from which time the struggle towards freedom may be
said to begin, gradually enabled the higher <b>feeling-tones</b> of
sensation to become more predominant. The elementary
impulses became associated with sensations of pleasure and pain
as psychical reactions. The &#8220;organic sensations&#8221; entered the
sphere of consciousness, and so gave rise, in association and
reciprocal working with the higher sensory stimuli, to the
psychico-emotional roots of the impulses. Thus, in the sexual
sphere, out of pure voluptuousness, the simple instinctive impulse
towards copulation, arose <b>love</b>, whose essence is an intimate
association of physical sensations with feelings and thoughts,
with the entire spiritual and emotional being of
<span class="nowrap">mankind.<a id="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Love,&#8221; says Charles Albert, &#8220;is the result of all the forward steps
of human activity in all departments, and in every direction, as
manifested in their effects upon the sexual life. It is an advance
which goes hand in hand with all other advances. Man is an inseparable
whole, and in theory only can he be subdivided into separate
faculties. In reality, indeed, all departments of human development
are so intimately associated that progress in any one of them must
place something to the credit of all.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Increasing psychical refinement and differentiation of the
human type, domination of the intelligence and of emotion over
brute force, transformation of the social relations between man
and woman in consequence of economic conditions or of religious
and moral ideas, respect for personality, a secured provision for
the most pressing vital needs, and a consequent elevation and
complication of the sexual life, the influence of a longing for ideal
beauty in a psychical and moral sense&mdash;all these and much more
have contributed to constitute sexual love in the sense in which
we understand and experience it at the present day. The speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
of the lover of our own time is the comprehensive expression of
all human progress. The difference between animal rutting and
the lofty sensation of love corresponds exactly to the gulf which
separates primitive man, capable only of chipping for himself a
few almost useless flint tools, from civilized man who, with the
aid of innumerable machines, has tamed to his service the
elementary forces of Nature.</p>

<p>We must recur to the earliest beginnings of the evolution of the
human psyche in its association with sexuality, in order to
understand the <b>profound</b> and <b>primitive</b> connexion between the
bodily and the spiritual formative impulse; this connexion has
been expressed by the saying that the sexual impulse is the
father of all those intellectual impulses peculiar to man which
have made him a thinker and a discoverer. In the time of
Schelling&#8217;s natural philosophy, they went so far as to speak of
the &#8220;testicular hemispheres&#8221; as analogous to the hemispheres
of the brain. And is not this connexion also expressed etymologically
(in German) in the verbal association of <i>Zeugung</i> (procreation)
and <i>Ueberzeugung</i> (certainty, <i>i.e.</i>, higher, or intellectual,
procreation), and, further, by the fact that in the Hebrew tongue
the ideas of &#8220;procreation&#8221; and &#8220;cognition&#8221; are jointly represented
by a <b>single</b> term? And, returning to the physical
sphere, it may be mentioned that, according to Moebius (&#8220;Ueber
die Wirkungen der Kastration&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Concerning the Effects of
Castration,&#8221; Halle, 1906), sexuality is the common product of
testicular and cerebral activity.</p>

<p>Plato was already aware of this relationship when he called
thought a sublimated sexual impulse, and Buffon likewise when
he described love as &#8220;le premier essor de la sensibilit&eacute;, qui
se porte ensuite &agrave; d&#8217;autres objets.&#8221; In more recent times,
Dr. Santlus, in his valuable essay, &#8220;On the Psychology of the
Human Impulses&#8221; (<i>Archiv f&uuml;r Psychiatrie</i>, 1864, vol. vi.,
pp. 244 and 262), alluded to this combination of the sexual sphere
with the highest spiritual interests of mankind under the name
of the &#8220;function-impulse.&#8221;</p>

<p>From these intimate relations between sexual and spiritual
productivity is to be explained the remarkable fact that certain
spiritual creations may take the place of the purely physical
sexual impulse; that there are psychical <b>sexual equivalents</b> into
which the potential energy of the sexual impulse may be transformed.
Here belong numerous emotions, such as ferocity,
anger, pain, and the productive spiritual activities which find
their vent in poetry, art, and religion&mdash;in short, the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
<b>imaginative life</b> of mankind in the widest sense is able, when the
natural activity of the sexual impulse is inhibited, to find such
sexual equivalents, the importance of which in the evolutionary
history of human love we shall have later to study in further
detail.</p>

<p>Interesting observations regarding this intimate connexion
between the spiritual and the physical procreative impulse are
to be found in the work of a thinker who made no secret of his
intense sensuality, and in whose life and thought sexuality played
a peculiar part&mdash;in the work of Schopenhauer. In his &#8220;New
Paralipomena&#8221; he lays stress on the similarity between the work
of productive genius and the modification of the sexual impulse
peculiar to the human race. In another place in which, as
Frauenst&auml;dt also insists, he is speaking from personal experience,
he writes: &#8220;In the days and hours when the <b>voluptuous</b> impulse
is most powerful, not a dull desire, arising from emptiness and
dullness of the consciousness, but a burning longing, a violent
ardour, <b>precisely then also are the highest powers of the spirit
available, the finest consciousness is prepared for its intensest
activity</b>, although at the moment when the consciousness has given
itself up to desire they are <b>latent</b>; but it needs merely a powerful
effort to turn their direction, and instead of that tormenting, despairing
lust (the kingdom of darkness), the activity of the highest
spiritual powers fills the consciousness (the kingdom of light).&#8221;</p>

<p>Georg Hirth, who, in the section of his &#8220;Ways to Love&#8221;
entitled &#8220;Stark-naked Thoughts,&#8221; gives in aphorisms an interesting
account of the psychology of love, affirms the &#8220;delightful
phenomenon of a peculiarly active enhancement of our impulse
to thought and production,&#8221; <b>after</b> erotic satisfaction, <b>after</b> a
fortunate love-night. Very ably, also, has Mantegazza described
the spiritual activity produced by a happy and victorious
<span class="nowrap">love.<a id="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Many great thinkers have complained of the alleged impairment
of pure spirituality by the sexual life, and have recommended
asceticism in order to arrive at a truer internal enlightenment.
This, however, would imply pulling up the roots of
spiritual <span class="nowrap">poietic<a id="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
activity, the suppression of a rich inner life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
thought and feeling, the destruction of all true poetry and art.
There would be left behind only the wilderness of a cold abstraction.
Look at the letters of Abelard before and after his emasculation.
Sexuality first breathes into our spiritual being the warm
and blooming life.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The world,&#8221; says Philipp Frey, &#8220;would be conceived by us in
sharply bounded intellectual pictures, unless we saw it in the changing
lights of our sexuality. From the green of gently dreaming desire,
through the yellow of surging emotion, and from the blood-red of
eager desire to the cool blue of satisfaction&mdash;all things appear to us in
the light of our sexuality. Life would be better ordered if we were
purely intelligible machines for the purposes of nutrition, work, and
production. But without the dualism of desire and satisfaction, the
world would become torpid in a great yawn.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This intimate connexion between the psychic-emotional being
and the sexual impulse gave rise to a deepening, a concentration,
and an increasing intensity, of the feeling of love, whereby the
latter becomes the most powerful influence affecting mankind in
bodily and spiritual relations. Voltaire, in his &#8220;Pens&eacute;es Philosophiques,&#8221;
says aptly: &#8220;L&#8217;amour est de toutes les passions la
plus forte, parce qu&#8217;elle attaque &agrave; la fois la t&ecirc;te, le c&#339;ur, et le
corps.&#8221; That it is in love that the immediate admixture of
organic processes most clearly manifests itself is a fact pointed
out already by Aristotle, and among modems emphasized by
<span class="nowrap">Griesinger.<a id="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus love discloses itself as a <b>nucleus</b>, the <b>axis</b> of the individual,
and therewith also of the social life, a fact indicated already in
Schopenhauer&#8217;s phrase, describing love as the &#8220;focus of the
will,&#8221; and in Weismann&#8217;s expression &#8220;the continuity of the
germ-plasma.&#8221; And we can easily understand that there are
literary advocates of a consequent &#8220;<b>sexual philosophy</b>,&#8221; who
base their view of the universe solely and entirely upon the
sexual. To them the sexual problem becomes a world problem,
eroticism expands into metaphysics. These sexual philosophers
start from love to unveil the mysteries of life. The most celebrated
advocate of such a sexual philosophy was the Marquis de
Sade, of whom I have myself given an account in a pseudonymous<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
work entitled &#8220;New Researches concerning the Marquis de
Sade&#8221; (Berlin, 1904). According to de Sade, it is only through
the sexual that the world can be grasped and understood.</p>

<p>In a certain sense the antipodes of the Marquis de Sade is a
remarkable sexual philosopher of our own time, the author of
&#8220;Sex and Character,&#8221; Dr. Otto Weininger. His whole circle of
thought also revolves exclusively round the sexual. It forms the
basis, the starting-point of his exposition; though, indeed, it
does so in a purely negative sense. For Weininger is the apostle
of <b>asexuality</b>; to him the highest type of human being is the non-sexual,
the one who renounces all sexuality. And woman, as the
incorporation of sexuality, is to him &#8220;nothingness,&#8221; the
&#8220;radically evil&#8221; which must be annihilated.</p>

<p>A positive sexual philosopher of a nobler kind than these two
anomalous spirits is Max Zeiss, whose book, &#8220;Ragnar&ouml;k, a
Philosophico-Social Study,&#8221; was published at Strasburg in 1904.
He regards work, effort, creation, the strife for material position,
for honour and renown, only as subordinate aims for the attainment
of one aim&mdash;<b>love</b>.</p>

<p>The ever more intimate association of love with the spiritual
life, its increasing depth, the inclusion within its sphere of
influence of all feelings and thoughts, necessarily give rise to a
stronger development of the <b>feeling of individual personality</b>,
which, in contrast with the earlier instinctive impulse, came more
and more to dominate the amatory life. Now love gained at
least an <b>equal</b> importance for the individual that in former conditions
it had for the purposes of reproduction, and therewith
subjectively the reproductive idea was unquestionably thrust
into the background, in comparison with the idea of personal
living, of personal enrichment and development, by means of
love. Hegel says aptly (&#8220;&AElig;sthetics,&#8221; Berlin, 1837, vol. ii.,
p. 186): &#8220;The sorrows of love, these frustrate hopes, the very
state of being in love, the never-ending pains which the lover
actually experiences, this never-ending happiness and joy to
which he looks forward in imagination&mdash;these are matters devoid
of all general interest; <b>they concern only the lover himself</b>.&#8221;
Schleiermacher also insists, in his letters concerning &#8220;Lucinde,&#8221;
on the great importance of love for the spiritual development of
the individual.</p>

<p>The individualization of love has certainly resulted in a great
decline in the predominance of the reproductive idea, of the
subjective sense of race, without it ever being possible for it to
lose its eminent <b>objective</b> significance. Nietzsche, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
declares a &#8220;reproductive impulse&#8221; to be pure
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;mythology;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
and Carpenter, also, in his book, &#8220;Love&#8217;s Coming of Age,&#8221; says
that human love is mainly a desire for complete union, and
only in much less degree a wish for the reproduction of the
race. The profound significance of individual love in the
<b>promotion of civilization</b> is exceedingly well described by him
when he says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Taking union as the main point, we may look upon the idealized
sex-love as a sense of contact pervading the whole mind and body&mdash;while
the sex-organs are a specialization of this faculty of union in
the outermost sphere: union in the bodily sphere giving rise to bodily
generation, the same as union in the mental and emotional spheres
occasions generation of another kind.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Proof of the fact that love, in its purely individual relations, is
also of great importance for human civilization, that it is profoundly
significant for the higher evolution of humanity, <b>in
addition to</b> its importance for the perpetuation of the species&mdash;the
proof of this thesis is very important in view of certain problems
connected with the theory of population and in view of the
practical conclusions deduced from that theory, as, for example,
the doctrine of neo-malthusianism. <b>Love and love&#8217;s embrace
do not exist only for the purposes of the species: they are also of
importance to the ego; they are necessary for the life, the evolution,
and the internal growth of the individual himself.</b></p>

<p>And we must not fail to recognize to what extent the fact that
the individual has gained much from love ultimately reacts also
to the advantage of the species. For the species, as well as for the
individual, the true path of progress lies in the direction of the
individualization of the sexual impulses.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">When we study in detail the gradual permeation of sexuality
with spiritual elements, the gradual development of love, and its
advance towards perfection by means of civilization, we ascertain
that for the love of the modern civilized man there exists a kind
of biogenetic, or rather psychogenetic, fundamental law. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
modern love we encounter all the spiritual elements which were
actively operative in the love of past times; the love of the
civilized man of the present day is an extracted, shortened,
compressed repetition of the entire developmental course of love
from the earliest times to the present day. And the general course
of this development reappears also in the love of the individual.</p>

<p>This course is, to put the matter shortly, from the general to
the individual, from the remote to the proximate. We can
further divide the history of human love into two great epochs.
In the first epoch, love was, above all, a <b>transcendental relationship</b>
of a religio-metaphysical nature. The transcendental
relationships played a more important part than the purely human
and personal. Everywhere an ulterior element played its part.
In the second epoch, love underwent an evolution into a more
<b>personal</b> relationship, in which the human being himself took
foremost place, as compared with any transcendental considerations.
The history of love is, in fact, an illustration of
Compte&#8217;s replacement of the theologico-metaphysical epoch of
mental development by the anthropological. In individual love,
however, there still remain active and demonstrable many
transcendental elements. The oldest spiritual elements of love
continue to form a portion of the content of modern love, and to
play a more or less dominant part in its genesis.</p>

<p>To this primeval and psychical phenomenon belongs, above all,
an intimate association between <b>religious</b> ideas and feelings and
the sexual life. In a certain sense, the history of religion can be
regarded as the history of a peculiar mode of manifestation of
the human sexual impulse, especially in its influence on the
imagination and its products.</p>

<p>Certain modern writers, members of the laity far from learned
in the history of civilization, have considered the Roman Catholic
Church pre-eminently responsible for the appearance of this
sexual element in ritual and dogma. This, however, is grossly
unjust. A <b>scientific</b> study of these relations teaches us that <b>all</b>
religions exhibit to a greater or less degree this sexual admixture,
and if this appears more prominent in the Roman Catholic Church,
it is due, in the first place, to the fact that this religion is nearer
to us in time than many of the religions of antiquity, and, in the
second place, it is explicable on the ground that the Roman
Catholic Church has always displayed greater openness and less
hypocrisy than, for example, the Protestant pietists, who, as
the K&ouml;nigsberg scandal, the Eva van Buttler affair, etc., show,
are no less blameworthy in respect of sexual vagaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span></p>

<p>A really <b>objective</b> basis for an opinion regarding the relations
between religion and sexuality can only be obtained when we
cease to consider these relations as an affair of dogma and of the
confessional, and study them upon the basis to which they
properly belong&mdash;to wit, the <b>anthropological</b>. For these relationships
are peculiar to the genus homo as such. The sexual
element is quite as prominent in the religions of primitive peoples
as in those of modern civilized nations.</p>

<p>Anthropological science has hitherto been occupied more with
the fact than with the explanation of the remarkable relations
between religion and sexuality. There can, however, be no
doubt that these relations arise out of the very nature of mankind.
The various anthropologists and physicians who have
occupied themselves with these problems are in agreement upon
this point: that the connexion between religion and the sexual
life can be explained only on <b>anthropomorphic-animistic</b> grounds&mdash;that
is, by the same kind of ideas which Tylor has proved to
be the foundation of the primitive mental life.</p>

<p>Thus, the great physician and anthropologist Theodor Billroth
doubts the existence of any pure religious perception
entirely free from all sensual elements. In a letter to Hanslick,
dated February 21, 1891, he writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In my opinion, it is nonsensical to speak of a special religious
perception. What we call by this name is either a purely fanciful and
imaginative opinion, which may rise to the intensity of hallucination,
and has for substratum any kind of imaginative product which excites
a yearning in the believing or loving individual&mdash;or else, in fanatics,
it is an actual erotic excitement, like the rhythmical prayer-movements
of the Mohammedans, the dancing of the Dervishes, or the
jumping of the Flagellants. The Church as bridegroom for the nun,
as bride for the monk, has a similar signification. It is, in a certain
sense, the continuation of the service of Isis, and of the festivals of
Aphrodite and Bacchus. Man has always created his gods or his god
in his own image, and prays and sings to him&mdash;that is, properly speaking,
to himself&mdash;in the artistic forms of the period. Since the so-called
divine is always a mere abstraction or personification of one or several
human attributes in the highest conceivable potency, it follows that
human and divine, worldly and religious, cannot really be of differing
natures. Man cannot, in fact, think anything supernatural, nor can
he do anything unnatural, because he never can think or act except
with human attributes.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This explanation coincides with the view of Ludwig Feuerbach,
who has especially insisted on the anthropomorphistic element in
religio-sexual phenomena in his essay &#8220;Concerning Mariolatry.&#8221;</p>

<p>M&#8217;Lennan and Tylor were among the chief discoverers of the
animistic aspect of religio-sexual ideas. In a way analogous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
his attitude towards other phenomena, primitive man assumed
the activity of spirits in explanation of the sexual impulse and
everything associated therewith; and he paid divine worship to
the sexual impulse, as the visible and palpable manifestation of
those spirits.</p>

<p>I myself have more fully described this physiological process
in a somewhat different manner (&#8220;Contributions to the Etiology
of Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221; vol. i., pp. 76, 77), and I quote here
my account of the primitive deification of the sexual.</p>

<p>As something elemental, incredible, supernatural, the sexual
impulse made its appearance in man&#8217;s life at the time of puberty;
by its overwhelming force, by the intensity, spontaneity, and
multiplicity, of the perceptions to which it gave rise, it awakened
feelings which enriched, vivified, and inflamed the imagination
in an unexpected manner. This phenomenon, overwhelming
him with elemental force, filled primitive man with a holy fear.
He ascribed it to a supernatural influence, <b>and this supernatural
influence became associated in his circle of perceptions with those
others which he had previously experienced</b>, and which had
aroused in him the feeling of <b>dependence upon one or several
higher powers</b>, before which he knelt in worship. To what
an extent the <b>metaphysical</b> invaded the whole sexual life of man,
Schopenhauer has clearly shown in his &#8220;Metaphysic of Sexual
Love.&#8221; Religion and sexuality come into the most intimate
association in this perception of the metaphysical and in this
feeling of dependence; hence arise the remarkable relations
between the two, and that easy transition of religious feelings
into sexual feelings which is manifest in all the relations of
life. In both cases the surrender, the renunciation, of the
individual personality is experienced as a pleasurable sensation.
Schopenhauer has described in a classical manner the metaphysical
impulsive force of love striving onward towards the
infinite and the divine, whose analogy with the religious impulse
we cannot fail to recognize.</p>

<p>In his thoughtful book, &#8220;The Vital Laws of Civilization&#8221;
(Halle, 1904, p. 52), Eduard von Mayer has also discussed the
religio-sexual problem. He starts from the idea that man regarded
as higher than himself that which he was unable to
master, and, above all, hunger and love.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The pains of ungratified hunger or love plough deep furrows, into
which falls the seed of voluptuousness, of satisfied hunger, or of the joys
of love. And to primitive man, to whom the entire universe is full
of living beings, hunger and love also appear as <b>divine powers</b>, which
pain and plague him until their will is satisfied.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span></p>

<p>The association of sexuality with religion affects both sexes
equally, although the phenomenon appears more intense in
woman, and is more enduring in her, owing to the greater depth
of her emotional life. The brothers de Goncourt, in their diary,
describe religion as simply a portion of woman&#8217;s sexual life.
Feminine sexual activity thus appears something religious, pious,
holy. And those priests who pretended to &#8220;sanctify&#8221; by their
love the women whom they seduced, were certainly more accurate,
from the <b>physiological</b> point of view, than the Church was in its
condemnation of carnal lust as sin and the work of the devil. In
the middle ages it was a view commonly held in France that
women who had intercourse with priests were in some sort
sanctified thereby. The mistresses of priests were called the
&#8220;consecrated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The identity of religious and sexual perceptions explains the
frequent transformation of one into the other, and the continuous
association between the two. A sexual emotion will often
function vicariously for a religious emotion, in part or wholly.</p>

<p>The unusually interesting history of the complicated and remarkable
religio-sexual phenomena renders clear to us individual
processes of this kind and certain peculiarities of racial
psychology; and thereby we are led to understand the powerful
after-effects of these phenomena in the customs, the morals,
and the conventions of our time, and we are enlightened as to
the r&ocirc;le still played by the religio-sexual factor in the life of
many men even of our own day.</p>

<p>One of the oldest, if not the oldest, of religio-sexual phenomena
is <b>religious prostitution</b>&mdash;the &#8220;lust-sacrifice,&#8221; as Eduard von
Mayer happily expresses it&mdash;since therein the sexual act is
regarded as a sacrifice made to the deity. We have here the
unrestricted offering by a woman of her body to every chance
comer without love, <b>as an act of simple sensuality, and for payment</b>,
and thus we find all the characteristics of what at the
present day we term &#8220;prostitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the researches I have myself previously published
regarding religious prostitution, this may be divided into
two great groups:</p>

<p>1. <b>A single act of prostitution in honour of the deity.</b></p>

<p>2. <b>Permanent religious prostitution.</b></p>

<p>A single act of religious prostitution mostly consists in the
offering of virginity; sometimes also in the single, not repeated,
offering of an already deflowered woman. In the single act of
religious prostitution, the woman either offers herself <b>directly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
the deity</b>, the bodily act of defloration being effected by a divine
physical symbol&mdash;as, for instance, by a penis made of stone,
ivory, or wood&mdash;or by direct intercourse with the statue of the
god; or else the woman gives herself to a <b>human representative</b>
of the deity&mdash;for instance, to the king, to a priest, to a blood-relative
(not seldom to her own father, this being a variety of
religious incest), and sometimes to a passing
<span class="nowrap">stranger.<a id="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the first mode of defloration, by means of a
divine symbol, we have especially full reports from the East
Indies. Here, in the sixteenth century, in the Southern Deccan,
the Portuguese Duarte Barbosa first saw the religious defloration
of girls effected by means of the &#8220;lingam,&#8221; the divine
phallus. Girls aged ten years only were sacrificed to the deity
in this brutal manner. From a later time come the accounts of
Jan Huygen van Linschoten and Gasparo Balbi, regarding the
customs of the inhabitants of Goa. The bride was taken into
the temple, where a penis of iron or ivory was thrust into the
vagina, so that the hymen was destroyed. In other cases, the
girl&#8217;s genitals were brought into contact with the stone penis of
an image of the god, at a shrine eighteen miles distant from
Goa. W. Schultze, in his &#8220;East Indian Journey&#8221; (Amsterdam,
1676, p. 161<i>a</i>), relates:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;By means of this priapus, with the assistance of friends and relatives,
the maiden was deprived of her virginity with force and in a
painful manner; at the same time the bridegroom rejoiced that the
foul and accursed idol had done him this honour, in the hope that as a
result of this sacrifice he would enjoy greater happiness in his marriage.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This process of defloration of Indian virgins by the lingam
idol is confirmed by the reports of John Fryer, Roe, Jeon Moquet,
Abb&eacute; Guyon, D&eacute;meunier, and others.</p>

<p>The god Baal Peor, worshipped by the Moabites and Jews,
seems also to have possessed such a divine power of defloration.
His name, &#8220;Peor,&#8221; &#8220;to open,&#8221; is supposed to relate to
the destruction of the <span class="nowrap">hymen.<a id="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>This relationship is more distinctly expressed in the names of
certain gods of the ancient Romans, such as Dea Perfica, Dea
Pertunda, Mutunus Tutunus, regarding whose functions in
connexion with defloration, shown unquestionably by the etymology
of their names, I have referred to at greater length in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
essay on &#8220;Ancient Roman Medicine&#8221; (published in Puschmann&#8217;s
&#8220;Handbook of the History of Medicine,&#8221; p. 407; Jena, 1902).</p>

<p>For the honour of the sexual divinities, the bride was compelled,
as Augustine, Lactantius, and Arnobius report, to seat
herself upon the &#8220;fascinum&#8221;&mdash;that is, the <i>membrum virile</i> of
the priapus statue&mdash;and in this way, either physically, or at least
symbolically, sacrifice her virginity to the deity. According to the
legend, the conception of Ocrisia was actually effected in this
<span class="nowrap">way!<a id="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the second method by which single acts of religious
prostitution are effected, a representative of the deity exercises
the latter&#8217;s right of defloration. It is a form of religious <i>jus
prim&aelig; noctis</i>, which is given to the king, the priest, the father,
and, above all, to a casual stranger, before the girl becomes the
property of her husband or master. In cases in which the husband
has effected defloration, the deity may be satisfied by the
woman later giving herself once to his representative.</p>

<p>The best-known form of religious prostitution is the Mylittacult
of the Babylonians, the worship of that goddess who, according
to Bachofen, represents the uncontrolled life of Nature in
its fullest creative activity, unchecked by any man-made laws&mdash;the
goddess whose free nature is opposed to the constraining
bonds of marriage. For this reason the goddess, as representative
of the unrestrained nature principle, demands from every girl
a free gift of herself to any man wishing to have intercourse with
her. This demand is made in the name of Mylitta and in the
temple devoted to her. The money paid by the man in return
for his sexual indulgence belongs to the goddess, and is added to
the treasures of the <span class="nowrap">temple.<a id="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Herodotus and Strabo give us additional accounts of this
remarkable service of Mylitta. Women of rank, as well as those
of the lower classes, must allow themselves to be possessed once
by a stranger, and were not permitted to return home until they
had given their tribute to the goddess. Moreover, the woman
might not refuse herself to any stranger, whilst the man, on the
other hand, had a free choice. Thus in this account we find all
the characteristics of &#8220;prostitution&#8221; according to our present
ideas.</p>

<p>This custom was abolished by the Emperor Constantine, as
Eusebius informs us, in his biography of this Emperor. The
accounts of Strabo and of Quintus Curtius show us that it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
persisted from the time of Herodotus to the time of Constantine;
in Cyprus, Ph&#339;nicia, Carthage, Judea, Armenia, and Lokris, the
Mylittacult was <span class="nowrap">diffused.<a id="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The true origin of this cult was a consecration to the deity, a
tribute to the goddess of voluptuousness. Secondarily only,
other elements may have entered into the practice, as, for instance,
the later widely diffused assumption of the uncleanness
and poisonous properties of the blood which was shed in the act
of defloration. At the same time the religious idea of a &#8220;sacrifice&#8221;
may have become associated with the idea of &#8220;self-surrender&#8221;
to an utterly strange and unloved man, so that it is
possible that at the root of this peculiar custom there lay a kind
of masochism on the part of the woman, whilst we cannot fail
to recognize the existence of a sadistic basis in the demeanour
of the betrothed man or husband, surrendering the woman to
a strange man; both of these elements&mdash;sadism and masochism&mdash;having
here a religious signification.</p>

<p>In Eastern Asia, and among many savage races, priests
played the part of representatives of the deity to whom the
defloration of the girls and the newly-married was assigned; for
instance, in the Indian sect of the &#8220;Mah&#257;r&#257;jas,&#8221; founded by
Vallabha, in which &#8220;<b>immorality was elevated to the level of a
divine</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>law</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>These &#8220;great kings&#8221; assumed the part of deities who had an
unlimited right of possession over the wives of the faithful&mdash;above
all, the right of defloration. They proclaimed as the most perfect
mode of honouring the god a complete surrender of the woman
to the spiritual chief of the sect, for purposes of carnal lust&mdash;in
exact imitation of the shepherdesses (&#8220;gopis&#8221;), the mistresses of
the god Krishna. This took place during the pastoral games
&#8220;rasmandali&#8221; in the <span class="nowrap">autumn.<a id="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
In addition, on account of his
activity as deflorator, the priest received a present in the name of
the deity. Abel R&eacute;musat reports in his &#8220;Nouveaux M&eacute;langes
Asiatiques&#8221; (Paris, 1824, vol. i., p. 16 <i>et seq.</i>), following the
account of a Chinese author of the thirteenth century, the peculiar
methods employed in Cambodia for the purpose of religious defloration.
Here the priests of Buddha or the priests of the
Tao religion were carried in sedan-chairs to the girls awaiting
them. Each girl had a candle with a mark on it. The &#8220;tshin-than<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>&#8221;
(= adjustment of posture&mdash;that is, sexual intercourse)
must be finished before the candle had burnt down to this mark!</p>

<p>The medicine-men and wizards among the Caribs of Central
and South America, the &#8220;piaches&#8221; or &#8220;pajes,&#8221; had to effect
the defloration of the young
<span class="nowrap">girls;<a id="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span> whilst among other primitive
peoples this right was assigned to the
<span class="nowrap">chiefs.<a id="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The talented and far-seeing Bachofen, one of the greatest of
our investigators into the history and psychology of civilization,
in his classical works upon &#8220;Matriarchy&#8221; and upon &#8220;The
Legend of Tanaquil,&#8221; has very cleverly pointed out that religious
prostitution in general arises from the primitive <b>opposition</b>
to the individualization of love, instinctively felt by primitive
peoples. In fact, in the religious view of sexual matters more
value is placed upon the act than the person, the individual.
Hence arises the slight esteem&mdash;so strongly opposed to our
modern view&mdash;felt for physical and moral virginity in woman,
which to us (whether rightly or not we will not now discuss)
appears the symbol of feminine individuality. Waitz, Bachofen,
Kulischer, Post, Ploss-Bartels, Rottmann, and other ethnologists,
give additional accounts of the contempt, to us so remarkable,
felt in primitive states for the virgin woman. The tragi-comic
position of our own &#8220;old maids&#8221; is closely connected with this
primeval <span class="nowrap">sentiment.<a id="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The facts we have just given regarding single acts of religious
prostitution will pave the way for the understanding of <b>permanent
temple prostitution</b> as a historical phenomenon.</p>

<p>Sexual self-surrender as a purely sensual act is associated
with religious feeling. Thus in some cases a woman would
experience a combination of ardent sensuality with intense
religious feeling, would devote herself wholly to the service of
the god, and in his name would permanently surrender her
body; whilst in other cases the idea of a divine harem&mdash;in
Indian belief every god has a harem&mdash;would find its earthly
exemplar in temple prostitution, by means of which the deity
would enjoy a number of women through the intermediation of
men; or, finally, this custom would arise out of the primitive
practice, according to which sexual intercourse, regarded as a
religious act, <b>customarily</b> took place in a temple, or in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
consecrated room of a house. In support of this view, we may
quote a significant utterance from Herodotus (chapter lxiv. of
the second book of his &#8220;History&#8221;), who in ethnological matters
had such accurate discrimination. He reports that among the
Egyptians intercourse was strictly forbidden in the temples,
and then says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;For people of all nations, except the Egyptians and the Hellenes,
are accustomed to copulate in holy places, and proceed after intercourse
unwashed into the holy places; and they are of opinion that
men resemble animals, and every one sees beasts and birds copulating
in the temples of the gods, and in the consecrated groves. Now, <b>if this
were displeasing to the gods, the animals would not do it</b>. Men, therefore,
do this, and give this reason for it.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This custom arose, without doubt, from the need for a religious
sentiment, and from the wish to enter into direct communion
with the deity, by remaining in the temple during the sexual act.
When later the divine beings obtained their own consecrated
women in the form of the <b>temple-girls</b>, it was no longer necessary
for a man to take his own wife or some other woman into
the temple, for now communion with the deity could be obtained
by means of intercourse with the temple-girls. In the case of
<b>feminine</b> deities a fourth cause or influence comes into operation
in the production of temple prostitution, inasmuch as the courtesans,
on account of their extreme beauty and their remarkable
intellectual powers, were often regarded as representatives of the
goddess. This explains how it happened that among the Greeks
beautiful hetairae served as models for Praxiteles and Apelles,
when these sculptors were making statues for the temple.</p>

<p>The sacred priests of Venus, the &#8220;kade-girls&#8221; of the Ph&#339;nicians,
and the &#8220;hierodules&#8221; of the Greeks, were the servants
of Aphrodite, and dwelt within the precincts of the temple.
Their number was often very great. Thus in Corinth more than
1,000 female hierodules prostituted themselves in the precincts
of the temple of Aphrodite Porne, and even within the
<span class="nowrap">temple.<a id="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>India, where the primitive phenomena of the amatory life can
best be studied, is also the favourite seat of temple prostitution,
since the religious view of the sexual life is nowhere so prominent
as in the Indian <span class="nowrap">beliefs.<a id="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
The temple girls of India are known as
&#8220;nautch-girls,&#8221; or &#8220;nautch-women.&#8221; Warneck writes regarding
them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Every Hindu temple of any importance possesses an arsenal of
<b>nautch-girls</b>&mdash;that is, dancing-girls&mdash;who, next to the sacrificial
priests, are the most highly respected among the personnel of the
temple. It is not long since these temple-girls (just like the hetairae
of Ancient Greece) were among the only educated women in India.
These <b>priestesses, betrothed to the gods</b> from early childhood, were
under the professional obligation to prostitute themselves to every one
without distinction of caste. This self-surrender is so far from being
regarded as a disgrace that even the most <b>highly placed</b> families regarded
it as an honour to devote their daughters to the service of the
temple. In the Madras Presidency alone there are about 12,000 of
these temple <span class="nowrap">prostitutes.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Shortt gives further interesting details of these temple prostitutes,
who are also known as &#8220;thassee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Religious prostitution is to a certain extent still practised
in Southern Borneo; and in a newspaper published at Amsterdam&mdash;<i>The
German Weekly News of the Netherlands</i>&mdash;the following
account of the practice appears in the issue of July 30, 1907:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In the Dyak country there are to be found in nearly every <i>kampong</i>
(village) individuals known as &#8216;balians&#8217; and &#8216;basirs.&#8217; The balians
are prostitutes who also perform medical services. The basirs are
men who dress in women&#8217;s clothing, and in other respects perform the
same functions as the balians, but not all the basirs act in this way.
Balians and basirs are also commonly employed to perform certain
religious ceremonies, on festal occasions, at marriages, funerals, births,
etc. According to the nature of the festivity, five to fifteen of them
officiate. The president of the balians and basirs goes by the name
of the &#8216;upu&#8217;; usually the oldest and most experienced is chosen for
this office. The upu sits in the middle, with the others to right and
left. At an important festival the upu receives from twenty to thirty
gulden; the others one to fifteen gulden. The further away that a
balian sits from the upu, the smaller is her honorarium; the honorarium
is called &#8216;laluh.&#8217; The principal balians and basirs are known
as &#8216;bawimait maninjan sangjang&#8217;&mdash;that is, &#8216;holy women.&#8217; At the
present time the basirs no longer exercise the immoral portions of their
duties, because the Government inflicts severe penalties if they do
so; moreover, they are not allowed now to appear in public in women&#8217;s
clothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Religion shares with the sexual impulse the unceasing yearning,
the sentiment of everlastingness, the mystic absorption into the
depths of life, the longing for the coalescence of individualities
in an eternally blessed union, free from earthly fetters. Hence the
longing for death felt by lovers and by mystically enraptured
pietists, which has been so wonderfully described by Leopardi.<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
&#8220;The yearning for death felt by lovers is identical with the
yearning for sexual union,&#8221; aptly remarks H. Swoboda, and
he very rightly points out that many a suicide ascribed to &#8220;unfortunate
love&#8221; is rather the result of a happy love.</p>

<p>Among primitive peoples, and in ancient times, <b>religio-erotic
festivals</b> first gave an opportunity for the manifestation of
this religio-sexual mysticism. In this the transition of religious
ecstasy into sexual perceptions is very clearly visible, and in the
sexual orgies in which these religious frenzies often found an
appropriate finale we see the crudest expression of the relationship
between religion and sexuality. In such cases sexual ardour
appears to be equivalent to a <b>prolongation</b> and an <b>increase</b> of
the religious ardour&mdash;fundamentally, radically coincident, as
the natural earthly discharge of an ecstatic tension directed to
the sphere of the remote and the metaphysical.</p>

<p>The fact that such sexual excesses are <b>throughout the world</b>
found in association with religion, that since the very earliest
times they have been connected with the <b>most various forms</b>
of religion, proves once more that the origin of this relationship
is dependent on the very nature of religion as such, and that it
is <b>not in any way</b> due to the individual historic character of any
one belief. It is, moreover, quite uncritical and altogether
without justification for any modern writer to endeavour to
make Roman Catholicism responsible for such an association;
Roman Catholicism as such has as little to do with the
matter as all other beliefs. Religio-sexual phenomena belong
to the everywhere recurring <b>elementary ideas</b> of the human
race (elementary ideas in the sense of Bastian); and the only
way of regarding such phenomena that can be considered scientifically
sound, is from the anthropological and ethnological
standpoint.</p>

<p>This sexual religious mysticism meets us everywhere&mdash;in the
religious festivals of antiquity, the festivals of Isis in Egypt, and
the festivals of imperial Rome, both alike accompanied by the
wildest sexual orgies; in the festivals of Baal Peor, among the Jews,
in the Venus and Adonis festivals of the Ph&#339;nicians, in Cyprus
and Byblos, in the Aphrodisian, the Dionysian, and the Eleusinian
festivals of the Hellenes; in the festival of Flora in Rome,
in which prostitutes ran about naked; in the Roman Bacchanalia;
and in the festival of the <i>bona dea</i>, the wild sexual licence of
which is only too clearly presented to our eyes in the celebrated
account of Juvenal.</p>

<p>In India, the sect of Caitanya, founded in the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
celebrated the maddest religio-sexual orgies. Their ritual consisted
principally of long litanies and hymns, stuffed full with
unbridled eroticism, and followed by wild dances, all leading up
to the sexual culmination, in which &#8220;the love of God&#8221; (<i>bhakti</i>)
was to be made as clearly perceptible as
<span class="nowrap">possible.<a id="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span> Even worse
were the Sakta sects (the name is derived from <i>sakti</i>, force&mdash;that
is, the sensuous manifestation of the god Siva). They gave
themselves up with ardent sensuality to the service of the female
emanations of Siva, all distinctions of caste being ignored, and
wild sensual promiscuity prevailing. Divine service always
preceded the act of sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>Among the Kauchiluas, one of these Sakta sects, each of the
women who took part in these divine services threw a small
ornament into a box kept by the priests. After the termination
of the religious festival, each male member of the congregation
took one of these articles out of the box, whereupon the possessor
of the article must give herself to him in the subsequent
unbridled sexual excesses, even if the two should happen to be
brother and <span class="nowrap">sister.<a id="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Ancient Central and South America were also familiar with wild
outbreaks of a sexual-religious character. In Guatemala, on
the days of the great sacrifices, there occurred sexual orgies of
the worst kind, men having intercourse promiscuously with
mothers, sisters, daughters, children, and concubines; and at
the &#8220;Akhataymita festivals&#8221; of the ancient Peruvians, the
religious observances terminated in a race between completely
nude men and women, in which each man overtaking a woman
immediately had sexual intercourse with
<span class="nowrap">her.<a id="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Sexual mysticism found its way also into Christianity. When
the renowned theologian Usener, in his work &#8220;Mythology,&#8221;
writes in relation to these matters, &#8220;the whole of paganism found
its way into Christianity,&#8221; we must point out that in our view
what &#8220;corrupted&#8221; Christianity was not &#8220;paganism,&#8221; but the
<b>fundamental phenomena of primitive human nature</b>, the primordial
connexion between religion and sexuality, which by a
natural necessity manifested itself in Christianity not less than
in other religions.</p>

<p><b>Thus down to the present day</b> we encounter the most peculiar
manifestations of sexual mysticism in the most diverse Christian
sects, and not merely in Roman Catholicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<p>In the fourth century of our era, the Jewish-Christian sect
of the Saraba&iuml;tes concluded their religious festivals with wild
sexual orgies, which are graphically described by Cassianus. This
sect persisted into the ninth century. The later history of
the Christian sects is full of this religio-sexual element.
Religious and sexual ardour take one another&#8217;s place, pass one
into the other, mutually <b>increase</b> one another. I need merely
allude to certain points familiar in the history of civilization,
and investigated and described by many recent students:
the religio-erotic orgiastic festivals of the Nicolaitans, the
Adamites, the Valesians, the Carpocratians, the Epiphanians, the
Cainites, and the Manich&aelig;ans. Dixon, in his &#8220;Spiritual Wives&#8221;
(2 vols., London, 1868), has described the sexual excesses of recent
Protestant sects, such as the &#8220;Mucker&#8221; of K&ouml;nigsberg, the
&#8220;Erweckten&#8221; (&#8220;the awakened&#8221;), the Foxian spiritualists of
Hydesville, etc. Widely known also is the peculiar association
between sexuality and religion in Mormonism, polygamy being
among the Mormons a religious ordinance.</p>

<p>Not only do Roman Catholicism and Protestantism exhibit
such phenomena, but in the Greek Church also sexual mysticism
gives rise to the most remarkable offshoots. Leroy-Beaulieu
gives an account of the Russian sect of the &#8220;Skakuny,&#8221; or
&#8220;Jumpers,&#8221; who at their nocturnal assemblies throw themselves
into a state of erotic religious ecstasy by hopping and jumping,
like the dancing Dervishes of Islam. When the frenzy reaches a
climax, a shameless, utterly promiscuous union of the sexes
occurs, of which incest is a common
<span class="nowrap">feature.<a id="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite apart from these sectarian peculiarities, religio-sexual
perceptions play a definite part in the ideas of present-day, truly
pious Christians. The idea of a &#8220;unio mystica&#8221; between man
and the Deity manifests itself
<span class="nowrap">everywhere.<a id="FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Albrecht Dieterich, in his learned work, &#8220;A Mithraist Liturgy,&#8221;
contributes valuable material to the history of civilization concerning
these mystical unions. The oldest heathen cults were
familiar with the idea of love unions as a representation of the
union of man with God; and in the New Testament the ideas of
the bridegroom and the marriage feast play a leading part.
Christ is the &#8220;bridegroom&#8221; of the Church, the Church is His
&#8220;bride.&#8221; Pious maidens and nuns are happy to call themselves
the brides of Christ. This ecstatic union has always as its substratum
a sexual imagination. Augustine says: &#8220;Like a bridegroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
Christ leaves His bridal chamber; in the mood of a bridegroom
He bestrides the field of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The literature, the theology, the visions, and the plastic art of
the middle ages abound in embellishments of the mystical
marriage. St. Catherine of Siena and St. Theresa were favourite
objects of this form of art. The baroque artist Bernini, in his
representation of St. Theresa, in the Church Santa Maria della
Vittoria in Rome, has painted a truly modern &#8220;alcove scene,&#8221;
so that a mocking Frenchman, President de Brosses, said,
speaking of this picture, &#8220;Ah, if that is divine love, I know
all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>On October 8, 1900, when Crescentia H&ouml;ss, of Kaufbeuren, was
canonized in the Peterskirche, a picture was exhibited in which
was depicted the mystical union between the new saint and the
Redeemer. To the picture was attached a Latin inscription
signifying, &#8220;Our Lord Jesus Christ presents to the virgin Crescentia,
in the presence of the most holy Mother of God and of
Crescentia&#8217;s guardian angel as groomsman, the marriage ring,
and weds her.&#8221; The novice about to become a nun appears
before the altar dressed as a bride, in order to wed herself eternally
to Christ; and in the life of the common people we find an even
more realistic view is taken of this mystical marriage. A celibate
priesthood appears to the peasant, notwithstanding all the respect
that he has for the clerical vocation, as something strange and
incomprehensible; he regards the &#8220;primiz,&#8221; the first mass of
the newly ordained priest, as a marriage which the most reverend
priest celebrates with the Church, and for this purpose the
Church is represented by a young girl. This is at the present
day still a popular custom in Baden, Bavaria, and the Tyrol. In
this ceremony, which does not lack a poetic aspect&mdash;it is admirably
described by F. P. Piger in the <i>Zeitschrift des Vereins f&uuml;r
Volkskunde</i>, 1899&mdash;the peasants who are present make the
coarsest and most pointed jokes, and as soon as the celebration is
finished, they withdraw, in the company of the &#8220;holy&#8221; bride,
to a public-house, where &#8220;they need not be embarrassed by the
presence of the reverend priest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intimate association between sexuality and religion in
these mystical unions and marriages has been shown by Ludwig
Feuerbach in his treatise, &#8220;Ueber den Marienkultus&#8221; (&#8220;On
Mariolatry&#8221;), Complete Works, Leipzig, 1846, vol. i., pp.
181-199. A very interesting instance of this is also afforded by
the following religious poem, which appears in a poetical devotional
work, at one time very widely diffused among the feminine<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
population of France (&#8220;Les Perles de Saint Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales, ou
les plus belles Pens&eacute;es du Bienheureux sur l&#8217;Amour de Dieu,&#8221;
Paris, 1871):</p>

<p>In addition to religious prostitution and to sexual mysticism,
two other religious manifestations show an intimate relationship
with the sexual life, are, indeed, in part of sexual origin&mdash;namely,
<b>asceticism</b> and the <b>belief in witchcraft</b>.</p>

<p>Neither of these is, as has often been maintained by superficial
writers, peculiar to the Christian faith. As Nietzsche says, Eros
did not poison Christianity alone; asceticism and the belief in
witchcraft are <b>common anthropological conceptions, met with
throughout the history of civilization</b>, and arising from the primitive
ardour of religious perceptions.</p>

<p>To what degree is the high estimation of asceticism&mdash;that is,
the view that earthly and eternal salvation are to be found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
<b>complete sexual abstinence</b>&mdash;associated with the religious sentiment?
Religion is the yearning after an ideal, a belief in a process
of perfectibility. To such a belief the sexual impulse and
everything connected with it must appear as the greatest possible
hindrance to the realization of the ideal, because nowhere else is
the <b>disharmony</b> of existence so plainly manifest as in the sexual
life.</p>

<p>In the fifth chapter of his work on &#8220;The Nature of Man,&#8221;
Metchnikoff has collected all the numerous disharmonies of the
reproductive organs and the reproductive functions, in consequence
of which the modern man, become self-conscious,
suffers so severely. Among these disharmonious phenomena in
social life, Metchnikoff enumerates, <i>inter alia</i>, the troublesome,
painful, and un&aelig;sthetic menstrual h&aelig;morrhage in women, which
all primitive peoples regarded as something unclean and evil;
the pains of childbirth; the asynchronism between puberty
and the general maturity of the organism, the latter occurring
much later than the former, and thus giving rise to temporal
inequalities of development in different parts of the sexual
functions, causing, for example, masturbation actually before the
development of spermatozoa; the long interval that commonly
elapses between the onset of sexual maturity and the conclusion
of marriage; the numerous disharmonious phenomena occurring
in connexion with the decline of reproductive activity at a later
stage of life, when marked specific excitability and sexual sensibility
often persist after the capacity for sexual intercourse has
been lost; and finally the disharmonies in sexual intercourse
between man and woman.</p>

<p>According to Metchnikoff, this disharmony of the sexual life,
from the earliest to the most advanced age, is the source of so
many evils, that almost all religions have harshly judged and
severely condemned the sexual functions, and have recommended
abstinence from coitus as the best means for the harmonious and
ideal regulation of life.</p>

<p>In addition to this, we have to take into consideration the opposition
between spirit and matter, deeply realized already by
primitive man. The sexual, as the most intense and most sensuous
expression of material existence, was opposed to the spiritual, and
was regarded as an unclean element, which must be fought, overcome,
and, when possible, utterly uprooted, in favour of the
spiritual life. In one of the most ancient of mythologies
the first recorded instance of the gratification of sexual desire
resulted in excluding man for ever from &#8220;Paradise&#8221;&mdash;in excluding<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
him, that is to say, from the highest kind of spiritual existence.
The principal psychological characteristic of asceticism is therefore
to be found, not only in the vow of poverty, but, in addition,
and even more, is it found in <b>sexual abstinence</b>, in the battle
against the &#8220;flesh&#8221; (&#8220;caro,&#8221; to the fathers of the early Church,
always denoted the genital organs).</p>

<p>What is, however, the inevitable consequence of this continual
battle with the sexual impulse? Weininger expressed the opinion
(&#8220;Sex and Character,&#8221; p. 469, second edition; Vienna, 1904):
&#8220;The renunciation of sexuality <b>kills</b> only the <b>physical</b> man, and
kills him only in order, for the first time, to ensure the complete
existence of the spiritual man&#8221;; but this is <b>entirely false</b>, and
proceeds from an extremely deficient knowledge of human nature.
For the &#8220;renunciation of sexuality&#8221; is, in truth, the most
unsuitable way of securing a complete existence for the spiritual
man. Just as little will it annihilate the physical man. For he
who wishes to overcome and cast out the sexual impulse
(powerful in every normal man, and at times overwhelming
in its strength) <b>must keep the subject constantly before his
eyes, for ever in his thoughts</b>. Thus it came to pass that the
ascetic was actually more occupied with the subject of the
sexual impulse than is the case with the normal man. This
was favoured all the more by the ascetic&#8217;s voluntary <b>flight from
the world</b>, by his continuous life in solitude&mdash;a life favourable
to the production of hallucinations and visions, and one which
becomes tolerable only by a sort of natural reaction in the form
of a luxuriance of imaginative sensuality. For</p>

<p>This &#8220;inqui&eacute;tude,&#8221; this intensification of the nervous life in
all relations, was especially noticeable in the sexual sphere.
Visions of a sexual character, erotic temptations, mortifications
of the flesh in the form of self-flagellation, self-emasculation and
mutilations of the genital organs, are characteristic <b>ascetic</b>
phenomena. On the other hand, the excessive valuation and
glorification of the pure spiritual led not only to the view that
matter was something in its nature sinful and base, <b>but also led<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
directly to sexual excesses</b>, for many ascetic sects declared that
what happened to the already sinful body was a matter of indifference,
that every contamination of the body was permissible.
Hence is to be explained the remarkable fact of the occurrence
of <b>natural and unnatural unchastity in numerous ascetic
sects</b>.</p>

<p>Sexual mortification and sexual excesses&mdash;these are the two
poles between which the life of the ascetic oscillates, so that we
see in each case a marked sexual intermixture. Asceticism
is, therefore, often merely the means by which sexual enjoyment
is obtained in another form and in a more intense
degree.</p>

<p><b>Asceticism is as old as human religion, and as widely diffused
throughout the entire world.</b> We find individual ascetics among
many savage peoples; ascetic sects, especially among the ancient
and modern civilized races, in Babylon, Syria, Phrygia, Jud&aelig;a,
even in pre-Columbian Mexico, and most developed in India, in
Islam, and in Christianity.</p>

<p>The Indian samkhya-doctrine, demanding increased self-discipline,
&#8220;yoga,&#8221; which was based upon the opposition between
spirit and matter, led to the adoption of asceticism in Buddhism
and in the religion of the Jains, also to the foundation of ascetic
sects, such as the &#8220;Acelakas,&#8221; the &#8220;Ajivakas,&#8221; the &#8220;Suthr&#275;s&#8221;
or &#8220;Pure,&#8221; who, according to Hardy, &#8220;are in their life a disgrace
to their name.&#8221; Yogahood attained its highest development
among Sivaitic sects of the ninth to the sixteenth centuries;
these alternated between uncontrolled satisfaction of the rudest
sexual impulses and asceticism pushed to the point of self-torture.</p>

<p>In Islam it was the sect of the Sufi in which the relation
between sexuality and asceticism was especially manifest; but
before this Christianity had developed asceticism into a formal
system, and had deduced its most extreme consequences. To
the early Christians, only the nutritive impulse appeared natural;
the sexual impulse was debased nature; physical and psychical
emasculation were actually recommended in the New Testament
writings (<i>cf.</i> Matt. xix. 12). Already in the second century of the
Christian era numerous Christians voluntarily castrated themselves,
and in the fourth century the Council of Nic&aelig;a found it
necessary to deal with the prevalence of this ascetic abuse, and
with the predecessors of the modern
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;skopzen.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span></p>

<p>Numerous ascetics and saints withdrew into solitude in order
to attain salvation by castigation of the body. But it is very
noteworthy that they almost all <b>lived and moved exclusively in
the sexual</b>, and that, in the way already explained, they came
to occupy themselves incessantly with all the problems of the
sexual life.</p>

<p>The writings of the saints are full of such references to the <i>vita
sexualis</i>, and are, therefore, a valuable source for the history of
ancient morals. Nothing was so interesting to these ascetics as
the life of prostitutes and the sexual excesses of the impious.
Numerous legends relate the attempts of the saints to induce
prostitutes to abandon their profession, and to turn to a holy life,
and the work of Charles de Bussy, &#8220;Les Courtisanes Saintes,&#8221;
shows the result of these labours. St. Vitalius visited the brothels
every night, to give the women money in order that they might
not sin, and prayed for their conversion.</p>

<p>Thus, in the case of the ascetics, whose thoughts were continually
occupied with sexual matters, the sole result of their
castigation, self-torture, and emasculation, was to lead their
sexual life ever wider astray into morbid and perverse paths.
The monstrous <b>sexual visions</b> of the saints reflect in a typical
manner the incredible violence of the sexual perceptions of the
ascetics. To use the words of Augustine, how far were these
unhappy beings from the &#8220;serene clearness of love,&#8221; how near
were they to the &#8220;obscurity of sensual lust!&#8221; These visions, these
&#8220;false pictures,&#8221; allured the &#8220;sleepers&#8221; to something to which,
indeed, in the awakening state they could not have been misled
(Augustine, &#8220;Confessions,&#8221; x. 30). The forms of beautiful naked
women (with whom, moreover, the ascetics often really lay in bed
in order to test their powers) appeared to them in dreams.
Fetichistic and symbolic vision of an erotic nature pestered them,
and led to the most violent sensual temptations, until in the
sects of the Valesians, the Marcionites, and the Gnostics they
resulted in sexual excesses. Marcion, the founder of the well-known
sect named after him, preached continence, but maintained
that sexual excesses could not hinder salvation, since it was only
the soul that rose again after death! The Gnostics oscillated
between unconditional celibacy and indiscriminate sexual indulgence.
As late as the nineteenth century an ascetic mystic led
the Protestant sect of K&ouml;nigsberg pietists into the grossest
sensual excesses.</p>

<p>From asceticism arose <b>monasticism</b> and the <b>cloistral life</b>, to
which the considerations above given fully apply. The undeniable<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
unchastity of the medieval cloisters, which found its
most characteristic expression in denoting brothels by the name
of &#8220;abbeys,&#8221; and, above all, in popular songs and in folk-tales,
also shows us very clearly the relations between religious asceticism
and the <i>vita sexualis</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of asceticism has not lost its primitive force even at the
present day, and retains it for certain men not under the influence
of the Church. But the character and origin of this <b>modern
asceticism</b> are different. We understand it when we remind ourselves
of the saying of Otto Weininger, this typical adherent of
&#8220;modern&#8221; asceticism, that the man who has the worst opinion of
woman is not the one who has least to do with them, but rather
the one who has had the greatest number of <i>bonnes fortunes</i>
(&#8220;Sex and Character,&#8221; p. 315).</p>

<p>The ascetics of early Christianity first denied sexuality&mdash;for
example, by self-castration, or by flight into solitude&mdash;in order
subsequently to affirm it the more strongly. Our modern
<i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> ascetics, above all, the three most successful literary
apostles of asceticism&mdash;Schopenhauer, Tolstoi, and Weininger&mdash;at
first affirmed their sexuality most intensely, in order subsequently
to deny it in the most fundamental manner. They
studied voluptuousness, not merely in the ideal, but also in
reality. For this reason, also, they have furnished us with more
valuable conclusions regarding its nature and its significance in
the life of individual men than we can obtain from the visions of
the early Christian ascetics. This is true above all of Schopenhauer
and Tolstoi.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer had first to endure in his own person the whole
tragedy of voluptuousness, to experience the elemental force of
the sexual impulse, the &#8220;enmity&#8221; of love (see his own account
given to Challemel-Lacour), before he proceeded to grasp the full
significance of the ascetic idea. His asceticism is intimately
associated with his sensuality, and with the consequences of its
activity. I believe that I have myself recently furnished a
striking proof of this fact by the publication of a hitherto unknown
holograph manuscript of the
<span class="nowrap">philosopher,<a id="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span> by which it is clearly
established that he had suffered from syphilitic infection. In
this connexion we find the explanation of the close relationship
which Schopenhauer himself postulated between the &#8220;wonderful
venereal disease&#8221; and asceticism. From his own utterances<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
regarding syphilis, and, above all, from the fact that he himself
had suffered from the disease, we are able to grasp the significance
that syphilis had in the conception of his ascetic views, which
were developed under the immediate influence of his experiences,
sorrows, and passions; whereas in old age, when the elemental
force of the sexual impulse, and the unhappy consequence of
yielding to it, no longer troubled him, there appeared in his
thought a distinctly happier colouring.</p>

<p>Tolstoi also recognizes without reserve how much he had been
affected by voluptuousness. &#8220;I know,&#8221; he says, &#8220;how lust hides
everything, how it annihilates everything, by which the heart and
the reason are nourished.&#8221; Lack of continence on the part of
men is, in his view, the cause of the stupidity of life. Tolstoi&#8217;s
conception of asceticism is, however, by no means identical with
the early Christian, the Buddhistic, and the Schopenhauerian
asceticism. In the beautiful saying, &#8220;Only with woman can one
lose purity, only with her can one preserve it,&#8221; lies the admission
that <b>absolute</b> chastity is an unattainable ideal, and that man can
reach only a <b>relative asceticism</b>. We should hold fast to this
utterance in Tolstoi&#8217;s teaching, which is in no way systematically
developed, and should ignore his insane doctrine of the
unchastity of married life. Later, during our discussion
of the so-called &#8220;problem of continence,&#8221; we shall return to
this idea of a relative continence, and of the good that lies
therein.</p>

<p>Weininger, whose views are unquestionably strongly pathological,
recurs wholly to the ideas of early Christian asceticism.
According to him, &#8220;coitus in every case contradicts the idea of
humanity&#8221;! Sexuality debases man, reproduction and fertility
are <span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>nauseating</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span>
Man is not free, only because he has originated
in an immoral manner! In woman he denies again and
again the idea of humanity. The renunciation, the conquest of
femininity, it is this that he demands. <b>Since all femininity is
immorality, woman must cease to be woman, and must become</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>man!</b><a id="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Georg Hirth has described Weininger&#8217;s book as &#8220;an unparalleled
crime against <span class="nowrap">humanity.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>
Since, however, Probst, in his
psychiatric study of Weininger, has brought forward evidence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
show that in Weininger&#8217;s book we have to do with the work of
a lunatic, the author of this crime cannot at any rate be held
responsible. It is only to be regretted that so many readers have
been led astray by the presence of isolated thoughtful passages
in the book to take Weininger in earnest as a &#8220;thinker,&#8221; and
even in company with the bizarre August Strindberg to believe
that Weininger has solved &#8220;the most difficult of all problems&#8221;!</p>

<p class="blankbefore2">Very significant and influential even down to the present day
are the relations between religion and sexual sentiments exhibited
in the <b>belief in</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>witchcraft</b>.<a id="FNanchor62"></a><a
href="#Footnote62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>
This belief, extending backwards to
the most remote age, is the principal source of all misogyny and
contempt for women&mdash;of which fact we cannot too often remind
our modern misogynists, in order to make clear to them the
utter stupidity, the primitiveness, and the atavistic character
of their views.</p>

<p>Here, again, we must first show the falsity of the view that the
belief in witches is a specifically Christian experience. To the
diffusion of this error the celebrated work of J. Michelet, &#8220;La
Sorci&egrave;re,&#8221; has especially contributed, for in this book the witch
is represented as a Christian medieval discovery. But the
Christian religion, as such, is as little blameworthy for this belief
as are all the other confessions of faith. <b>The belief in witches,
with its religio-sexual basis, is a primitive general anthropological
phenomenon</b>, a fixture, a part of primitive human history arising
from the primeval relations between religious magic and the
sexual life.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;When we look deeply into the province of psychology,&#8221; says
G. H. von Schubert, &#8220;we not only suspect, but recognize with great
certainty, that there exists a secret combination between the activities
of the animal carnal sexual impulse and the receptivity of human
nature for magical manifestations.</p>

<p>&#8220;We stand here in the depths of the abyss in which the lust of the
flesh becomes inflamed to the lust of hell, and in which the flesh, with
all its indwelling forces of sin and death, celebrated its greatest triumph
over the spirit appointed by God to command the
<span class="nowrap">flesh.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The animism of primitive man, and of savage man at the
present day, sees in all frightful natural phenomena shaking his
innermost being to its foundation the manifestation and action
of demons and sorcerers. The rutting impulse also, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
attracts primitive man to woman, appears to him to be due to the
influence of a demon, <b>and soon woman herself came to seem to
man something uncanny, something magical</b>. Thus, in its origin
the belief in witchcraft arises from the <b>sexual impulse</b>, and
<b>throughout its history sorcery in all its forms remained associated
with the sexual impulse</b>.</p>

<p>This sexual origin of the belief in witches and in magic has been
carefully described by the celebrated ethnologist K. Fr. Ph.
von Martius, on the basis of his observations amongst the indigens
of Central Brazil. &#8220;<b>All sorcery arises from rutting</b>,&#8221; said an old
Indian to him.</p>

<p>Magic propagates itself by means of sexual desire, and, according
to Martius, will predominate among primitive peoples as long as
these <b>remain</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>unchaste</b>.<a id="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span>
Secret arts, voluptuousness, and unnatural
vice are inseparable one from another. This is proved
by the entire history of human civilization and morals. Among
the indigens of Brazil, the &#8220;paj&eacute;&#8221; or &#8220;piache,&#8221; the sorcerer or
medicine-man, plays the same part as the medieval or Christian
witch.</p>

<p>Sorcerers and witches are, above all, experienced in the sexual
province; popular belief always turns first to this subject. The
witches of ancient Rome resemble those of the middle ages in
respect of their evil practices in sexual relations. According to
J. Frank, the word &#8220;hexe&#8221; (witch) is derived from &#8220;hagat&#8221;&mdash;that
is, &#8220;vagabond woman.&#8221; The ascetic view of the middle
ages, formulated principally by men, saw in woman one who
seduced man to sensual, sinful lust, the personification of the
Evil One, the &#8220;janua diaboli,&#8221; and, ultimately, a female demon
and a witch, whose very being is an impersonation of the obscene
and the sexual. The doctrines of Original Sin and of the Immaculate
Conception had unquestionably an important share in this
conception of woman.</p>

<p>The idea of woman as a witch turned almost exclusively on the
sexual, and the witch was for the most part represented as a
&#8220;<b>mistress of the devil</b>&#8221; (<i>cf.</i> W. G. Soldan, &#8220;History of Witch-Trials,&#8221;
pp. 147-159; Stuttgart, 1843), in which sexual perversion
plays the principal part, since, instead of simple sexual intercourse,
the most horrible unnatural vice was assumed to
occur.</p>

<p>Holzinger, in his valuable lecture on the &#8220;Natural History of<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
Witches,&#8221; characterized the spiritual and moral condition
of the time, which brought forth such an idea, in a few apt
words:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Whilst in the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries,
as those well acquainted with the state of morals during this
period can all confirm, a most unbounded freedom was dominant in
sexual relations, the State and the Church were desirous of compelling
the people to keep better order by the use of actual force, and by
religious compulsion. So forced a transformation in so vital a matter
necessarily resulted in a reaction of the worst kind, and forced into
secret channels the impulse which it had attempted to suppress.
This reaction occurred, moreover, with an elemental force. There
resulted widespread sexual violence and seduction, hesitating at
nothing, often insanely daring, in which everywhere the devil was
supposed to help; every one&#8217;s head was turned in this way, the uncontrolled
lust of debauchees found vent in secret bacchanalian associations
and orgies, wherein many, with or without masquerade, played
the part of Satan; shameful deeds were perpetrated by excited women
and by procuresses and prostitutes ready for any kind of immoral
abomination; add to these sexual orgies the most widely diffused web
of a completely developed theory of witchcraft, and the systematic
strengthening by the clergy of the widely prevalent belief in the devil&mdash;all
these things woven in a labyrinthine connexion, made it possible
for thousands upon thousands to be murdered by a disordered justice
and to be sacrificed to delusion.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The study of the witch-trials of the middle ages and of recent
times&mdash;for it is well known that in the seventies of the nineteenth
century (!) such trials still
<span class="nowrap">occurred<a id="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span>&mdash;would without doubt
afford valuable contributions to the doctrine of psychopathia
sexualis, and at the same time would throw a remarkable light
upon the origin of sexual aberrations.</p>

<p>What a large amount of sexual abnormality arises even to-day
from this common, human, obscure, superstitious impulse
dependent upon the intermixture of religious mysticism and
sexual desire, and which in the medieval belief in witches
attained such astonishing development!</p>

<p>As Michelet proved in his great work on &#8220;Sorcery,&#8221; it was
<b>the religious imagination straying into sexual by-paths</b>, which for
the most part animated the belief in witchcraft, and thus led to
the most horrible aberrations, principally of a sadistic nature.</p>

<p>Like superstition, so also the sexual-religious obsession of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
middle ages, still persists in many persons, <b>even at the present
day</b>, and gives rise to sexual anomalies.</p>

<p>Apart from asceticism and the belief in witchcraft, theological
literature offers numerous instances of the relationship between
religion and sexuality.</p>

<p>In an essay published six years
<span class="nowrap">ago,<a id="FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span> I showed the important
part which sexual questions have played in the so-called <b>pastoral
medicine</b>&mdash;that is to say, in those theological writings in which
the individual facts and problems of medicine are studied from
the theological standpoint, and their relation to dogma is determined.
We find here theological casuistry carried to its extreme
limits, in relation to all possible problems of the <i>vita sexualis</i>.
The experiences of the confessional are employed in a remarkable
manner, the religious imagination wandering, in a peculiar combination
of scholasticism and sensuality, in the obscure fields of
human aberration.</p>

<p>The <b>ostensible</b> inducement to the theological consideration of
sexual problems is in part offered by the statements of perverse
individuals in the confessional, and in part by public scandals.
In both cases casuistry endeavours, from the religious standpoint,
to formulate certain normal rules for the judgment of
the various matters relating to the sexual life. This would,
however, have been impossible, had there not existed an
intimate connexion between sexuality and religion.</p>

<p>Only in this way is it possible to explain the origin of the
gigantic <b>literature of sexual casuistry</b> in theology, and especially
in pastoral medicine. A comprehension of these facts has led
certain writers to launch bitter invectives against the system of
which the confessional formed so essential a part. This is a
narrow and prejudiced view, which we mention only to condemn.
There is, however, ample justification for the representations of
<b>physicians</b> and <b>anthropologists</b>, who are able to observe matters
in the great connexion sketched above, and who have recognized
the relations between religion and the sexual life to be something
common to all humanity, not the artificial products of
any particular spiritual tendency. It is precisely the frequent
endeavours of the Catholic Church to overcome the worst outgrowths
in this direction, which teach us, notwithstanding their
failure to eradicate sexual aberrations, that these relationships
depend upon the very nature of religion.</p>

<p>There is not a single sexual problem which has not been discussed<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
in the most subtle manner by the theological
<span class="nowrap">casuists,<a id="FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
so that their writings offer us a most instructive picture of
<b>imaginative activity</b> in the sexual sphere.</p>

<p>The most detailed discussion, verging on the salacious, of the
degree to which sexual contact is permissible, gave rise to the
name &#8220;theologiens mammillaires,&#8221; because some of them&mdash;Benzi,
for example, and Rousselot&mdash;sanctioned &#8220;tatti mammillari&#8221;
(mammillary palpation). This doctrine was condemned
by Pope Benedict XIV., which proves that the Catholic Church
as such has not invariably sanctioned these things.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;Golden Key&#8221; (&#8220;Llave de Oro&#8221;) of Antonio Maria
Claret, the Archbishop of Cuba, in Debreyne&#8217;s &#8220;Moechialogie,&#8221;
in the writings on moral theology of Liguori, Dens, and J. C.
Saettler, in the &#8220;Diaconales,&#8221; widely diffused in France, and in
many similar works, all possible sexual problems which have
come before the confessional, or possibly <b>might</b> come there, have
been thoroughly discussed&mdash;even the most improbable and impossible.
Coitus interruptus, irrigatio vagin&aelig; post coitum, pollutions
(nocturnal seminal emissions), bestiality, necrophilia,
figur&aelig; Veneris (positions in which coitus is effected), procuration,
various kinds of caresses, conjugal onanism, abortion, varieties
of masturbation, p&aelig;derasty, intercourse with a statue (!),
psychical onanism, p&aelig;dication, etc.&mdash;all have been subjected to
a subtle critical theological analysis. In a sense, these writings
are really valuable mines for the study of psychopathia sexualis.
Later we shall have frequently to touch on the religious etiology
of the individual sexual aberrations.</p>

<p>From the preceding discussion it appears quite clearly that the
relations between religion and the <i>vita sexualis</i> are to be regarded
as general anthropological phenomena, and not as peculiarities
arising by chance, the accidental results of beliefs, time, or race.
The modern physician, jurist, and criminal anthropologist must
therefore pay the most careful attention to the religious factor
in the normal and abnormal sexual life of mankind, if he
wishes to arrive at an unprejudiced and undisturbed knowledge
of sexual anomalies. Havelock Ellis has also laid stress on
the leading significance of religious sexual perceptions. He
proved that small oscillations of erotic feelings accompany all<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
religious perceptions, and that in some circumstances the erotic
feelings overwhelm the religious
<span class="nowrap">perceptions.<a id="FNanchor68"></a><a href="#Footnote68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span> We still meet
with sexual excesses under the cloak of religion, as occurred
recently (1905) in Holland, and (1901) in England. In the
English instance young girls were initiated into the most horrible
forms of unchastity in the religious association founded by the
American Horos and his wife, and known by the name of &#8220;Theocratic
<span class="nowrap">Unity.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Friedrich Schlegel, as Rudolf von Gottschall remarks, proclaimed
in his &#8220;Lucinde&#8221; the new evangel of the future, in which
voluptuousness&mdash;as during the time of Astarte&mdash;is to form a part
of religious ritual. The reawakened tendency of our own day
towards romantic modes of perception would certainly seem
to involve the danger of a renewal and strengthening of religio-sexual
ideas.</p>

<p>For as long as the feelings of love carry with them an inexpressible,
overwhelming force, like that of religious perceptions,
the intimate association between religion and sexuality will persist
both in a good and a bad sense. An elderly physician, who
in his interesting book detailed the experiences derived from
forty years of <span class="nowrap">practice,<a id="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>
made very apposite remarks regarding
this religious sexualism. According to him, unbounded piety is
&#8220;often no more than a sexual symptom,&#8221; proceeding from
<b>deprivation of love or satiety of love</b>, the latter reminding us of
the saying &#8220;Young whore, old devotee.&#8221; Moreover, this is
true alike of man and woman. Piety dependent upon deprivation
of love can often be cured by &#8220;castor, cold douches, or a
well-arranged marriage with a robust, energetic man,&#8221; who
drives away for ever the &#8220;heavenly
<span class="nowrap">bridegroom.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The religious perception is a completely <b>general</b> yearning, and
the same is the case with the associated sexual feelings. The
boundless everlasting impulsion which both contain does not
admit of any individualization. For this reason, the religio-sexual
perceptions can play only a subordinate part in the individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
love of the future; they constitute only the first step in
the history of the idealization of the sexual impulse, and of its
spiritualization to form love.</p>

<p>In the romance &#8220;Scipio Cicala,&#8221; by Rehfues, the Neapolitan
abbess calls out &#8220;<b>I love love</b>,&#8221; after she has gone through the
enumeration of all the phases of passionate love towards God.
The modern man, however, says to the woman, and the woman
says to the man, &#8220;<b>I love you</b>&#8221;; the general religious love has
capitulated to the individual love.</p>

<p>This is clearly the direction taken by &#8220;the way of the spirit&#8221;
in love, which we shall now pursue further.</p>

reason we must, as Ploss-Bartels also insists, admit its existence in human beings

For the apt and convenient word <i>poietic</i>, in preference to <i>creative</i> or <i>productive</i>,
I have to thank Mr. H. G. Wells. See his most admirable &#8220;A Modern
Utopia,&#8221; and on p. 265 <i>et seq.</i> his brilliant classification of &#8220;four main classes of
mind&mdash;the Poietic, the Kinetic, the Dull, and the Base.&#8221;... &#8220;The Poietic or
creative class of mental individuality embraces a wide range of types,&#8221; but, he
goes on to say, the two principal varieties of the <i>poietic</i> type are those classified
as <i>artistic</i> and <i>scientific</i> natures respectively. It is the quality by which these
two natures are distinguished from the kinetic and the dull to which Mr. Wells
gives the name of &#8220;poietic,&#8221; and it is precisely this quality whose interconnexion
with the sexual life is insisted on in the text by Dr. Bloch and by the authors
from whom he quotes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

Rudolf Topp speaks of a &#8220;degeneration&#8221; of the &#8220;healthy natural reproductive
impulse&#8221; into the &#8220;sexual impulse.&#8221; In the primeval period of human
history, he maintains, man knew and gratified the reproductive impulse only; the
sexual impulse developed gradually, and in a later stage of the evolutionary
history of mankind, out of the reproductive impulse, and, in fact, is a degeneration
(!) of the latter. In this period we may look for the first beginnings of
functional impotence, on account of the too frequent exercise of the sexual
function. <i>Cf.</i> R. Topp, &#8220;On the Therapeutic Use of Yohimbin &#8216;Riedel&#8217; as an

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="noindent">The first step on the road to the individualization of love was
effected at the very outset of the grey primeval age by the
origination of the sexual <b>sense of shame</b>. Recent researches have
for the first time established the fact that the sense of shame is
not innate in man, but that it is <b>a specific product of civilization</b>&mdash;that
is to say, a mental phenomenon arising in the course of progressive
evolution, and as such is peculiar to man&mdash;present
already, indeed, in the naked man, but, above all, characteristic
of the <b>clothed</b> man. Clothing and the sense of shame have developed
proportionally side by side, and in dependence each on
the other; and originally both subserved the same purpose, to
develop more strongly, and to bring to expression the individual,
personal, peculiar nature of the individual man. They mirror
the first individual activities in the amatory life of primitive
man.</p>

<p>Georg Simmel has recognized very clearly this individualizing
influence of the sense of shame by saying: &#8220;The entire sense of
shame depends upon the self-uplifting of the
<span class="nowrap">individual.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>By means of the recent critical investigations of leading anthropologists
and ethnologists, we have obtained most important
conclusions regarding the erotic sense of shame. Above all
worthy of mention are the clear-sighted investigations of Havelock
Ellis, and these have been supplemented by the researches
of C. H. Stratz, Karl von den Steinen, etc.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis distinguishes an <b>animal</b> and a <b>social</b> factor of
shame. The former is specifically of a sexual nature, and is the
simplest and most primitive element in the sense of shame. It
is unquestionably more strongly developed in woman than in
man; originally, indeed, it was peculiar to the female sex, and
was the expression of the endeavour to protect the genital organs
against the undesired approach of the male. In this form we
may observe the sense of shame in other animals.</p>

<p>The sexual sense of shame of the female animal, declares
Havelock Ellis, is rooted in the sexual periodicity of the female
sex in general, and is an involuntary expression of the organic
fact that the present time is not the time for love. Since this
fact persists throughout the greater part of the life of the females<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
of all animals kept under man&#8217;s control, the expression of this
sense of warding off becomes so much a matter of custom that it
manifests itself also at times when it has ceased to be appropriate.
We see this, for example, in the bitch, which, when on heat,
herself runs up to the dog, but then turns round again and tries
to run away, and finally permits copulation only after the most
delicate approaches on the part of the dog. <b>In this manner the
sense of shame becomes more and more a simple manifestation
of the proximity of the male; it comes to be expected by the male,
and takes its place among his ideas of what is sexually desirable
in the female.</b> Thus the sense of shame would appear to be also
explicable as <b>a psychical secondary sexual character</b>. The
sexual sense of shame of the female, continues Havelock Ellis,
is, therefore, the unavoidable by-product of the naturally aggressive
demeanour of the male being in sexual relations, and of the
naturally repellent demeanour of the female; and this, again, is
founded upon the fact that&mdash;in man and in nearly all the species
allied to him&mdash;the sexual function of the female is periodic,
and must always be treated with circumspection by the other
sex; whereas in the male any care of this kind in regard to
the exercise of his own sexual functions is seldom or never
needed.</p>

<p>Groos very rightly points out that the great biological and
psychological importance of <b>coquetry</b> is dependent upon this protective
nature of the sense of shame, coquetry arising from the
conflict between the sexual instinct and the innate sense of shame.
It is to some extent the turning to account of the sense of shame
for sensual purposes, a seldom failing speculation on the sexual
impulse of the male, and in this sense it is the outcome of a genuine
gynecocratic instinct, which we shall again encounter in our
study of masochism.</p>

<p>Since, then, it is no longer possible to question the data of the
most recent researches, by which we are assured of the existence
of a primitively organic animal basis for the sexual feeling of
shame, it is quite as little open to doubt that the true psychic
individual importance of the feeling of shame arises out of a
second fundamental element of that feeling, out of the <b>social</b>
factor; and this factor also affords an explanation of the origin
of the sense of shame in man. This phenomenal form of the
sense of shame is, moreover, specifically human.</p>

<p>This second social fundamental element of the sense of shame
is <b>the fear of arousing disgust</b>.</p>

<p>In this connexion we must refer to the interesting and<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
thoroughly naturalistic theory of Lombroso regarding the origin of
the sense of shame. Lombroso starts from the observation that in
many prostitutes there exists a kind of remarkable equivalent
of the sense of shame&mdash;namely, the dislike to permit of an inspection
of their genital organs when they are menstruating, or when
for any other reason the organs are not clean. Now, the Romance
term for shame is derived from &#8220;putere,&#8221; which indicates the
origin of the sense of shame from the repugnance to the smell of
decomposing secretions. If we connect with this the fact that
the kiss was originally a smell, Lombroso declares that this
pseudo-shame of prostitutes represents the original, primitive
sense of shame of primeval woman&mdash;that is, the fear of being
disgusting to <span class="nowrap">man.<a id="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>
Sergi also accepts this hypothesis of
Lombroso&#8217;s.</p>

<p>According to Richet&#8217;s studies regarding the origin of disgust,
the genito-anal region, with its secretions and excrements, is
an object of disgust among most primitive races, for which
reason they carefully conceal it even from their own sex,
but more particularly from the other sex. Later, quite
commonly the fear of arousing dislike or disgust plays a prominent
part in the production of the sense of shame. This fear
relates not only to the actual sexual organs, but also to the
buttocks. Among many primitive races the latter alone are
covered.</p>

<p>The idea also of <b>ceremonial</b> uncleanness, aroused especially by
the process of menstruation, and associated with ritual practices,
plays a part in the genesis of the sense of shame.</p>

<p>Incontestably, however, the sense of shame has most intimate
relations with <b>clothing</b>; but clothing is in part only to be referred
to the above-described primary factors of the sense of shame.
In the later course of the development of civilization, however,
clothing has come to play a peculiar independent r&ocirc;le in the further
development of a refined sexual sense of shame.</p>

<p>Karl von den Steinen is led, as the result of his own observations
among the Bak&auml;iri of Central Brazil, to the most remarkable
conclusions.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I find it,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;impossible to believe that the sense of shame,
which is entirely wanting among these naked Indians, can in other
men be a primary sense. I am compelled to believe that this sense
first made its appearance after certain parts of the body had been
covered by clothing, and that the nakedness of women was first<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
concealed from the gaze of others when, perhaps, in very slightly
complicated economic and social conditions, the value of marriageable
girls had increased, in consequence of more active intercourse, as is
now the case among the principal families in Schingu. I am also of
opinion that we make the explanation more difficult than it really is
when we theoretically believe ourselves to possess a greater sense of
shame than we practically
<span class="nowrap">have.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor74"></a><a href="#Footnote74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Thus we find that among the Bak&auml;iri, who go <b>completely naked</b>,
our (sexual) sense of shame is almost completely undeveloped;
more especially, a sense of shame due to disclosure of parts does
not exist, whilst the purely animal, physiological sense of shame
is clearly manifested by these
<span class="nowrap">people.<a id="FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Where nudity is customary, the erotic sense of shame is very
slightly developed. Civilized man also accustoms himself with
incredible quickness to nudity, as if it were an entirely natural
condition.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The feeling of being in the presence of nudity is no longer noticed
after a quarter of an hour, and when those who witness it are intentionally
reminded of it, and are asked whether naked men and women,
fathers, mothers, and children, who are standing about or walking unconcernedly,
should be condemned or regarded with compassion on account
of their shamelessness, the observer only feels inclined to laugh, as at
something quite absurd, or to protest at a preposterous suggestion....
With what rapidity in unfamiliar regions it is possible to become
accustomed to a purely nude environment is most clearly shown by the
fact that I myself, in the night from the 15th to the 16th September,
and again on the following night, dreamed of my German home, and
there in my dream I saw all my acquaintances as completely nude as
the Bak&auml;iri with whom I was sojourning. I myself felt astonished at
this, but my neighbour at table at a dinner-party at which in my dream
I was a guest, a lady of quality, at once bade me compose myself, and
said, &#8216;Now we all go like
<span class="nowrap">this.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The Bak&auml;iri, who go completely naked, have no &#8220;private
parts.&#8221; They jest about these parts verbally and pictorially
with complete indifference. It would be ridiculous for this
reason to regard them as &#8220;indecent.&#8221; The onset of puberty
is celebrated in the case of both sexes by noisy popular festivals,
in which the &#8220;private parts&#8221; receive a demonstrative and
joyful attention. A man who wishes to inform a stranger that
he is the father of one of those present, a woman who wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
to declare herself to be the mother of a child, grasps the genital
organs with an earnest and unconcerned demeanour, intending
by this gesture to indicate that they themselves are the procreators.
The cloth covering the penis of the male, and the
three cornered apron of the female, are not for purposes
of concealment, but are simply intended to protect the
mucous membranes&mdash;as a bandage or an apron in the women,
and in the men as an apparatus for the mechanical treatment
of phimosis.</p>

<p>It is only in jest that such things can be regarded as &#8220;articles
of clothing,&#8221; the principal object of which is to subserve the
sense of shame. Sexual excitement is not concealed by this
simple covering. The red threads of the Trumai, the vari-coloured
cloths of the Bororo, are adornments, by which attention
is attracted to this region rather than
<span class="nowrap">repelled.<a id="FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span> The completely
naked Suy&aacute; women wash their genital organs in the
river in the presence of
<span class="nowrap">Europeans.<a id="FNanchor78"></a><a href="#Footnote78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus among these Caribs of Central Brazil, who are still living
in the stone age, we observe in all their simplicity the results
of complete nudity, and we are able to determine that this nudity
entirely prevents the origination of an erotic sense of shame in
our meaning of the term. The physiological factors of the sense
of shame are not, taken alone, sufficiently strong to lead to the
appearance of this sense in its full strength as a special psychical
phenomenon. It is first in association with clothing that these
physiological factors have any great significance in the production
of the sense of shame.</p>

<p>C. H. Stratz, in a historical and anthropological study regarding
women&#8217;s clothing (Stuttgart, 1900), has compared the data of<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
the more recent ethnological investigations with the facts already
known in the history of civilization and art, and has noticed a
remarkable agreement between the two. According to him, &#8220;the
first original purpose of clothing was, not the covering, but
simply and solely the <b>adornment</b> of the naked
<span class="nowrap">body.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor79"></a><a href="#Footnote79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span> The
naked man feels little or no shame; the clothed man is the first
to feel shame&mdash;<b>he feels it when the customary ornament is lacking</b>.
This is true alike for primitive and for civilized man. For
Stratz very rightly points out that any manifestation of nudity
which is prescribed by fashion&mdash;that is to say, by the then
dominant code of beautification&mdash;is never felt as nudity. On
the contrary, a lady in a high-necked dress amongst the <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i>
ladies of a ballroom, &#8220;would feel deeply ashamed because
her breast was not bare.&#8221;</p>

<p>The history of <b>clothing</b> and of <b>fashion</b>, which is so closely
associated therewith, affords us the most important elements for
the understanding of the sense of shame of modern man, and for
the judgment of its importance and of its natural limitations.
Moreover, clothing has most intimate relations to love as a
psychical phenomenon. &#8220;How great an influence,&#8221; says
Emanuel Herrmann, &#8220;love exercises, in all its stages, upon
clothing, and how clearly, on the other hand, love is expressed by
<span class="nowrap">clothing!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>
Clothing more especially satisfies the general human
need, proved by Hoche and myself to exist, for variety in sexual
relationships, which continually demands new allurements and
new stimuli.</p>

<p>The preliminary stage of clothing, a kind of symbolic clothing
for primitive man, is the <b>staining</b>, <b>painting</b>, and <b>tattooing</b>, of the
skin, regarding which recent ethnological researches, especially
those of <span class="nowrap">Westermarck,<a id="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span>
Joest,<a id="FNanchor82"></a><a href="#Footnote82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and
<span class="nowrap">Marquardt,<a id="FNanchor83"></a><a href="#Footnote83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span> have afforded
us noteworthy conclusions.</p>

<p>It is a fact of great interest that the tendency to painting and
adorning the body existed already in prehistoric times, thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
affording a notable illustration of the truth of Herbert Spencer&#8217;s
opinion that the vanity of uncivilized man was much greater
than that of civilized man. In pal&aelig;olithic dwellings coloured
earths have actually been discovered, and coloured pastes made
by mixing iron rust with reindeer fat, which unquestionably were
employed for the colouring of the human body. Moreover, as
Ludwig Stein remarks, the history of cosmetics, which Lord Bacon,
in his &#8220;Cosmetica,&#8221; dated from the days of Biblical antiquity, can
be traced back with certainty to the man of the ice age, upon
whose individual and moral qualities this fact throws a significant
light. According to Klaatsch, pal&aelig;olithic man was not contented
simply with painting his skin; he also tattooed himself
by means of fine flint <span class="nowrap">knives.<a id="FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Painting and tattooing of the body must, then, be regarded
as a primitive stage of clothing. Ploss-Bartels remarks: &#8220;I
find it impossible to doubt that the original meaning of tattooing
is to be found in the endeavour <b>to cover nakedness</b>&#8221;; and
Joest, the most learned student of tattooing, is of the same
opinion. He writes: &#8220;The less a man clothes himself, the more
he tattoos his skin; and the more he clothes himself, the less he
<span class="nowrap">tattoos.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>We must also regard the coloration of the skin produced by
tattooing as a means of allurement; tattooing was, in fact,
<b>principally</b> carried out for the purpose of sexual allurement
and stimulation. The tattooed man is the more beautiful, the
more worthy object of desire. Even in cases in which painting
and tattooing were originally undertaken for other purposes&mdash;for
instance, with some therapeutic aim, or perhaps to serve as
means of social or political differentiation&mdash;still, these signs
and visible changes in the skin of the body speedily exerted a
powerful influence upon the other sex, and by sexual selection
were converted into sexual <span class="nowrap">lures.<a id="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>This sexual character of tattooing is indicated also by the
fact that amongst numerous savage people of the South Seas,
in the Caroline Islands, in New Guinea, and in the Pelew Islands,
the girls, in order to attract the men, were accustomed to tattoo
<b>exclusively the genital region</b>, and especially the mons Veneris;<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
thus, by tattooing, they made this region markedly apparent.
It is characteristic that Miklucho-Maclay at the first glance
received the impression that the girl tattooed in this manner
wore on the mons Veneris a three-cornered piece of blue cloth,
so closely can tattooing simulate clothing.</p>

<p>The sexual nature of tattooing is also shown by its
association with <b>phallic</b> festivals. In Tahiti there is a very
characteristic legend regarding the sexual origin of
<span class="nowrap">tattooing.<a id="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span>
Among many primitive peoples the first appearance of menstruation
gives the signal for tattooing, and for priapistic festivals.</p>

<p>An important sexual relationship is also manifested by the
<b>colour</b> element of tattooing. It appears that the sense of love
in primitive man is closely connected with the sight of particular
colours. According to Konrad Lange, the sensual voluptuous
value of these colours obtained its peculiar character from the
feeling of love associated with viewing them; and, speaking
generally, we can prove the existence of a certain <b>association
between the love of colour and the sexual impulse</b>. Lange records
an experience of his own youth, that when, about fourteen years
of age, he was glancing at a vari-coloured necktie he had feelings
which were not very different in their nature from sexual desire.
He rightly draws attention to the fact that in primitive man
this association of ideas is especially vivid, for the reason that,
as already stated, the painting of the body is usually first undertaken
at the time of the commencement of
<span class="nowrap">puberty.<a id="FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a significant fact that among modern civilized peoples the
practice of tattooing is generally confined to certain lower classes
of the population, such as sailors, criminals, and prostitutes,
among whom the primitive impulses remain active in a quite
exceptional strength, as Lombroso has more especially shown
in his &#8220;Palimsesti di Carcere,&#8221; and in his works on the criminal
and the prostitute. Very frequently obscene tattooings were
found in such <span class="nowrap">persons.<a id="FNanchor89"></a><a href="#Footnote89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span>
Marro, Lacassagne, Batut, and Rudolf
Bergh, have also studied the tattooings of prostitutes and
criminals, and have observed the same objects and ornaments
in both classes. Salillas in Spain, Drago in the Argentine, Ellis
and Greaves in England, and Tronow in Russia, obtained similar
results. In 12&middot;5 per cent. of the inmates of reformatories in
Brieg, Kurella found that the skin was tattooed. According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
him, cynicism, revenge, cruelty, remorselessness, gloomy or indifferent
fatalism, bestial lewdness, with a dominant tendency to
unnatural vices of every kind, &#8220;constituted the principal psychical
manifestations exhibited by these tattoo-pictures.&#8221;</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;P&aelig;derastic symbols among the men, and tribadistic among the
female prostitutes, are of especially frequent occurrence, and among
these we often find a mackerel sketched on the vulva, denoting the
<i>souteneur</i>; still more perverse sexual representations even French
authors such as Batut have not ventured to reproduce; we see things
which would send the <i>police des m&#339;urs</i> out of their minds. Already
in quite young vagabonds, frequently sons of prostitutes, we see
representations of this <span class="nowrap">kind.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor90"></a><a href="#Footnote90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Not only, however, in criminals and prostitutes, but also in the
non-criminal members of the lowest classes of the population,
we often observe erotic tattooings of the most obscene character,
which, without doubt, serve as sexual lures and stimuli. J. Robinsohn
and Friedrich S. Krauss recently published an interesting
account of these <span class="nowrap">matters.<a id="FNanchor91"></a><a href="#Footnote91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p><b>Cases of Tattooing in Women of the Upper Classes.</b>&mdash;It appears that
the primitive tendency to tattooing as a sexual stimulus and means of
allurement has recently revived in certain circles of the refined sensual
world. Ren&eacute; Schwaebl&eacute;, in his celebrated book based on his own observations
and moral studies, and entitled, &#8220;Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es de Paris&#8221;
(Paris, 1904), gives an account of the increasing diffusion of tattooing
among both men and women of the upper classes of Parisian society,
for which purpose a specialist has opened an <i>atelier</i> in the Rue Blanche,
in Montmartre. Schwaebl&eacute; devotes a special chapter to the
&#8220;<i>tatou&eacute;es</i>&#8221; (pp. 47-57), and describes an assembly of some of these
distinguished libertines in a house in the Rue de la Pompe in Passy.
In one of these ladies, tattooing imitated in a most deceptive manner
a pair of stockings, thus affording a characteristic instance of the
above-mentioned association between tattooing and clothing. Another
woman had inscriptions tattooed on the thighs and hips; in two the
legs were adorned with garlands of vine-leaves, birds were billing
on the abdomen, and on the back were depicted many coloured bouquets
of flowers, with the inscription, &#8220;X. pinxit, after Watteau.&#8221; A marchioness
had her family coat-of-arms depicted between the shoulder blades;
another great lady had had tattooed on her body the maddest<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
and most obscene drawings of a satanistic character! Two unmistakably
homosexual women had a common tattooing&mdash;that is to say, one was
complementary to the other; only when they were side by side had the
picture a meaning. The most remarkable of all the tattooings, however,
was that of the hostess. On her body was the picture of a complete
hunt, the individual scenes of which wound round her body;
it was in the most vivid colours; carriages, packs of hounds and hunters
were all shown. The final goal of the hunt was a fox tattooed in the
genital region.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Tattooing leads on to the consideration of <b>many-coloured
clothing</b>, which is especially common in primitive conditions of
mankind. Such clothing, in such conditions, serves chiefly to
accentuate particular portions of the body, in order to stimulate
the sexual appetite of members of the opposite sex. According
to Moseley, the savage begins by painting and tattooing himself
for the sake of adornment. Then he takes a movable appendage,
which he throws round his body, and on which he places the
ornamentation <b>which he had previously marked on his skin in
a more or less ineradicable manner</b>. Now a greater <b>variation</b> is
rendered possible than was the case with tattooing and painting.
Thus, by means of vari-coloured and bright bands, fringes, girdles,
and aprons, which for the most part are attached in the genital
region, attention is drawn to this part&mdash;and here a <b>contrast of
colours</b> is found extremely effective. The Indians of the Admiralty
Islands have as their only article of clothing a brilliant
white mussel-shell, which exhibits a striking contrast to the dark
colour of their skin. The Areois of Tahiti, a class of privileged
libertines and voluptuous individuals, manifested this character
in public places by wearing a girdle made of
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;ti-leaves.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor92"></a><a href="#Footnote92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The first and most primitive form of clothing was this <b>pubic
ornament</b>, the original purpose of which was adornment, not
concealment. The latter significance it acquired only in proportion
as the genital organs became the object of a superstitious
feeling of fear and respect, and were regarded as the seat
of a dangerous <span class="nowrap">magic.<a id="FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span>
The above-mentioned connexion between
sexuality and magic here made itself apparent. It was necessary
that this wonderful, daimonic region should be concealed, in order
to protect an onlooker from its evil and influence, or, contrariwise,
to protect the genital region from the evil glance of the observer.
Both ideas are ethnologically demonstrable. According to
D&uuml;rkheim, the genital organs, and especially those of women,
were covered in primitive times, in order to prevent the perception<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
of any disagreeable emanations from these regions. Finally,
Waitz, Schurz, and Letourneau propounded the theory that the
jealousy of primitive man was the primary ground of clothing,
and was indirectly also the cause of the sense of shame. This
view is supported by the interesting ethnological fact that in
many races only the married women are clothed, whilst the fully-grown
unmarried girls go completely naked. The married woman
is part of the property of the husband; to the latter, clothing
appears to be a protection against glances at his property&mdash;to
unclothe the wife is a dishonour and a shame. When the idea
of possession was extended to the relationship between the
father and his unmarried daughters, these latter also were
clothed; thus the idea of chastity and the feeling of shame were
<span class="nowrap">developed.<a id="FNanchor94"></a><a href="#Footnote94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>We can, however, adduce numerous considerations in support
of the view that the first covering of the genital organs, in association
with the pubic ornament, did not arise out of the feeling
of shame, but, on the contrary, that it served as a means of
sexual allurement. By all kinds of striking ornaments, such as
cat&#8217;s tails, mussel-shells, or strips of hide, fastened either in front
or behind, every possible attention was attracted to the genital
region or the <span class="nowrap">buttocks.<a id="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span>
Concealment made itself felt as a <b>more
powerful</b> sensual stimulus than nudity. This is an old anthropological
experience which still possesses great significance in our
modern civilized life.</p>

<p>Virey believed that human beings had more intense and
manifold sexual enjoyments than the lower animals, because
these latter see their wives at all times without any kind of
adornment, whereas the half-opened veil with which the human
female conceals or partially discloses her charms increases a
hundredfold the already boundless lust of mankind. &#8220;The less
one sees, the more does imagination
<span class="nowrap">picture.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span> That which
causes a refined and sensual stimulus is not the entirely naked,
but the half-naked or partial nudity. Westermarck remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We have numerous examples of races who generally go about
completely naked, but sometimes employ a covering. In such cases
they always wear the latter in circumstances which make it perfectly
clear that the covering is used simply as a means of allurement.
Thus, Lohmann relates that among the Saliras only prostitutes
wear clothing, and they do this <b>in order to stimulate by means of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
unknown</b>. Barth informs us that among many heathen races in Central
Africa, the married women go entirely naked, whilst the girls ripe for
marriage clothe themselves (in order that they may appear worthy of
desire). The married women of Tipperah wear no more than a short
apron, while the unmarried girls cover the breasts with vari-coloured
cloths with fringed edges. Among the Toungta, the breasts of the
women remain uncovered after the birth of the first child, but the
unmarried women wear a narrow
<span class="nowrap">breast-cloth.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor97"></a><a href="#Footnote97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The significance of clothing and partial clothing as a sexual
stimulus, proved by K. von den Steinen and Stratz to exist
among primitive peoples, can be shown to form an element in
the &#8220;fashion&#8221; of civilized races, which provides the imagination
with entirely new sexual stimuli, by means of the two fundamental
elements of the <b>accentuation</b> and <b>disclosure</b> of certain
parts, and speaks to man of &#8220;hidden joys.&#8221; Moses made use
of this psychical sexual influence of clothing. He wished to
increase the numbers of his small people, and therefore he ordered
the <b>concealment</b> of the feminine charms, &#8220;<b>in order to stimulate
the senses of the male members of his community</b>, and thus
increase the fertility of his
<span class="nowrap">people.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
Nudity, rejected by him as
<b>unsuitable</b>, came in the Christian teaching to be regarded as
&#8220;<b>immoral</b>&#8221;; for such a change in the point of view, we can find
numerous examples in the public life of the present day.</p>

<p>The greatest sensual stimulus is exerted by the <b>half-clothing</b> or
<b>partial disclosure</b> of the body, the so-called <i>retrouss&eacute;</i>&mdash;that is, the
art of bringing about a refined mutual influence between the
charms of clothing and the charms of the
<span class="nowrap">body.<a id="FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span> This plays a
very important part in the origination of the so-called &#8220;clothes
fetichism,&#8221; which we shall describe at greater length when we
come to the consideration of these sexual anomalies.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental forms of clothing, the <b>tropical</b>
(coat and sash) and the <b>arctic</b> (doublet and hose), and these, in
addition to their simple function of protecting in the tropics
from the powerful rays of the sun, and in the northern climates
of protecting from cold, serve also in both sexes as a means of
sexual allurement. The changeful phenomena and phases of
&#8220;fashion in clothing&#8221; afford the most certain proofs of this
fact; they may, in fact, be regarded as the most valuable sexual
psychological documents of the successive epochs of civilization.<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
The celebrated writer on &aelig;sthetics Friedrich Theodor Vischer
has regarded them especially from this point of view in his
original work, distinguished by its pithy style, &#8220;Fashion and
Cynicism: Contributions to the Knowledge of the Forms of
Civilization and of our Moral Ideas&#8221; (Stuttgart, 1888). He
regards &#8220;the rage to excel in man-catching&#8221; as &#8220;the most
powerful of impulses, capable of inflaming to fever-heat the
madness of fashion, with its brainless changes, its furious inclinations,
its raging distortions.&#8221; In a certain sense we may also
speak of some of the fashions of men&#8217;s clothing as an art of
&#8220;woman-catching.&#8221; Still, on the whole, this feature is much
less manifest here than in relation to woman&#8217;s clothing.</p>

<p>Clothing has a sexually stimulating influence in a twofold
manner: either certain parts are especially <b>accentuated</b> and
<b>enlarged</b> by the shape or cut of the clothing and by peculiar
kinds of ornamentation, or else particular portions of the body
are directly <b>denuded</b>. Both of these have a sexual influence.</p>

<p>The accentuation and enlargement of certain parts of the body
by means of clothing takes its origin in man&#8217;s belief that by this
means he really produces certain enlargements of his personality,
<b>as though these portions of clothing were actually a part
of himself</b>. This remarkable theory of clothing, according to
which the latter represents a <b>strengthening of the body</b>, a kind of
outwardly projected emanation of the human personality, a direct
continuation of the body, was first enunciated by the celebrated
philosopher Hermann Lotze. He writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Everywhere when we place a foreign body in connexion with the
surface of our body (for not the hand alone develops this peculiarity),
<b>the consciousness of our personal identity is in a certain sense transmitted
into the ends and outer surface of this foreign body</b>, and
there arise feelings, partly of an enlargement of our personal ego, partly
of a change in form and in extent of movement, now become possible
to us, but naturally foreign to our organs, and partly of an unaccustomed
tension, firmness, or security of our
<span class="nowrap">carriage.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor100"></a><a href="#Footnote100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Naturally the reciprocal influence of one person upon another
is not wanting, and the observer believes that in the clothing
he actually finds the body. Parts that otherwise would not have
attracted attention now appear as important objects. For
example, the tall hat, as a prolongation of the head, seems to
give the latter a certain height and worth. Gustave Flaubert, in
&#8220;Madame Bovary,&#8221; very beautifully describes this remarkable
transition, this identification of clothing with the body:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Beneath her hair, which was drawn upwards towards the top of
the head, the skin of the nape of her neck appeared to have a brownish
tint, which gradually became paler, and lost itself in the shadows of
her clothing. Her dress spread out on either side over the chair on
which she was sitting; it fell in many folds, and spread out on the
floor. When he chanced to touch it with his foot, he immediately drew
the foot back again, <b>as if he had trodden on something living</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The same association of ideas has led to the idea that clothing
&#8220;is, as it were, a complete skin to man,&#8221; as if it must represent
a kind of &#8220;ideal <span class="nowrap">nudity.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
Clothing represents the person, shelters
the nature, the soul. It can, therefore, become the means of
expression of human peculiarities, of individual traits of character.
There exists a &#8220;physiognomy&#8221; of clothing; it is a mirror of the
physical and spiritual <span class="nowrap">being.<a id="FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span>
Very rightly is it asserted, in a
pseudonymous essay on the &#8220;Erotics of Clothing,&#8221; that clothing,
in the course of the many thousand years of the development of
civilization, has taken up into itself so much of the <b>spirit</b> of
mankind that we should find a solution for all the problems of
human civilization if we were able completely and immediately
to understand the spirit of clothing. The form of clothing is at the
same time also the most subtle and accurate measuring apparatus
for the peculiar and personal in a man&mdash;for the individual in
<span class="nowrap">him.<a id="FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>If the accentuation of certain parts is the first sexual stimulus
of clothing the denuding of certain parts is the second. When
once the custom of concealing the body has been introduced, the
denuding of portions of the body has acquired a sexually stimulating
effect which it did not previously possess, and which it
does not now possess among primitive communities. In the
saying of a thoughtful writer, that there is a great difference
from an erotic point of view between a glance at the naked leg
of a sturdy peasant girl and a glance at the naked leg of a fashionable
young lady, this different conception of nudity finds very
clear expression. There is, in fact, a natural, sexually indifferent
nudity, and an artificial, erotically stimulating nudity. It is
the latter only which plays a part in the history of clothing and
of fashion; and it is this, in association with the erotic accentuation
of certain portions of the body, which has from early times
been cultivated for the allurement of men, and above all by
the world of prostitution and by the half-world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span></p>

<p>This first occurred in classical antiquity, to which, however,
true &#8220;fashion&#8221; was unknown, because clothing was not then,
as it is in modern times, fused with the body, and therefore did
not appear to be a continuation and representation of the bodily
personality. In general, the refined quality of the modern
&#8220;mode&#8221; was lacking, in regard to the accentuation of particular
parts of the body by means of clothing. Very aptly has Schopenhauer,
in the second volume of his &#8220;Parerga and Paralipomena,&#8221;
pointed out the thorough-going difference between antique and
modern clothing in this relationship. In the days of antiquity
clothing was still a whole, which remained distinct from the
body, and which allowed the human form to be recognized as
distinctly as possible in all its parts. Sexual stimulation could be
effected only by the employment of <b>diaphanous</b> fabrics, which
were preferred in the circles of the half-world and by effeminate
men. Varro, Juvenal, and Seneca chastise with biting words
this immorality of &#8220;coac&aelig; vestes,&#8221; and of the network clothing
imported from Egypt. Then there appeared for the first time
as a peculiar type the woman in man&#8217;s clothing, a proof of the
wide diffusion of the love of boys, on which those prostitutes
who went about clothed as men must have speculated when they
assumed this dress.</p>

<p>The analysis of clothing into <b>upper-clothing</b> and <b>under-clothing</b>
signifies a differentiation of clothing very effective as regards
erotic influence. For the first time could the individual portions
of the body appear in definite significance in relation to the body
as a whole. And the indication of the waist became characteristic
of fashion in <span class="nowrap">clothing.<a id="FNanchor104"></a><a href="#Footnote104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The analysis of clothing was carried a stage further in the
separation of clothing, properly speaking, from that which lies
beneath it, the more intimate covering of the body, the washable
underclothing&mdash;shirt, chemise, petticoat, etc. More
especially had this differentiation a great erotic significance. It
was the increase in the number of individual articles of
clothing which first gave rise to the erotically tinged idea
of the gradual &#8220;dressing&#8221; and &#8220;undressing,&#8221; to the idea
of the intimate &#8220;toilet.&#8221; The possibilities of disclosure,
half concealment, and semi-nudity were notably increased, and
a much larger playground was opened to the erotic imagination.</p>

<p>In association with this, the waist, especially in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
woman, indicated a separation of the bodily spheres into an upper
sphere, associated chiefly with the intellectual, and a lower sphere,
belonging rather to the purely sexual.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The waist, which is already, roughly speaking, indicated by the
sash or girdle, but which, in consequence of the progressive differentiation
of feminine clothing, comes to play a principal part in
women&#8217;s dress, divides the woman&#8217;s body into thorax and abdomen.
The fully clothed woman becomes an insect, a wasp, with two sharply
defined emotional and sexual spheres, with a heavenly and an earthly
<span class="nowrap">division.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>With this classification and differentiation of clothing there
now developed a fertile field for the activity of &#8220;fashion,&#8221; which
therefore, as such, first really takes its rise in the middle ages.
According to <span class="nowrap">Sombart,<a id="FNanchor106"></a><a href="#Footnote106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>
it was in the Italian States of the fifteenth
century that it first became a living reality. Fashion is a product
of the Christian middle ages; the specific element that this
period introduced into feminine clothing&mdash;the corset&mdash;is a witness
to Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>Stratz remarks on this subject:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Strange as it may seem, it is very remarkably true that <b>the corset
derives its origin from the Christian worship of God</b>. Owing to the
strict ecclesiastical control in the middle ages&mdash;strict, at least, as
regards public life&mdash;the dominant ascetic point of view demanded
the fullest possible covering of the feminine body, and the <b>mortification
of the flesh</b>; it insisted, at any rate, that those portions of the body
should be withdrawn from the view of sinful man which are regarded
as especially characteristic of the female sex. Through woman sin
had entered the world, and therefore woman must, above all, take
care to conceal as much as possible the sinful characteristics of her
baser sex. Whilst man, by the greatest possible increase in breadth
of shoulders and chest, endeavoured to suggest a more powerful and
warlike aspect, we find that among women from the twelfth to the
sixteenth century, the endeavour was dominant to make the breasts
as flat and childlike and as narrow as possible, and for this purpose,
<b>for the compression and obliteration of the breasts, an early form of
the corset was</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>employed</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is characteristic that fashion later employed the corset in
precisely the <b>opposite</b> sense&mdash;namely, in order to make the
breasts &#8220;stand out more prominently above the upper margin
of the corset, which continually became shorter.&#8221; Thus there
arose a conflict between medieval fashion and the ascetic tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
of the times. Fashion was victorious along the whole
line, as we can learn in detail in Ritter&#8217;s interesting essay regarding
the nudities of the middle <span class="nowrap">ages.<a id="FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the middle ages, two portions of the body have in the
female sex been especially accentuated by clothing&mdash;the breasts,
and the region of the hips and the buttocks.</p>

<p>As we have already pointed out, the corset was especially
employed to accentuate the breasts, the corset having already
produced the stimulating contrast between the prominence of
the breast and the slenderness of the waist, increased by lacing.
At the same time, at an early date the denuding of the upper part
of the breasts was associated with this accentuation, the top of
the dress being cut away in front <i>&agrave; la grand&#8217; gorge</i>, whilst the
corset, strengthened by rods of whalebone or steel, produced a
<i>bonne conch&eacute;</i>. This accentuation of the breasts dominated feminine
fashion down to the present day. Besides the use of the
corset in this matter, the region of the breasts was also rendered
more prominent by the use of artificial breasts made of wax, by
ornaments in the form of breast-rings, etc.</p>

<p>The partial denuding of the breasts represents the true <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>
of our balls and parties, a custom which a man so tolerant in other
respects as H. Bahr condemns on &aelig;sthetic
<span class="nowrap">grounds.<a id="FNanchor109"></a><a href="#Footnote109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The art of undressing and enjoying <b>in imagination</b> beautiful girls
and women,&#8221; says Georg Hirth, &#8220;is learnt chiefly at Court and other
balls, at which the feminine guests are compelled by fashion to bare
the upper part of the body. It is astonishing how quickly, how
invariably, the girls of the upper classes accustom themselves to this
exhibition, which exercises so stimulating an effect upon us of the
opposite sex. And yet they would turn up their noses if, at the
parties of non-commissioned officers and servants, the women allowed
such extensive glimpses of their charms. I once heard a girl three
years of age express a naive surprise when she saw the <i>d&eacute;colletage</i> of her
mother, who was about to go to a ball. What a scolding would the poor
servant-girl get if <i>she</i> were to exhibit her nudity to the children in
such a <span class="nowrap">manner!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Fr. Th. Vischer also severely criticizes this exposure of
feminine nudities <i>coram publico</i>. Moreover, the free enjoyment
of alcohol customary among men at these evening entertainments
is likely to induce a frame of mind in which the charms<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
thus freely displayed before their eyes will receive an attention
<i>not</i> purely &aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>As regards the corset more particularly, it is not only <b>un&aelig;sthetic</b>,
but also <b>unhygienic</b>.</p>

<p>The corset draws in the beautiful outline of the feminine
body in the most disagreeable manner; the wasp waist which it
produces is an ugly exaggeration of the natural condition. The
lady editor of the <i>Documents of Women</i> instituted an inquiry
amongst a number of artists in regard to the corset. One of these,
the architect Leopold Bauer, replied as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Nature has endowed the feminine body with a most beautiful
outline. It is almost incomprehensible that the ideal of beauty
should during so lengthy a period aim at the destruction of this wonderful
and unique perfection. The corset makes an ugly bend in the
vertebral column, it makes the hip shapeless, it suggests an unnatural
and even repulsive development of the breasts, which transforms our
sentiment of the sacred beauty of the human body into the lowest
sexual and perverse impulses. That the corset does <i>not</i> really make
the body appear slender is no longer open to doubt. All the suggested
advantages of the corset are prejudices.... It is only when women&#8217;s
dress is freed from the tyranny of this detestable corset that it will be
able to develop in a free and artistic
<span class="nowrap">manner.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Physicians are unanimous regarding the unhygienic nature of
the corset. The deleterious influence of tight-lacing upon the
form and the activity of the thoracic and abdominal organs
has been thoroughly elucidated by many authors. I need refer
only, among many, to the writings of Hugo
<span class="nowrap">Klein,<a id="FNanchor112"></a><a href="#Footnote112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span>
Menge,<a id="FNanchor113"></a><a href="#Footnote113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and
O. <span class="nowrap">Rosenbach,<a id="FNanchor114"></a><a href="#Footnote114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>
regarding the dangers of the corset. The corset
hinders the sufficient inspiration, which is so necessary for the
adequate activity of the respiratory and circulatory organs, and
herein we find a principal cause of an&aelig;mia (O. Rosenbach); it
exercises the most harmful pressure on the abdominal organs,
especially on the stomach and the liver, and presses them out of
their natural situation, so that it gives rise to a descent of the
kidneys, the liver, and the genital organs. The extremely ugly
&#8220;pendulous belly&#8221; is also dependent on the influence of the
corset. The pressure of the corset also often gives rise to an
atrophy of the mammary glands, and to abnormal changes in
the nipples. Thence ensues, further, a serious hindrance to the
function of lactation, which may indeed be rendered completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
impossible. For this reason, Georg Hirth, in his admirable
essay upon the indispensable character of the maternal breast,
exclaims: &#8220;Away with the
<span class="nowrap">corset!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The dorsal and abdominal muscles also undergo partial atrophy
in consequence of the habitual wearing of the corset, because
this garment to some extent relieves these muscles of their natural
function. An&aelig;mia, gastric and hepatic disorders, and intercostal
neuralgia are also dependent upon this &#8220;most disastrous error
of woman&#8217;s dress,&#8221; as von Krafft-Ebing calls the corset. Menge
has very thoroughly studied the hurtful influence of the corset
on the feminine reproductive organs. He enumerates, as a
result of wearing it, among many evil results, inflammatory
states and enlargement of the ovaries, relaxation of the uterine
muscles, atrophy and excessive proliferation of the uterine
mucous membrane, the onset of the extremely disagreeable
<i>fluor albus</i>, premature termination of pregnancy, displacements
of the uterus (retroflexion, anteversion, prolapse), abnormal
stretching of the entire pelvic floor, retention of urine, constipation,
and nervous troubles of the most varied character. Very
often, also, sterility in woman is causally dependent upon the
constriction and pressure exercised by the corset.</p>

<p>Rightly, therefore, the abandonment of the corset plays a
principal part in the &#8220;reformed dress&#8221; of woman&mdash;a subject to
which we shall later return.</p>

<p>In addition to the accentuation of the breast by the corset
and by other <span class="nowrap">apparatus,<a id="FNanchor116"></a><a href="#Footnote116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
another aim of feminine fashion has been
most persistent in very various forms, namely, the exaggeration
of <b>the hips, or the buttocks, or both</b>&mdash;in fact, of all the visible
parts of the clothed body which are directly related to the sexual
functions of woman; that is to say, there has been a persistent
endeavour to indicate in the most prominent manner, in a way
to stimulate the male, the secondary sexual characters of the
female in this region of the body.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The thoroughly modern women,&#8221; says Heinrich Pudor, &#8220;coquet
at the present day less with their breasts than with their hind-quarters&mdash;for
this reason, because for the most part they have a masculine<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
type (?). It began with the <i>cul de Paris</i>. Nowadays, clothes are cut
in such a way that in the view from the back the gluteal region is
especially prominent. This is how the fashionable wife of a German
officer strikes us at present.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tailor-made&#8217; is the phrase that has for some time been in use in
England. The tailor has made it&mdash;not the milliner. No, the tailor,
who perhaps is at the same time bath-master and masseur.... Certain
species of baboons are distinguished by their brightly coloured and
prominent hind-quarters&mdash;there seems to be no doubt that our modern
ladies in high life have taken these for their example. Or can it be
that they wish to avail themselves of the homosexual inclinations of
their male acquaintances? Beyond question this is so. Here we
find the fundamental ground of the type of clothing of our own day
by which so much attention is drawn to the region of the buttocks.
What is repulsive here is not the homosexuality, but the misuse that
is made of clothing. In fact, that which is most repulsive to a refined
sentiment is this&mdash;that women have their clothes cut as tightly as
possible round the hips, in order that the broad pelvis, which is
especially characteristic of women as a sexual being, shall be as far as
possible visibly <span class="nowrap">isolated.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor117"></a><a href="#Footnote117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Similarly Fr. Th. Vischer has castigated the immorality
of the gross accentuation of kallipygian
<span class="nowrap">charms,<a id="FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span> which in the
eighteenth century was inaugurated by the invention of the so-called
<i>tournure</i> (<i>cul de Paris</i>), against which Mary Wollstonecraft
inveighed so severely. By the tension of the clothing,
not only the buttocks, but also the hips and the thighs,
were rendered grossly apparent. In certain epochs, also, the
feminine abdomen was very markedly indicated by the mode of
dress; for instance, in the middle ages, down to the sixteenth
century, fashion provided women and girls with the insignia of
pregnancy, as is apparent in the pictures of Jan van Eyck (&#8220;The
Lamb,&#8221; &#8220;Eva&#8221;), Hans Memling (&#8220;Eva&#8221;), and Titian (&#8220;The
Beauty of Urbino&#8221;). The fashion of the &#8220;thick abdomen&#8221;
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was only another
variation of the same theme.</p>

<p>In close relation to the variations of fashion we have just
described is the <b>farthingale</b> (<i>montgolfi&egrave;re</i>) or <b>crinoline</b>. It was
first adopted in the sixteenth century by courtesans and prostitutes,
who thus exhibited rounded and provocative forms, wishing
to allure men by these <i>vertugales</i>, which, according to the
<i>bon mot</i> of a Franciscan, expelled <i>vertu</i>, leaving behind only
the <i>gale</i> (syphilis). The aptest remarks regarding the repulsive
and dirty fashion of the crinoline were made by
<span class="nowrap">Schopenhauer.<a id="FNanchor119"></a><a href="#Footnote119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
It seems as if the crinoline, which is well known to have
celebrated its greatest triumph during the period of the Second
Empire in France&mdash;who is not familiar with the characteristic
daguerrotypes of that period?&mdash;has recently endeavoured to
come to life once more, for it appears that attempts have actually
been made towards the rehabilitation of this monstrosity of
clothing.</p>

<p>The physical difference between man and woman is also
beyond question the principal cause of the difference between
masculine and feminine clothing. According to Waldeyer
(Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Congress of Anthropologists at
Kassel, 1895, published in the <i>Journal of the German Society of
Anthropologists</i>, No. 9, p. 76), it is especially the difference
in the length and position of the thigh-bones that is
responsible for the differentiation between masculine and
feminine clothing. In woman, the upper ends of the femora are,
in consequence of the greater width of the pelvis, more widely
separated than in the male; and since in both sexes these bones
are closely approximated at the knees, in women their position
appears more oblique. This, in combination with the comparative
shortness of women&#8217;s thighs, has a manifest influence upon
the gait, especially in running, in which man distinctly excels
woman. In this purely anatomical difference is to be found the
reason why the masculine mode of dress, which makes the lower
extremities very manifest, is not adapted for woman, especially
when in the upright posture. This is an important cause for the
differentiation between masculine and feminine clothing.</p>

<p>A further fundamental difference between the clothing of man
and that of woman is the much greater simplicity and monotony,
on the whole, of masculine clothing. This has, with good reason,
been associated with the greater intellectual differentiation of
man, who, therefore, stands less in need of any peculiar accentuation
of the individual personality by means of clothing. Woman,
who earlier was <b>only</b> a sexual being, utilized clothing in manifold
ways as a means of sexual allurement, as the chief means of
compensation for the life of activity denied her by Nature and
custom, whereas to man, on the whole, the employment of sexual
stimulation by means of clothing was superfluous.</p>

<p>Georg Simmel writes from another point of view. He is of
opinion that woman, in comparison with man, is, on the whole,
the more constant being, but that precisely this constancy,
which expresses the equability and unity of her nature on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
emotional side, demands, on the principle of compensation of
vital tendencies, a more active variability in other less central
provinces; whereas, on the contrary, man, in his very nature less
constant, who is not accustomed to cleave with the same unconditional
concentration of all vital interests to any once experienced
emotional relationship, precisely in consequence of this, stands
less in need of such external variability. Man, as regards
objective phenomena, is, on the whole, more indifferent than
woman, because fundamentally he is the more variable being,
and therefore can more easily dispense with such objective
<span class="nowrap">variability.<a id="FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, down to the beginning of the nineteenth
century there were not wanting, in the fashion of men&#8217;s clothing,
attempts to employ certain parts of dress for the purpose of
sexual stimulation. I refer in this connexion to my earlier
<span class="nowrap">contributions.<a id="FNanchor121"></a><a href="#Footnote121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
Here I shall allude only in passing to the
peculiar and characteristic variations of men&#8217;s clothing in the
form of marked attention drawn to the male genitals by the
breeches-flap (<i>braguettes</i>); to the shoe, <i>&agrave; la poulaine</i>, which
imitated the form of a male penis; to certain effeminate tendencies
in the dress of man which have recurred very often since the days
of the Roman <span class="nowrap">Empire,<a id="FNanchor122"></a><a href="#Footnote122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
which are connected with the wide
diffusion of homosexual tendencies, and which sometimes have
given men&#8217;s dress so variegated a character, have involved such
frequent changes and such occasional nudities, that at these times
it could enter into competition with women&#8217;s clothing. In this
respect, clothing enables us to draw conclusions not merely
regarding the nature of the men who wore it, but also regarding
the character of the time. There exists also the modern dandyhood,
which recalls many peculiarities of earlier times; but, on
the whole, fashion in men&#8217;s clothing tends to simplicity and
sexual indifference. This movement originated in England, and
the English fashion in men&#8217;s clothing has become dominant
throughout the whole world, whereas women&#8217;s clothing now, as
formerly, receives its fashionable stimulus from Paris.</p>

<p>In addition to the indirect relations of clothing with the <i>vita
sexualis</i>, which we have already described, there is a direct
relationship, and this is <b>the effect of certain fabrics upon the
skin</b>, from which certain associations of ideas and certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
abnormal tendencies may arise. Thus, for example, the contact
of woollen stuffs and of furs has a sexually stimulating influence.
Ryan compared their influence with that of
<span class="nowrap">flagellation.<a id="FNanchor123"></a><a href="#Footnote123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span> In
this sense, also, furs and the whip go together&mdash;these two
symbols of &#8220;masochism&#8221;; velvet has a similar effect. The
celebrated author of &#8220;Venus im Pelz,&#8221; Leopold von Sacher-Masoch,
in his well-known romance bearing this name, deals fully
with the sexual significance of furs. According to him, they
exert a peculiar, prickling, physical stimulus, perhaps dependent
upon their being charged with electricity, and upon the warmth
of their atmosphere. A woman in a fur coat is like a &#8220;great
<span class="nowrap">cat,<a id="FNanchor124"></a><a href="#Footnote124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
a powerful electric battery.&#8221; Influences of smell also appear to
be associated herewith. For, in a letter to his wife, Sacher-Masoch
once wrote to tell her what voluptuous pleasure it would
give to him to bathe his face in the warm odour of her
<span class="nowrap">furs.<a id="FNanchor125"></a><a href="#Footnote125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
With the description of the stimulating effect of fur dependent
upon sensations of contact and smell, he associated also the fact
that fur gave woman a dominant, masterful, magical influence.
His &#8220;Venus im Pelz&#8221; is also to him &#8220;one who commands.&#8221;
Titian found for the rosy beauty of his beloved one no more costly
frame than dark fur. It is doubtless the strong contrast-effect
between the delicate charm and the shaggy surroundings that
evokes that remarkable symbolical relationship to longings for
power and cruel despotism. In a thoughtful essay, &#8220;Venus im
Pelz&#8221; (<i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, No. 487, September 25, 1903), the idea
is developed and explained, that the love of woman for
furs results from her inward nature. It is the secret longing
for an increase of her power and influence by means of
<span class="nowrap">contrast.<a id="FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s clothing comprises the covering of the
entire body with the exception of the face&mdash;the idea does not, as
a rule, include the head-covering and the way the hair is dressed.
In a recent work, H. Pudor brings the face into a peculiar <b>sexual
relationship with the clothing</b>. His remarks on this subject, which
contain many valuable observations, notwithstanding the fact
that much of what he says is overdrawn, run as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that the face is a bearer of the sexual sense in
the second and third degree. Not only the mouth or the larynx. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
nose, especially in virtue of the mucous membranes by which odours
are perceived. The eye, in virtue of the magnetic currents, the perception
of light, and the chemical activity of the retina. But even the
cheeks and the ears. Let some one you are fond of whisper something
into your ear&mdash;notice the emotional wave you will feel, and observe
how from the ear there are paths of conduction to the sexual cells [!].
Above all, however, naturally the mouth. We speak of the labia of
the female genital organs, and therewith already we indicate the
relationship to the lips of the mouth. We can, in fact, prove the
existence, not only of a parallelism in the structure of the mouth and
that of the sexual organs, in man just as in woman. We can go even
further: we can regard the sacral region as the forehead, the anal
region as the nose, the pudendal region as the mouth, and the gluteal
region as the cheeks [!].</p>

<p>&#8220;If we regard the sexual differentiation of the features of the face
as established, from this standpoint we gain an interesting light upon
the deeper lying causes of the wearing of clothes. Civilized mankind
conceals the sexual organs of the first degree; the sexual organs of the
third degree&mdash;that is, the features of the face&mdash;are left naked; in fact,
on account of the thorough way in which the parts of the body adjacent
to the face are covered, stress is actually laid upon the nakedness of
the face as bearing sexual organs of the third degree&mdash;now we recognize
the r&ocirc;le played by the hat&mdash;and by means of that which we call
coquetry, we see mirrored in the features the proper sexual organs, or
we have our attention drawn to the sexual organs by means of the
features, and by the latter we are made aware of certain peculiarities
of the former. In this connexion, let us remember certain facial adornments
which serve to limit still more the naked area of the face, and
to clothe a larger portion of that region, such as the locks of hair
covering the ears which the dancer Cl&eacute;o de M&eacute;rode introduced, ringlets
such as were worn in youth by our grandmothers, or the chin-band
drawn across the middle of the chin. Perhaps even other ornaments
of the face (neck-band, ear-rings, and even eyeglasses and lorgnette [!])
also play a certain part in this connexion. Think, above all, of the
stand-up collar and all other varieties of high collar by which the
clothing is carried up as high as the chin. But those parts of the face
which remain naked must now be as naked as possible; for this
reason hairs, unless they belong to the beard as sexual organs of the
second degree, must be removed, and society determinedly insists that
faces shall be
<span class="nowrap">clean-shaven.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The relation of the face to the clothing already makes clear to
us the idea of &#8220;costume&#8221; as an extension of clothing beyond the
mere covering of the body. All which surrounds man, which has
a relation to his appearance, is costume in the widest sense of
the word; thus, sitting-room, workshop, study, dressing-room,
park, library, etc.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We take pains regarding all that we have nearest to us and round
about us, our toilet, because therein we are at home, therein we suffer
and we rejoice. Where we feel ourselves at home, we shall endeavour<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
so to arrange matters that everything is comfortable to us, down to
the furthest manifestations of our existence, so that our sitting-room,
our bedroom, our house and our garden, constitute <b>a prolongation,
an extension of our clothing</b>&#8221; (A.
von <span class="nowrap">Eye).<a id="FNanchor128"></a><a href="#Footnote128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Thus it happens that fashion is concerned, not merely with
clothing, but also with an abundance of customary details of
environment. The arrangement and furnishing of rooms, artistic
objects, bodily exercises, social intercourse, sports, etc., are
subject to the caprices of fashion. On this extended idea of
fashion is based Fr. Th. Vischer&#8217;s definition: &#8220;Fashion is a general
term to denote a complex of temporary current forms of
civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <b>theory</b> of fashion has been elaborated especially by
<span class="nowrap">Sombart<a id="FNanchor129"></a><a href="#Footnote129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
and <span class="nowrap">Simmel.<a id="FNanchor130"></a><a href="#Footnote130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>
In the work of W. <span class="nowrap">Fred,<a id="FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
also, we find
some thoughtful observations.</p>

<p>According to Simmel, fashion fulfils a double task. On the
one hand, it is the imitation of a given example, and thus
satisfies the need for social dependence; it leads the individual
along the path on which all are going. But, on the other
hand, it satisfies also the need for difference, the tendency
to differentiation, to variation, to self-assertion. This fashion
effects by means of frequent changes, and by the fact that first
of all it is always a class fashion. The fashions of the upper
classes are distinguished from those of the lower classes, and are
instantly abandoned when the lower classes adopt them. Thus,
<b>according to Simmel&#8217;s definition, fashion is nothing else than a
peculiar form among many forms of life, by means of which the
tendency towards social equalization is connected with the tendency
towards individual differentiation and variation to constitute
a unitary activity</b>.</p>

<p>In Paris, the centre of fashion, the associated work of these
two tendencies may be studied most accurately and purely.
We can there observe how at first always a portion only of
society adopts the fashion, whilst the commonalty are still only
on the way towards its adoption. If the fashion has become
entirely general, if it is followed without exception, it is already
over, it is no longer &#8220;fashionable,&#8221; because this class difference
has ceased to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;By means of this interplay&mdash;between its tendency to general
diffusion on the one hand, and, on the other, the annihilation of its
significance which this very diffusion brings about&mdash;fashion exercises
the peculiar charm of the border-line, the charm of simultaneous
beginning and ending, the charm of that which is at the same time
new and obsolete&#8221; (Simmel).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In connexion with this fact we find that from the earliest times
the &#8220;<b>demi-monde</b>&#8221; has always given the impulse to new fashions.
Owing to the peculiarly uncertain position occupied by this
class, everything conventional, everything long in use, is detested
by its members; only newness and change are agreeable.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the continuous endeavour to find new, hitherto unheard-of
fashions, in the heedlessness with which precisely that which is opposed
to what has gone before is passionately grasped, there lies an &aelig;sthetic
form of the destructive impulse, which all pariah existences appear to
possess, so long, at any rate, as they are not completely enslaved&#8221;
(Simmel).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>On the other hand, the equalizing tendency of fashion serves
delicate, sensitive natures as a kind of <b>protection</b> of their personality,
as Simmel has shown in a masterly manner. To such
persons fashion plays the part, as it were, of a mask.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Thus it is a delicate shame and shyness, lest by a peculiarity in
outward aspect, some peculiarity of the subjective character might
perhaps be betrayed, that leads many natures to seek with eagerness
the concealing equalization of fashion.... It gives a veil and a protection
to all that lies within, and that thereby becomes more perfectly
free.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>That modern fashion is, for the most part, a child of the nineteenth
century, and is most intimately dependent upon the
nature of capitalism, has been directly proved by W. Sombart.
He indicates as a decisive fact in the process of the formation of
fashion the perception that the participation of the consumer is
thereby reduced to a minimum, that, on the contrary, the
driving force in the creation of modern fashion is the capitalistic
entrepreneur. If, for example, a Parisian cocotte discovers a
new style of dress, or if, as the newspapers recently reported,
the King of England introduces the fashion of a white hat or
white shoes for men, these actions have, according to Sombart, the
character only of intermediate assistance. The true driving agent
for the rapid <b>general</b> diffusion of fashion, and for the frequent
<b>changes of fashion</b>, remains the capitalistic entrepreneur, the
producer, or merchant. Sombart proves this convincingly by
striking examples. This economic aspect of fashion must receive
no less consideration than the psychological.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span></p>

<p>If men&#8217;s clothing, as we have already said, is, in the gross, far
less subject to the dominion of fashion than women&#8217;s clothing,
still recently efforts have been apparent to simplify women&#8217;s
clothing also, to make it independent of the caprices of fashion,
and, above all, to subordinate it to hygienic principles. It is
noteworthy that these efforts proceed more particularly from the
leaders of the modern woman&#8217;s movement, an interesting proof of
the connexion already alluded to between personality and
clothing. The more differentiated and the more inwardly rich
the personality, the simpler and more monotonous is the clothing.
To this extent, therefore, the desire for simplification of feminine
clothing is an entirely logical postulate of the emancipation of
women. But this demand finds a justification also from the
point of view of hygiene. This fact has been discussed especially
by Paul Schultze-Naumburg in his book on &#8220;The Culture of the
Feminine Body as the Basis of Women&#8217;s Clothing&#8221; (Leipzig, 1901).
He insists above all on the <b>complete abandonment of the corset</b>,
and of the &#8220;small waist,&#8221; and on a return of women&#8217;s clothing to
the free, simple outlines of the antique. He makes, also, very
noteworthy observations on the unhygienic footgear of both sexes.</p>

<p>The idea that woman&#8217;s clothing should unconstrainedly
represent the form of her body has been admirably realized in
the different varieties of the so-called &#8220;<b>reformed dress</b>.&#8221; Not
without influence on these deserving attempts has been the
recognition of the distinguished simplicity and hygienic purposefulness
of the Japanese women&#8217;s clothing.</p>

<p>For the present, however, fashion, as of old, remains dominant,
and celebrates annually its triumph in respect of new discoveries
and refinements of the dress of women of the world, employing
for this purpose the familiar means of accentuation and disclosure,
and of coloured and ornamental stimuli. The &#8220;woman&#8217;s movement&#8221;
has as yet had little ostensible and practical influence in
liberating women&#8217;s dress from the all-powerful control of fashion.</p>

<p>Now that we have considered clothing and fashion in their
relations to the sexual life, and have learned to understand how
they combine in action as means of sexual stimulation of a
peculiar nature, we are in a position to grasp the <b>relations between
the sense of shame and nudity</b>, as it presents itself to us as a
<b>problem of modern civilization</b>.</p>

<p>While, as Simmel also maintains, and as we have thoroughly
explained above, clothing, through the intermediation of fashion,
gives rise to shamelessness as a group manifestation, or, as we
are accustomed to say at the present day, seriously impairs the<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
sense of shame in such a manner as would be repelled with
disgust if it were adopted by the personal choice of an isolated
<span class="nowrap">individual,<a id="FNanchor132"></a><a href="#Footnote132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
clothing has, on the other hand, led astray the natural
biological sense of shame, since it is the sole cause of the &#8220;exaggerated
sense of shame&#8221; known as <b>prudery</b>. Prudery recognizes
the existence of <b>clothed</b> human beings only; it will not recognize
the existence of naked man; it refuses to admit the purely
moral-&aelig;sthetic influence of natural nudity&mdash;to prudery this is
something immoral and repulsive.</p>

<p>To prudery alone we must ascribe the fact that we modern
civilized human beings have completely lost the taste for natural
nudity, and also for the natural sense of shame, and thus we show
little understanding of the ennobling, civilizing influence of both.</p>

<p>Natural nudity, the state in which every human being is born
into this world, not artificial nudity, with its lascivious influence
dependent upon clothing, posture, and gesture, is purely an object
of simple contemplation for the human being of normal perceptions,
who sees in the unclothed human body precisely the same
individual natural object as he sees in the bodies of other living
beings. People, in other respects extremely prudish, admit this
when they have the opportunity&mdash;at the present day certainly
very rare&mdash;of seeing completely naked human beings in natural
surroundings, as, for instance, when bathing.</p>

<p>It is only when we introduce <b>intentionally</b> a sensual or, speaking
generally, an artificial influence, that nudity has an effect of
lascivious stimulation. <b>Prudery is, however, nothing more than
such a way of looking at nudity, with concealed lustful feelings.</b>
The talented Schleiermacher already recognized this fact. He
unmasked prudery as a lack of the sense of shame, and very
clearly pointed out the sexual and lascivious element which it
conceals. In his &#8220;Vertrauten Briefen &uuml;ber die Lucinde&#8221;
(edition of K. Gutzkow, Hamburg, 1835, pp. 63-65) we find the
following beautiful passage:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;What, then, shall we think of those who pretend to be in a condition
of quiet thought and activity, and yet are so intolerably sensitive that
as a result of the most trivial and most remote impulse, passion arises
in them, and who believe themselves to be the more fully equipped with
the sense of shame the more readily they find in everything something
worthy of suspicion? They do not really find what they pretend to
find in every occurrence; <b>it is their own crude lust which lies always
on the watch</b>, and springs forward as soon as anything shows itself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
the distance akin to themselves, and which therefore they find it
possible to condemn; and they will quickly seize an opportunity for
blaming anything of which the motives were <b>absolutely blameless</b>.
Ordinarily, indeed, blamelessness appears to them a pretence. Youths
and maidens are represented as knowing nothing as yet of love, but
none the less as full of yearnings which every moment threaten to break
out, and which clutch the slightest opportunity in order to grasp the
forbidden fruit. But this is absurd. True youths and maidens are,
indeed, the ideals of this kind of modesty, <b>but in them it takes another
form</b>. Only that which has no other purpose than to arouse desire
and passion can do them any harm; <b>but why should they not be allowed
to learn love and to understand Nature, both of which they see everywhere
round them</b>? Why should they not, without restraint, understand
and enjoy what is thought and said about these matters, since
in this way so much the less would passion be aroused in them?
<b>Such anxious and limited modesty as is at the present day characteristic
of society is based only upon the consciousness of a great and
widespread perversity, and upon a deep corruption.</b> What will be
the end of all this? If matters were left to themselves, they would
become worse and worse; when we so persistently hunt out that which
in reality is <b>not shameful</b>, we shall at last succeed in finding something
immodest in every circle of ideas; and finally all conversation and all
society must come to an end; we must separate the sexes so that they
may not look at one another; we must introduce monasticism, or even
something more severe. But this is not to be borne, and it will happen
to our society as it happened to our wives when morality confined
them ever more and more strictly, until at last it became improper for
them to show the tips of their fingers&mdash;and then in despair they
suddenly turned round, and they exposed their necks, their shoulders,
and their breasts to the rude winds and to lascivious eyes; or, like the
caterpillars, they cast off their old skin by a predetermined movement.
Thus will it be; when corruption has reached its climax, and the crude
impulses become so dominant <b>that it is no longer possible to keep them
within bounds</b>, all these false appearances will break down of themselves,
and behind them we shall see youthful shamelessness which
has long intimately entwined itself round the body of society, so that
this has become the true skin in which society naturally and easily
moves. Complete corruption and <b>completed culture, by way of which
we return to blamelessness</b>&mdash;both of these make an end of prudery.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Fine words from a theologian! This thoroughly just description
of the nature of prudery and of its dangers should be laid
seriously to heart by our modern theological bigots and moral
fanatics. How truly Schleiermacher has depicted the nature of
prudery is shown by the observations of the alienist J. L. A. Koch,
that it is precisely the women who were formerly prudish and
&#8220;moral&#8221; when they become insane&mdash;for example, in mania&mdash;who
are much more shameless than women who in everyday life had
taken a more natural view of sexual relationships.</p>

<p>The <b>eternal concealment</b> of the most natural things is what
first makes them appear unnatural, first awakens desire, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
otherwise they would have been passed by quietly and harmlessly
without attention. At the present day the natural justifiable
sense of shame has been <b>intensified</b> to an unnatural degree, and
has been falsified to such an extent that this exaggeration of the
sense of shame, this unceasing objective suppression of natural
harmless activities and feelings, has really increased the hidden
desires to an immeasurable degree; it is this, in fact, which heaps
fuel on the fire of fleshly <span class="nowrap">lust.<a id="FNanchor133"></a><a href="#Footnote133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The genuine, natural, biological sense of shame sets bounds to
lust. To this shame we owe the ennobling and spiritualizing of
the crude sexual impulse; it is the preliminary stage to the
individualization of that impulse. It is intimately related to
that voluntary, temporary, and relative continence which has so
great an importance for the individual life. The sense of shame
has civilized the sexual impulse without denying its essential basis.</p>

<p>Complete culture returns to complete innocence. It knows no
fig-leaves; it does not go about, as did recently in the Dresden
Museum a clergyman affected with the psychosis of hyper-prudery,
knocking off the genital organs from naked statues; nor
does it castrate the human spirit, as we find most biographers
do even now in the case of the great men whose lives they describe.
It recognizes the sexual as something noble and natural.</p>

<p>The sense of shame is an inalienable acquirement of civilization;
it is self-respect. But, as Havelock Ellis rightly remarks, in
<b>completely developed</b> human beings self-respect keeps a tight rein
on any excess of the sense of shame. Knowledge and culture give
the death-blow to all false prudery. The cultured man looks the
natural in the face; he recognizes its value and its necessity. To
him the sexual is the indispensable preliminary of life; hence in
its essential nature it is something <b>harmless, wholly comprehensible</b>;
something that must not be underrated, but <b>above all
must not be overrated</b>, as our virtuous hypocrites and fanatics
of prudery invariably overrate it.</p>

<p>The true league against immorality is the league against
prudery. The apostles of the nude do more service to true
morality than the men of the &#8220;Lex-Heinze,&#8221; than those who
hold conferences on morality, than the German Christian League
of Virtue. A natural conception of the nude&mdash;that is the watchword
of the future. This is shown by all the hygienic, &aelig;sthetic,
and ethical endeavours of our time.</p>

Somewhat diverging from these views, Karl von den Steinen (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 174,
178, and 186) is of opinion that man learned first by their use for practical ends
the employment of the articles later utilized for adornment. Above all, in this
connexion, he alludes to tattooing, which originated, he believes, in the practice
of smearing the body with various coloured earths and with different kinds of
clay, these at the same time serving to promote coolness and to afford a protection
against the bites of insects. <i>Cf.</i> also Yrj&ouml; Hirn, &#8220;The Origin of Art&#8221;

The modern fancy for slender, ethereal, Pre-Raphaelite feminine figures is also
to some extent allied with a negative accentuation of the breasts. Heinrich
Pudor with good reason declares that at the present time perhaps the strongest
sexual influence of woman is dependent upon the fact that &#8220;the existence of
the breasts is concealed, and the appearance of the male sex is simulated.&#8221; <i>Cf.</i>
his article, &#8220;Clothing and Sex,&#8221; in <i>Die Gemeinschaft der Eigenen</i>, August number,
1906, p. 22. Still, the sexual stimulating influence of this concealment of the
breasts appears to be of a transient character, and confined to certain circles of
the hyper&aelig;sthetic and the homosexual.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="noindent">The individualization of love is principally a product of recent
times. A talented author, H. T. Finck, has dealt with this fact
in a comprehensive work in two
<span class="nowrap">volumes.<a id="FNanchor134"></a><a href="#Footnote134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span> This individual
love, containing the spiritual elements of all the successive
epochs of civilization, he denotes by the term &#8220;romantic&#8221;
love, whereas we ourselves generally understand by that
term a special variety of the more comprehensive individual
love.</p>

<p>Every one who is interested in the numerous &#8220;overtones&#8221; of
individual love will find in Finck&#8217;s book a rich, though not very
well arranged, supply of material.</p>

<p>Independently of Finck, I shall endeavour in this chapter to
describe very briefly the most <b>important</b> elements and the developmental
phases of modern love.</p>

<p>First, however, let us consider the &#8220;<b>idealization of the senses</b>,&#8221;
this expression being used by Georg Hirth to denote the capacity
of the senses for self-government; for independent feelings of
pleasure and pain; for the development of peculiar imaginations,
ideas, and talents; and for the utilization at will of other sensory
areas and foci of impulse&mdash;indeed, of the entire individual&mdash;for
the purposes of purely sensual self-command. The lower senses,
among which Hirth also reckons the sexual impulse, can only be
idealized in consequence of the centripetal spontaneous activity of
the higher <span class="nowrap">senses.<a id="FNanchor135"></a><a href="#Footnote135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>This artistic idealization of the senses and impulses also plays
an important part in the process of the individualization and
spiritualization of love. The sexual impulse becomes &#8220;the
source of rich joys and imaginative tragedy&#8221; by means of the
&#8220;veil of imagination,&#8221; the &#8220;heaping up of emotions,&#8221; and the
&#8220;helmet of reason&#8221; (Hirth). The libido sexualis also takes part
in the idealization of all the human senses and impulses. This
is the indispensable preliminary and foundation of the transformation
of the sexual impulse into love.</p>

<p>The first important enrichment of the sexual inclinations by
means of a higher spiritual, individual element, which continues
to-day to form a constituent of modern love, is, I consider, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
<b>Platonism</b> of Greek antiquity and of the Italian renascence. It
is a metaphysic of love resting upon the individual, &aelig;sthetic
contemplation of the beloved
<span class="nowrap">personality.<a id="FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span> For that is the true
sense of &#8220;Platonic love.&#8221; It ennobles physical love to the
heavenly Eros, which is nothing else than the idea of <b>beauty</b> in
the highest sense of the word. Kuno Fischer, in his first published
writing, &#8220;Diotima&#8221; (Pforzheim, 1849), has erected a beautiful
monument in honour of this Platonic love. And did not the
immortal Darwin restate the thought of Plato, when he described
beauty as the testimony of love? In Platonism, at any rate, is
to be found the first intimation of a <b>higher</b> individual significance
of love. In Dante&#8217;s Beatrice, in Petrarch&#8217;s Platonic lyrics, this
idea is reillumined after the long night of the middle ages, to
shine forth still more clearly at the time of the renascence in the
new Platonism and in the cult of the beautiful, thus attaining a
much more powerful individual colouring than it had among the
Greeks.</p>

<p>In the sphere of love, as elsewhere, the plastic genius of the
Greeks manifested itself in the form of peaceful &aelig;sthetic contemplation;
romantic individualism, on the other hand, was
foreign to the Greek mind. The latter is a modern sentiment.
Jean Paul, in his &#8220;Vorschule der Aesthetik&#8221; (Hamburg,
1804, vol. i., p. 139), has aptly characterized the difference
between antique and modern sensibility in the words: &#8220;The
plastic sun (of the ancients) illuminates universally, like waking;
the romantic moon (of the moderns) gleams fitfully, like dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>These first traces of <b>romantic-individual</b> love may be detected
already in Christian medievalism, among the troubadours and
the minnesinger. The heartfelt song, &#8220;Thou art mine, I am
thine,&#8221; gives the clearest expression to the individual, purely
personal nature of the love-relations between man and woman,
and discloses also the &#8220;romantic&#8221; sentiment, as in &#8220;Thou art
locked within my heart; lost is the key: now must thou stay there
for ever,&#8221; and discloses the intimate association peculiar to
romanticism between the nature-sense and the feeling of love.
It is the beloved who first fills for us the joy of summer; her love
is like the rose. An enormous range is thus opened to the
subjectivity of this sentiment. The romanticism of the <b>secret</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
element in love is first perceived at this time, and finds perception
in the words:</p>

<p>The age of chivalry now arrives, the epoch of
<span class="nowrap"><b>minne</b><a id="FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span> (<b>love</b>) and
<b>gallantry</b>. What a new and remarkable change in the spiritual
physiognomy of love! This also has left deep traces in the love
of modern civilized man; this period represents an important
stage in the developmental history of individual eroticism.</p>

<p>In the middle ages the honour of the knight and the love of
woman, &#8220;the most beautiful radiance coming down to us from the
life of this wonderful period,&#8221; as Wienberg says, belong together.
Since that time man&#8217;s honour has been associated in a peculiar
manner with woman&#8217;s love.</p>

<p>Boldly but aptly the far-sighted Herder has described the
knightly minne (love) as a reflex of the Gothic. The same
immeasurability of the imagination, the same indescribable
sentiment, constructed the huge cathedral, and disclosed the
unrivalled worth and beauty of the beloved&mdash;created minne and
its outward expression, gallantry.</p>

<p>In deifying supplication, the knightly spirit elevated the
beautiful sex to the heavens, <b>raised woman far above man</b>, and
placed man far beneath woman. The knight sacrificed himself
for the mistress of his heart, subjected himself to her judgment
before the <i>cours d&#8217;amour</i> (courts of love), and in the lists.
He became the <b>slave</b> of love and of the beloved woman; he
wore her fetters, he obeyed her slightest nod, he endured chastisement
and pain for her sake. But was this all reality? Was it
not rather pure imagination? There was, indeed, as Johannes
Scherr says, a worm at the heart of all this romanticism. The
ideal deification of woman did not affect a corresponding elevation
in her true social position; minne was but too often a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
&#8220;pose,&#8221; and was often associated with unbridled sexual licence
in relation to women of lower degrees.</p>

<p>The domination of the imaginative element characterized the
aberrations of minne, debasing itself for the honour of the
beloved. The masochistic element concealed in all love was here
for the first time elevated into a system. We shall return to this
subject in the chapter on &#8220;Masochism.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet there is another side to the matter, and by the spirit
of chivalry there was aroused a nobler view of woman&#8217;s nature.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The cause and the secret of this dominance (of women) is this,
that woman, with her complete, noble womanliness, entered wholly
and fully into life; that she controlled a kingdom which was hers by
right, the world of feeling and emotion, but controlled this kingdom
and no more. As mistress of feeling, as guardian of feeling, she
brought poetry into life; and into art she brought that lofty impetus,
the above-described fanciful ideal or feminine tendency, which, when
observed and perceived, reacts on the emotional mood of the
<span class="nowrap">observer.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor139"></a><a href="#Footnote139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>To this time also belongs the development of the <b>conventional</b>
in the amatory relations of the sexes, which came to be governed
by definite rules; since that time, for example, it has been
regarded as improper and scandalous for an unmarried woman to
remain for any considerable time alone with a man, a view which
has persisted to the present day. The social intercourse of the
sexes was based upon &#8220;<b>gallantry</b>&#8221; or &#8220;courtesy,&#8221; upon a refined
behaviour towards &#8220;ladies,&#8221; regulated by the laws of beauty,
propriety, and social tact. In the sequel there developed out
of this that exaggerated modern gallantry, characterized by little
real delicacy of feeling, because it exhibits an undertone
of contempt which makes woman feel only too clearly that she
is the representative of a &#8220;weaker,&#8221; inferior sex, and is in no way
the possessor of any proper individual, personal value. Intelligent,
eminent women have always protested against this modern
gallantry. Mantegazza, in his &#8220;Physiology of Woman,&#8221; p. 442
(Jena, 1893), ably describes the hypocrisy underlying this evil
form of gallantry.</p>

<p>The first intimation of modern individual love is to be found in
Shakespeare, to whom love was in general, indeed, only a &#8220;superhuman&#8221;
passion, something lying beyond good and evil, which
seized hold of man against his will; but none the less he embodies
in his work the romantic ideal life of his time in feminine
characters possessing the fullest individuality&mdash;as, for example,<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
Ophelia, Miranda, Juliet, Desdemona, Virginia, Imogen, and
Cordelia, whilst in Cleopatra he has described the daimonic-bacchantic
traits of the love of woman. In Juliet, who sees in
&#8220;true love acted simple modesty,&#8221; we observe the passionate
emotion of the primordial natural impulse, and the first awakening
of woman as a personality.</p>

<p>False gallantry, in association with conventional propriety,
both of which were developed to the fullest degree at the Courts
of Louis XIV. and Louis XV., subordinated love to rules, and
was very well compatible with the most frivolous and epicurean
sensual life. And this occurred at the expense of deeply-felt
natural sentiment, the place of which was taken by mere flirtation
and coquetry. Here, also, the contempt of woman clearly
shows itself. Especially in regard to this period, the opinion
has been maintained that the modern Frenchman has never
suspected, understood, recognized the divine in woman&#8217;s nature.
Still, the general truth of this assertion is belied by the amatory
life of the celebrated heroines of the salons, such as Du Deffand,
Lespinasse, Du Chatelet, Quinault, and above all of the celebrated
Ninon de <span class="nowrap">l&#8217;Enclos<a id="FNanchor140"></a><a href="#Footnote140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span>;
and the Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, in his immortal
&#8220;Manon Lescaut,&#8221; proved that even in that period the indestructible
belief in woman persisted, at least as an ideal.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, in France that the higher individual love underwent
a new spiritual enrichment; Rousseau&#8217;s &#8220;Julie&#8221; appeared
on the horizon of Love&#8217;s heaven. And in the background was
disclosed the German &#8220;Werther,&#8221; a book strangely influenced
by that of Rousseau. The <b>nature-sense</b> on the one hand,
<b>sentimentality</b> on the other, are the new elements in the love of
the period of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se and Werther.</p>

<p>In Rousseau&#8217;s &#8220;New H&eacute;lo&iuml;se,&#8221; passionate love and a complete
self-surrender were described without the artificiality, and also
without the coquetry and wantonness, of which the literature
of the time was full. <b>It was love in a grander style</b> than people
were then accustomed to see. For this reason, the book constituted
a turning-point in literature. That love is an earnest
thing, that it can become &#8220;la grande affaire de notre vie,&#8221; has
perhaps never been more deeply and thoroughly depicted than
in the character of &#8220;Julie.&#8221; In maintaining the essential purity of
the love relationship, when the voice of Nature is really expressed
therein, Rousseau speaks of the principal theme of his own life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Is not true love,&#8221; asks Julie, &#8220;the chastest of all bonds?... Is
not love in itself the purest as well as the most magnificent impulse
of our nature? Does it not despise low and crawling souls, in order
to inspire only grand and strong souls? And does it not ennoble all
feeling, does it not double our being and elevate us above ourselves?
In contrast to social inequalities, the love relationship points to a
higher law, before which all are
<span class="nowrap">equal.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The love of Rousseau is, in fact, not social; it is not a product
of civilization, but it is a creation of nature; it is one with nature.
The nature-sense and the love-sense are here most intimately
associated. And he observes both, nature and love, <b>with feeling</b>.
The <i>sensibilit&eacute; de l&#8217;&acirc;me</i> finds in nature and in love objects of the
most glorious delight, of the sweetest pain, of the most burning
tears.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Out of the perceptions of mingled pain and ecstasy which the
vision of nature, of beauty, or of a fine action, induced in him, he wove
the web of sensibility with which he enveloped the creatures of his
imagination. Incessantly thrust back into himself, his heart bleeding
from wounded friendship or from unrequited love, self-tormentingly
dissecting his own wishes and illusions, his own faculties and impossibilities,
he became one of the first heralds of the Weltschmerz, of
the woes of Werther and Ren&eacute;, to which Byron and Heine had only
to add <span class="nowrap">self-mockery.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor142"></a><a href="#Footnote142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentimentality of the eighteenth century took its rise in
England, as I have explained at some length in my pseudonymous
work, &#8220;The Sexual Life in England,&#8221; vol. ii., pp. 95-107
(Berlin, 1903). In that country it found its most characteristic
expression in the romances of Richardson and Sterne, and in
landscape-gardening; but it was by Rousseau and Goethe that
for the first time it was really brought into contact with the
realities of life.</p>

<p>For the history of Julie, the history of Werther&mdash;this was the
history of all happily or unhappily loving youths and maidens of
that day; each maiden had her Saint Preux, each youth his Lotte.</p>

<p>The profound influence exercised by Rousseau, especially on
women, has been described by H. Buffenoir in a very careful

The significance which &#8220;Werther&#8221; had for the emotional
life of the time has been explained with the most cultivated
understanding by Erich Schmidt in a well-known
<span class="nowrap">monograph.<a id="FNanchor144"></a><a href="#Footnote144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>He shows that the nature-sense and sentimentality are much
more deeply felt in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Werther&#8221; than in Rousseau&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
&#8220;Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se.&#8221; Goethe himself says in &#8220;Wahrheit und
Dichtung,&#8221; speaking of this poetical, rational, intimate, and
loving absorption into nature:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I endeavoured to separate myself inwardly from everything foreign
to me, to regard the outward world lovingly, and to allow all beings,
from the human onwards, to influence me, each in its kind, as deeply
as was possible. Thus arose a wonderful alliance with the individual
objects of nature, and an inward harmony, a harmony with the
whole; so that every change, whether of places and of regions, or of
days and seasons, or of any possible kind, moved me to my inmost
soul. The painter&#8217;s view became associated with that of the poet;
the beautiful country landscape through which the friendly river
was wandering, increased my inclination to solitude, and favoured my
quiet attitude of contemplation extending itself in every direction.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Werther&#8217;s feeling for nature is intimately related to his love
passion. The two harmonize, and each exercises a reciprocal
influence upon the other. Nature is to Werther a second beloved.
The youth of nature, the spring of nature, are also the youth and
the spring of his love.</p>

<p>In the peculiar association of love with the nature-sense and
sentimentality, which is so characteristic of the time of Julie
and Werther, are to be found the first beginnings of the &#8220;<b>Weltschmerz</b>,&#8221;
with its erotically significant &#8220;ecstasy of sorrow.&#8221; The
following words in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Stella&#8221; appear to me to bind
Weltschmerz and eroticism in an extremely distinct relationship.
Stella says of men:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;They make us at once happy and miserable! They fill our heart
with feelings of bliss! What new, unknown feelings and hopes fill our
souls, when their stormful passion invades our nerves! How often
has everything in me trembled and throbbed, <b>when, in uncontrollable
tears, he has washed away the sorrows of a world on my breast</b>! I
begged him, for God&#8217;s sake, to spare himself!&mdash;to spare me!&mdash;in
vain!&mdash;<b>into my inmost marrow he fanned the flames which were
devouring himself</b>. And thus the girl, from head to foot, became all
heart, all sentiment.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Here we find clearly described the erotic element in mental
pain; and we observe the remarkable <b>increase</b> of passion
by means of sorrow, tears, and a profound perception of the
evil of the world. This Weltschmerz fans the flames of eroticism,
increases love, and ultimately gives rise to a peculiar sense of
power; it is, indeed, most frequently in the first bloom of love,
in the years of puberty, that its relations with sexuality are
most distinctly manifested. The celebrated alienist Mendel has
described this almost physiological Weltschmerz of the age of
puberty as &#8220;hypo-melancholia.&#8221; An indefinite, passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
longing, which seeks relief in tears, a by no means negligible
inclination to suicide&mdash;of which Werther is the classical exemplar&mdash;characterizes
this condition, which is connected with the
complete revolutionizing of the spiritual and emotional life by
means of the sexual. The Weltschmerz of youth is a latent
sexual sense of power.</p>

<p>How the nature-sense and love combine to constitute a perception
of Weltschmerz has been most beautifully expressed by
Byron and Heine in their poetry. With quite exceptional clearness,
Heine also describes it in a letter to Friedrich Merckel
(written at Nordeney on August 7, 1826), in which he described a
nightly recurring scene with a beautiful woman on the seashore:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The sea no longer appeared so romantic as before&mdash;and yet on
its strand I had lived through the <b>sweetest</b> and most mystically dear
experience of my life which could ever inspire a poet. The moon
seemed to wish to show me that in this world happiness yet remained
for me. We did not speak&mdash;it was only a long, profound glance, the
moonlight supplied the music&mdash;as we walked to and fro, I took her
hand in mine, I felt the secret pressure&mdash;my soul trembled and
glowed&mdash;<b>afterwards I wept</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>How different were these tears from the floods of tears
in Miller&#8217;s &#8220;Siegwart,&#8221; and in other similar productions of the
Werther epoch, which, with their weakly sentimentality, their
emotionally happy &#8220;sensibility,&#8221; had nothing whatever in
common with the much more natural Weltschmerz of Goethe and
Heine&mdash;more natural because based on a physiological foundation.</p>

<p>In modern love also, the Weltschmerz continues to live. The
only difference is that by means of the pessimistic philosophy it
has to some extent obtained a logical foundation. And
Nietzsche has shown us the <b>force</b> which lies hidden in this ecstasy
of sorrow. Precisely on account of the pains of the world, he
affirms joyfully life and love. Anyone who wishes to write the
history of Weltschmerz, from a psychological point of view so
profoundly interesting, must not overlook Nietzsche as a most
important turning-point in that history.</p>

<p>The passion inspired by genius, the excess of vital energy in
the &#8220;Sturm und Drang&#8221; epoch of German literature, was
admirably consistent with that genuine, primitive Weltschmerz.
Rousseau&#8217;s more indeterminate sensibility had, on the other
hand, a more powerful influence upon the mode of feeling of
<b>romanticism</b>, and this movement appears more closely related
to him than to Goethe.</p>

<p><b>Romantic love</b> combines the elements of feeling of the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
epochs in an increased subjectivism. Not nature alone, but
history also, folk-tales, legends, poetry, and the wonderful
secrets of the primeval age&mdash;all these are reflected in romantic
love, and awaken singular dreams and emotions. The &#8220;mondbegl&auml;nzte
Zaubernacht&#8221; (&#8220;moon-illumined magic night&#8221;) is
much more than a mere feeling of nature; it is the recognition
of a connexion with the past and with its secret, sweet, half-forgotten
stories. Fonqu&eacute;&#8217;s &#8220;Undine&#8221; is the classical type of
all this. Romantic love delights in this wonder-mood of the
heart; reality becomes, as it were, a dream. The obscure, the
problematical&mdash;these attract the romanticist. It is for this
reason that he loves the night and the night-mood of nature,
rather than the clear daylight. <b>Moonshine reverie</b> is a characteristic
trait of romantic love. Everything flows away into the
indeterminate, the cloudy, the boundless. This love knows no
limitation or narrowing, no fetters. It is the sworn enemy of
the conventional, narrow-hearted, philistine morality, and of all
limitations of personality. In Friedrich Schlegel&#8217;s &#8220;Lucinde&#8221;
this most celebrated monument of romantic love, the campaign
against philistinism, as the greatest enemy of a free, noble
amatory life, is most energetically carried on. It is utterly
untrue to describe &#8220;Lucinde&#8221; as a romance in which there is
a cult of suggestive nudity&mdash;as the poetry of the flesh. It
certainly preaches the free natural conception and perception
of the nude and the sexual, and is a glorious protest against the
artificial and hypocritical separation of body and soul in love;
but, on the other side, it unlocks in love the entire kingdom
of the emotional and spiritual life, and discloses its significance
for the individual man as a free personality.</p>

<p>More than Rousseau&#8217;s &#8220;Julie&#8221; and Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Werther&#8221; is
Friedrich Schlegel&#8217;s &#8220;Lucinde&#8221; the apotheosis of individual
love. Romantic love is the mirror of personality; it is changeable,
filled with the highest spiritual content, and, above all, like
personality, is capable of development. In a masterly manner
Schlegel has represented the intimate connexion between true
love and all vital energy. The relations of love to genius have
never before been so admirably described.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; says Karl Gutzkow, &#8220;there is no question of artificiality;
we have to do rather with the yearning of a youth who loves, who sees
the one and only beloved in many different forms, in the metamorphoses
of his own ego, which yearns to reconcile egoism and love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schleiermacher, in his &#8220;Confidential Letters regarding
Lucinde,&#8221; Gutzkow in his preface to the new edition of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
work, and recently H. <span class="nowrap">Meyer-Benfey,<a id="FNanchor145"></a><a href="#Footnote145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
have supplied us with
conclusions regarding the true significance of &#8220;Lucinde,&#8221; conclusions
in harmony with our own view.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>We must allude here to a new element in romantic love, which
since that time has played an important part in modern eroticism.
It is <i>l&#8217;art pour l&#8217;art</i> of love, the revelling in pure moods
and emotions as the means of enjoyment. The emotional
frequently grows luxuriantly and chokes the natural feeling of
love. Jean Paul, for example,</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;regards eroticism purely as a method of cultivation. Human beings
are not to be actually loved, but are to be used to strike sparks from,
by which one&#8217;s own inward life may be illuminated.... He is the
exemplar of that artist-love which, vampire-like, drinks the souls of
those who become its prey. This love sees in the hearts offered to it
only the stuff for pictures; and in their warm blood it finds only an
intoxicating, stimulating
<span class="nowrap">drink.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This unqualified search for personal emotional experiences in
love, without regard to the love-partner, is especially represented
in Jean Paul&#8217;s &#8220;Titan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wackenroder, in his &#8220;Phantasien &uuml;ber die Kunst&#8221; (&#8220;Imaginative
Studies concerning Art&#8221;), has already warned us of the
dangers of this purely erotic-emotional love. Karl Joel has
recently described very vividly how the romanticists ultimately
reduced all vital relationships to the emotions of
<span class="nowrap">love.<a id="FNanchor147"></a><a href="#Footnote147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span> This
attempt must lead finally to mysticism, the poetical representative
of which is Novalis.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to find that all the diverse elements of
romantic love may also be detected in the latter-day renascence
of romanticism. In his admirable book on &#8220;Nietzsche and
Romanticism,&#8221; Karl Joel has clearly shown the existence of this
romantic element in modern love, and, above all, has insisted
upon the intimate connexion which the philosophy of Nietzsche
has with the joy in battle and the vital energy of the romanticists.
Both are apostles of the Dionysiac, not of the
<span class="nowrap">Apollinian.<a id="FNanchor148"></a><a href="#Footnote148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>This also is the difference by which &#8220;romantic&#8221; love is distinguished
from &#8220;<b>classical</b>&#8221; love&mdash;a difference and a distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
which I find indicated for the first time in Theodor Mundt&#8217;s
romance &#8220;Madelon oder die Romantiker in Paris&#8221; (Leipzig, 1832).</p>

<p>The relevant passage (pp. 9-12) runs as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I am therefore of opinion that there can be a romantic and a
classical poetry; there are also romantic and classical love; and it is
only by means of this twofold nature that it is possible to discover
and understand this contrast in poetry....</p>

<p>&#8220;This wild and yet so sweet disturbance of the heart, in which love
subsists, this rejoicing and revelry of the aroused imagination which,
originated by the charm of the beloved, lead to an intoxication with
all the sensual dreams of a delightful, ethereal happiness; and as in
the flower-bud in which a burning ray of sunshine has suddenly
awakened the impulse to bloom, give rise to the desire and longing of
sensual impulsion&mdash;all these tears and sighs of the lovers, pains and
joys, this love-happiness and love-misery at the same time, this star-flaming
night-side of passion, to which after a vagrant drunken frenzy,
an ice-cold, unwelcome morning follows&mdash;all this, my friend, is
romantic love....</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall I now describe also <b>classical</b> love?... Believe me,
there are faces which at the very first glance seem to us so trustworthy
and so near akin, they draw us to them, as if we had spent years with
them in sympathy, asking for love and receiving love. By the sight of
this girl&#8217;s face there was induced in me so suddenly a sense of peace,
such as never before in my life had I experienced; and this gentle
feeling which drew me towards her, I may call true love and true
happiness. In her loving eyes there glowed no seductive fire, no repellent
pride like that of our romantic Madelon; in the simple beautiful
German girl, all is clear and true; out of her gentle features speaks
her gentle soul; and all for which I have longed in passionate, aberrant
hours of my life&mdash;a definite, unalloyed happiness in existence&mdash;seemed
to me, as I saw her for the very first time, to shine on me out of her
blue true eyes. My friend, is not that classical love?&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is the Apollinian-Platonic element of modern love which
Theodor Mundt here describes as &#8220;classical&#8221; love, and certainly
he wrongly places it before romantic love, which is the expression
of modern subjectivism and individualism. Such classical love
found in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Tasso&#8221; its most complete representation.
Here love was conceived as &#8220;possession, which should give
<b>peace</b>&#8221;; the beloved being influences after the manner of an
already understood picture. As Kuno Fischer remarks, in the
world of Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Tasso&#8221; the Platonic Eros is the fashion.
Love is here the pure, quiet contemplation of beauty in and with
the beloved.</p>

<p>Gretchen and Helena in &#8220;Faust&#8221; embody very clearly the
contrast between romantic and classical love. We find these
contrasts united in Wilhelm Heinse&#8217;s celebrated &#8220;Ardinghello,&#8221;
a romance which even to us at the present day seems so modern.<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
In this work we find the Dionysiac-Faustian impulse of the
loving individual, and the Apollinian-artistic contemplation of
the loved one, described with equal mastery.</p>

<p>In regard to love, Heinse was the prototype of &#8220;<b>Young
Germany</b>.&#8221; And we are young Germany.</p>

<p>For all the problems of amatory life which to-day occupy our
minds have already been made topics of public discussion by the
authors of young Germany. In young German love-philosophy,
the &#8220;Knights of the Spirit&#8221; as well as the &#8220;Knights of the
Flesh,&#8221; come to their full rights. Only the ignorant can regard
the so-called &#8220;emancipation of the flesh,&#8221; the apotheosis of lascivious
sensuality, as the sole characteristic of the efforts and
battles of our own time. No, he who wishes to understand
modern love, in all its <b>spiritual</b> manifestations and relationship,
let him read the writings of young Germany, especially the
works of Laube, Gutzkow, Mundt; and also those of Heine,
who has a more intimate relationship to young Germany than
he has to romanticism.</p>

<p>More especially <span class="nowrap">Gutzkow,<a id="FNanchor149"></a><a href="#Footnote149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span>
who appears to me the greatest and
most comprehensive spirit of the young German literature&mdash;indeed,
of the more recent German literature in general&mdash;overlooks
no single riddle and problem of modern eroticism. Of all the
writers of the nineteenth century, he has the profoundest knowledge
of women. How stimulating are his girl characters; how
true, notwithstanding their manifoldness! Wally, riding
proudly upon a white palfrey, outwardly an image of beauty, but,
like so many modern emancipated women, inwardly tormented by
the demon of doubt; Seraphine the dreamer, uncertain about
herself and her love, of whom the poet himself later admitted that
her character was based on reality;
<span class="nowrap">Idaline,<a id="FNanchor150"></a><a href="#Footnote150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span> full of majesty, the
ideal &#8220;bride of the waves,&#8221; a typical figure of conventional high
life, who yet in sudden revolution against this conventionalism
gives her whole being to a chance love, a love of the
<span class="nowrap">moment,<a id="FNanchor151"></a><a href="#Footnote151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span><span
class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
which alienates her from her betrothed and later husband, and
drives her to death; then, again, all the brilliant feminine
characters in the great romances, &#8220;Die Ritter vom Geiste,&#8221;
Melanie, Helene, Selma, Pauline, Olga&mdash;all are characters
bearing the stamp of reality in their spiritual and emotional
life, so various and yet so true, and, above all, in their
manifold, differentiated relationships to men, genuinely <b>modern</b>
women.</p>

<p>Gutzkow was also the first to bring upon the stage the modern
woman and the problems of modern love, long before the French
dramatists and before Ibsen.</p>

<p>As Karl Frenzel pointed out as early as 1864, Gutzkow made
the stage the battlefield of modern ideas. The inward contrasts of
love, the psychological problem of the heart&mdash;he first ventured to
deal with these in the dramatic form.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We all of us felt the wounds which &#8216;the world&#8217; inflicted on
Werner; we all wandered from the quiet violet, Agathe, to the brilliant
rose, Sidonie; as in Ottfried, so in ourselves, the love of the heart
battled with the love of the spirit. Who would admit himself to be
so miserably poor as never to have revelled, lived, and suffered, in
the play of these feelings? What wife has not, at least in imagination,
hesitated for a moment, like Ella Rose, between the lover and
the husband? Such figures as these bear in themselves the essence of
truth, and do not lose their lofty value because, perhaps, their garments
are not draped with sufficient harmony. They touch us,
because we recognize in them our own flesh and blood; and they fulfil,
in so far as the form of the society drama allows, Shakespeare&#8217;s canon
of dramatic art&mdash;they hold the mirror up to nature.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In his tragedies, &#8220;Werner,&#8221; &#8220;Ottfried,&#8221; &#8220;Ella Rose,&#8221;
Gutzkow presents in a masterly manner the inner life of the
time; we see in them the pulsing wing-beats of the souls, which
in pain, as it must be in these days, soar upwards in the effort to
attain beauty and <span class="nowrap">freedom.<a id="FNanchor152"></a><a href="#Footnote152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the young German authors, Gutzkow has best grasped
the problem of problems in love&mdash;the problem of <b>personality</b>.
In the painful question asked of Helene d&#8217;Azimont, in &#8220;Die
Ritter vom Geiste&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Is it, then, thy innermost need,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To be everything to others, <b>nothing to thyself</b>?<br /></span>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;this inalienable right to the safeguarding and development of
the individual personality, notwithstanding all the self-sacrifice
of passionate love, is most forcibly maintained. This is, indeed,
the true nucleus of all higher individual love between man and
woman.</p>

<p>Gutzkow has been accused, by those who had in mind only the
purely symbolic nudity scene in &#8220;Wally,&#8221; of preaching the
&#8220;emancipation of the flesh&#8221;; the same accusation has been
levelled against other young German authors, such as Lambe
(in &#8220;Jungen Europa&#8221;), Theodor Mundt (in the &#8220;Madonna&#8221;),
Wienbarg (in the &#8220;Aesthetische Feldz&uuml;ge&#8221;), Heine (in the
&#8220;Neue Gedichte&#8221;). The charge is unjust. It is only the
<b>poetry</b> of the flesh which they wish to bring to its rights. Notwithstanding
his enthusiastic hymn of praise to Casanova,
Theodor Mundt declares in his &#8220;Madonna&#8221; that the separation
of flesh and spirit is the &#8220;inexpiable suicide of the human
consciousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much more important, the true characteristic of all the authors
of young Germany, appear to me the parts which <b>self-analysis</b>
and <b>reflection</b> here for the first time play in love, visible beneath
the influence of the offshoots of French romanticism, in which,
however, we also encounter the same phenomenon, as in George
Sand&#8217;s &#8220;Lelia,&#8221; in Alfred de Musset&#8217;s &#8220;Confession d&#8217;un Enfant
du Si&egrave;cle,&#8221; in Balzac&#8217;s &#8220;Femme de Trente Ans&#8221;&mdash;in which last
romance we find the following passage:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Love assumes the colouring of every century. Now, in the year
1822, it is doctrinaire. Instead of, as formerly, proving it by deeds, it
is argued, it is discussed, it is brought upon the tribune in a speech.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><b>Just as in the middle ages the idea of &#8220;sin&#8221; was the disturbing
principle of love, so for the modern civilized man, since the days
of young Germany, this cold self-reflection, this critical analysis
of one&#8217;s peculiar passionate perceptions and feelings, is the
modern disturbing principle.</b> This is the worm which gnaws
unceasingly at the root of our love, and destroys its most
beautiful blossoms. Gutzkow&#8217;s &#8220;Wally the Doubter&#8221; and
&#8220;Seraphine&#8221; are the classical literary documents for this
destructive ascendancy of pure thought in love. Very noteworthy
is it that in both these romances it is <b>woman</b> who destroys
life and love by reflection, whilst from earliest days this danger
has always lain in the path of man. It is the fate of the modern
woman, of individual personalities, which is here depicted; this
fate makes its appearance from the moment when woman comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
to take a share in the spiritual life of man. The cold dialectic of
Seraphine, who, as Gutzkow makes one of her lovers say, reverses
the natural order of man and woman, is a necessary product of
the love of woman ripening in the direction of a free personality&mdash;happily,
however, it is only a <b>transient</b> phenomenon. The fully
developed personality will return to the primitiveness of feeling,
and will no longer endure within herself any kind of division or
laceration. The corresponding phenomena in man have been
described by Kierkegaard and Grillparzer in their diaries, which
are classical documents of &#8220;reflection-love.&#8221;</p>

<p>The love of the present day contains within itself, and nourishes
itself upon, all the above-described spiritual elements of the
past. More especially at the present day is the question of the
so-called <b>free love</b> or <b>free marriage</b>, disregardant of the legally
binding forms of civil and ecclesiastical marriage, representative
of all the heartfelt needs of highly civilized mankind, hitherto
held back, oppressed, and fettered by the materialism of the time,
and still more by its conventionalism still active beneath its
covering of outlived forms. The problem of free love was first
formulated in &#8220;Lucinde,&#8221; but found in the young German literature,
especially in the writings of Laube, Mundt, and Dingelstedt,
its theoretical foundation; and in the Bohemian life of the
Second Empire free love obtained its practical realization,
although the purely <b>idyllic</b> character of this Bohemian life, and
its limitation to the circle of the <i>dolce far niente</i> students and
artists, in truth makes it differ widely from the most intensely
personal free love, <b>taking its part fully in the struggle for life</b>, as
it presents itself in the ideal form to modern humanity.</p>

<p>The Second French Empire, whose significance for the spiritual
tendencies of our time was a very great one, allowed two elements
of love, to which we have earlier alluded, to appear with marked
predominance&mdash;elements still influential at the present day:
the <b>satanic-diabolic</b> element of eroticism, which found its most
incisive expression in the works of Barbey d&#8217;Aurevilly (strongly
influenced by the writings of de Sade), of Baudelaire, and more
particularly of the great F&eacute;licien Rops; and the purely artistic
element, as it appears in the works of the authors just mentioned,
but more especially in the writings of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier. This
&#8220;Young France&#8221; (to use the name of a novel of Gautier&#8217;s) has
influenced the amatory life and the amatory theory of the present
day almost as strongly as young Germany.</p>

<p>At the same time, in the sixties of the nineteenth century
Schopenhauer&#8217;s philosophy was dominant in Germany, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
metaphysic of love, which considered the individual not at all, but
the species as all in all&mdash;this <b>pessimistic</b> conception of all love
found its poetic expression in Edward Grisebach&#8217;s &#8220;New
Tanh&auml;user,&#8221; published in 1869. Here, also, it would be a grave
error to condemn these erotic poems of the day, on account of
their glowing sensuality, as mere glorifications of carnal lust.
The poet himself was the new Tanh&auml;user. He wished, as he
often told me, to find expression in these poems for the life-denying
as well as for the life-affirming forces. He sang the pleasure
and the pain, the hopes and the disappointments of modern love.
For him love is indeed the rose <b>with</b> the thorns. For this reason
the motto of the poem is a saying of Meister Eckart: &#8220;The voluptuousness
of the creature is intermingled with bitterness;&#8221; and
this is the theme of the poets, though expressed in numerous
variations: &#8220;There is no pleasure without regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for this reason Grisebach&mdash;and in this respect he resembles
Nietzsche&mdash;wished none the less joyfully to affirm this life, filled
as it is with pain, and in all its activity bringing with it regrets.
In this sense he is no exclusive pessimist, but an apostle of <b>activity</b>,
like the men of young Germany, in whose footsteps, and especially
in those of Heine, he follows. The beautiful saying of Laube, in
his &#8220;Liebesbriefen&#8221; (Leipzig, 1835, p. 29), &#8220;He who has never
been shaken to the depths by any profound sorrow is also ignorant
of all deep rejoicing, he knows no single verse of that enthusiasm
which woos the denied heaven, he experiences no sort of religion,
he is capable of no sacrifice, of no greatness,&#8221; is suited also to
the &#8220;new Tanh&auml;user,&#8221; which so powerfully influenced German
youth during the seventies and eighties of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>He who wishes to understand how the various love-problems
are represented in the literature of the present, strongly influenced
as it is by the problem-poems of Ibsen, by Zola&#8217;s naturalism, and
by the French <span class="nowrap">symbolism<a id="FNanchor153"></a><a href="#Footnote153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span>
dependent on him, will find it described
later in a special chapter devoted to love in the literature of
to-day.</p>

<p>In the following chapter we have to consider one additional
influence which is especially apparent in the love and eroticism of
the present day, and possesses great importance for the individualization
of love. This is the artistic element in modern
love.</p>

may quote, however, with satisfaction the prophecy of the deceased dramatist
Theodor Wehl. He writes of Gutzkow: &#8220;As a literary phenomenon he will
grow with time. After long, long years, out of the literature of our time two
characteristic heads will emerge&mdash;one laughing, and one glancing round him
earnestly and sorrowfully: the head of Heinrich Heine, and the head of Karl

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class="noindent">At the present day, notwithstanding all the adverse opinions and
jeremiads of infatuated apostles of morality, the epoch of our
amatory life through which we are passing is by no means one of
decadence. On the contrary, we are now actually engaged in its
re-constitution, reform, and ennoblement. All the tendencies of
the time proceed towards such a radical perfectionment of love,
towards its free, individual configuration, not by the unchaining
of sensuality, but by its idealization; and when we have once
attained a natural view of sensuality, it loses all its terrors. We
fight at first against the elemental force of the wild impulse,
and against the elemental force of life-denying asceticism. In
this struggle the artistic element in modern love plays a notable
part. By this we do not signify &#8220;sugary&#8221; &aelig;stheticism, nor yet
the completely non-sensual Platonic Eros, but that &aelig;sthetic
tendency in human love, bringing about an intimate association
of the bodily and spiritual, which W. B&ouml;lsche denotes by the
term &#8220;rhythmotropism.&#8221; It is &#8220;an impulsive, forced reaction
of the higher animal brain to rhythmical beauty,&#8221; to which
art also owes its origin. This &aelig;sthetic natural impulse is of
great importance to love, as Darwin recognized many years ago.
It was he who expressed the great thought that beauty is love
become perceptible.</p>

<p>The sexual is in no way hostile to &aelig;sthetic contemplation, as
the unhappy Weininger quite erroneously maintained in the
confused chapter &#8220;Erotism and &AElig;sthetics&#8221; of his book. He
curtly denies that sexuality has any &aelig;sthetic value whatever,
yet Plato himself deduced from the physical Eros the highest
&aelig;sthetic contemplation of a spiritual nature. In the world of
the senses he discovered the reflection of the Divine.</p>

<p>The well-known fact that with the awakening of the sexual
life, spiritual creative activity also awakens, and an artistic
tendency becomes kinetic, that at the time of puberty every
youth is a poet, confirms the suggested existence of this intimate
relationship between sexual and &aelig;sthetic perception.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;There appears to me to be no doubt,&#8221; says J. Volkelt in his
&#8220;&AElig;sthetics&#8221; (vol. i., p. 523; Munich, 1905), &#8220;that in the youth or
the maiden the awakening of sexuality induces an individualization
and invigoration of artistic perception. Hand in hand with the first
love of youth, somewhere about the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
sense of grace and beauty in the landscape, the appreciation of the
charm of poetry, painting, and music, are strengthened and refined
to such a degree, that in comparison with what is now felt, all earlier
experiences and enjoyments seem to be as nothing.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Sensuality first gives life colour, brings out the nuances and
the finer tones of feeling, without which life would be tinted a
uniform grey, would be a monotonous waste, and lacking which
the joy of existence and creative activity would be annihilated,
or, at least, would be reduced to a minimum. Even the most
ideal love must be nourished upon sensuality, if it is to remain
poietic and full of vitality. Of this Annette von Droste-H&uuml;lshoff
is an interesting example&mdash;a woman and poet in whom in other
respects sexual influences can have played only a very modest
part. But she lost on the instant all poetic capacity, all artistic
creative power, when her lover, Lewin Sch&uuml;cking, became engaged
to Louise von Gall. The mere idea of the <b>possibility</b> of
physical possession was to her a spur to poetic activity without
its being necessary for this possibility to be translated into reality.
But when the possibility was for ever removed, her muse at once
became dumb.</p>

<p>An absolutely convincing proof of the intimate connexion
between sexuality and &aelig;sthetics is the fact that great artists and
poets have, in the majority of cases, possessed thoroughly sensual
natures. The previously described relationship between the
sexual impulse and the poietic impulse, comprised in the &#8220;function
impulse&#8221; of Santlus, is especially manifest in the case of
artists. In these artistic natures the perceptive &aelig;sthetic power
is associated with an ardent sensuality, which derives its most
powerful impulse directly from the beautiful. We agree with
von Krafft-Ebing when he denies the possibility of genius, art,
and poetry except upon a sexual foundation. We do not believe
in a so-called purely &aelig;sthetic contemplation and perception
without any sexual admixture. Even Volkelt, who is inclined
to sever art and the sexual impulse each from the other, is unable
to deny the genetic connexion between the two. Oskar Bie
makes the interesting observation that &#8220;in &aelig;sthetic relationships
the cord of the will does not become thinner to the breaking
point, but stronger, until it becomes blind passion&#8221; (<i>Neue
Deutsche Rundschau</i>, 1894, p. 479). Nietzsche and Guyau have
also declared themselves opposed to Schopenhauer&#8217;s theory
regarding the absence of a will-element in &aelig;sthetic perception.
Nietzsche speaks even of an &#8220;&aelig;sthetic of the sexual impulse.&#8221;
Guyau bases his &aelig;sthetic upon the love of life and upon sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
love (&#8220;Les Probl&egrave;mes de l&#8217;Esth&eacute;tique Contemporaine,&#8221; Paris,
1897). Magnus Hirschfeld alludes in his &#8220;Wesen der Liebe&#8221;
(&#8220;The Nature of Love&#8221;), p. 48, to a work by G. Santayana
entitled &#8220;The Sense of Beauty,&#8221; in which the theory is propounded
that &#8220;for human beings the whole of nature is an object of sexual
perception, and it is chiefly in this way that the beauty of nature
is to be explained.&#8221; Finally, Gustav Naumann (&#8220;Sex and Art:
Prolegomena to Physiological &AElig;sthetics,&#8221; Leipzig, 1899) says
most convincingly that the sexual is the <b>root</b> of all art, of all
&aelig;sthetics.</p>

<p>But whatever view may be held regarding the relationship
between sexuality and art, it is a quite incontestable fact that our
latter-day life is characterized by a need &#8220;for erotic illusion&#8221;
(to use the expression of Konrad Lange), that the slighter degree
of eroticism, as it exhibits itself in social intercourse between the
two sexes, is principally of an artistic nature. I do not speak
here merely of the dance as the artistic transfiguration of the
erotic phenomena of courtship, or of dress and fashion and the
whole <i>milieu</i> as &aelig;sthetic means of expression of the personality
(as they were described in earlier pages of this work), but I refer
above all to <b>social intercourse</b> as a whole, which to-day represents
a free and facile &aelig;sthetic element, in which modern love receives
its most manifold suggestions.</p>

<p>Emerson, in his essay on Love, has very beautifully described
the importance to our civilized life of these slight, imponderable
influences of an erotic-&aelig;sthetic nature; and Konrad Lange, in
his &#8220;Wesen der Kunst&#8221; (vol. ii., p. 23; Berlin, 1901), refers the
pleasure of social intercourse ultimately to the sexual impulse,
even though therein sensuality is mitigated by illusion and is
elevated to a purer sphere. Erotic enjoyment is modified into a
&#8220;love-play,&#8221; sensuality is refined, spiritualized, dematerialized.
It is precisely this &aelig;sthetic eroticism which at the present day
becomes of increasing importance in the emotional life of civilized
humanity, in the life of those engaged in the hard struggle for
existence, to whom time and leisure are lacking for the &#8220;great&#8221;
love-passion. For such as these, these gentler suggestions constitute
the true charm of life, into the dreary monotony of which
they bring light and colour.</p>

<p>In his excellent &#8220;Remarks on Goethe&#8217;s Stella,&#8221; Wilhelm
Scherer has assigned its true value to this erotic &aelig;stheticism and
&aelig;sthetic eroticism of society and social intercourse. He speaks
of a charm of personal presence, which brings out all that is
best in two human beings. He speaks of an enthusiastic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
complete surrender of the spirit and the emotions, in which the
souls seem to enter into inseparable union&mdash;and yet only seem.
For in reality this surrender occurs for weeks, for days, for
minutes, for moments, and to various persons. These frequent,
individual, purely spiritual contacts between the two sexes
have completely the character of &aelig;sthetic joy; they give rise
to a perception of <b>freedom</b>, of liberation from the power of the
senses. Who does not know the happy freedom of spirit which is
aroused by the glance of a beautiful girl, by the smile of a
sympathetic face?</p>

<p>This &aelig;sthetic incitation by means of eroticism has, moreover,
in it something <b>vitalizing</b>, something which spurs on the will,
because its cause&mdash;eroticism itself&mdash;contains within it such an
element of action and vital energy. The modern love ideals of
the sexes have a peculiar impulsive force. Classical beauty taken
by itself, and without the individual, personal characteristic
element, is valueless. And woman herself also is no longer the
patient Gretchen of yore. She must have temperament, character,
passion&mdash;she must be a personality.</p>

<p>More than by the beautiful are we allured by the characteristic,
by the developed personality, by the passionate, the subjective
in woman&mdash;by that which, in pursuance of a false connotation,
is often now termed &#8220;nervous&#8221; beauty. The pale Josepha of
the days of Heine&#8217;s boyhood is an example of this type.</p>

<p>In her &#8220;Buch der Frauen&#8221; (&#8220;Book of Women&#8221;) (Paris and
Leipzig, 1895), Laura Marholm has described in the figures of
Marie Bashkirtzeff, Anna Charlotte Loeffler, Eleonore Duse,
George Egerton, Amalie Skram, and Sonja Kowalewska, well-marked
and characteristic types of modern woman as a personality.</p>

<p>This attraction to the characteristic, to the personal, in the
aspect of woman conflicts to some extent with the preference
arising under the influence of the English &#8220;Pre-Raphaelites,&#8221;
of Burne-Jones and Rossetti, for straight lines, for slender,
ethereal, unduly spiritual, supersensual forms, which no longer
express the free personality of the mature, complete woman,
but approximate rather to the infantile, asexual habitus. In
this case, however, we have to do with a mere transient fashion,
which cannot countervail the above characterized general tendency
towards the personal.</p>

<p>This personal, individual has in man even greater importance
than actual beauty. It is a distinctive fact that, throughout
the history of civilization, men have always had a clearer understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
of &#8220;masculine beauty&#8221; than women. Women have
preferred power, intelligence, energy of will, and marked individuality.
Caroline Schlegel, in a letter to Luise Gotter,
writes of Mirabeau: &#8220;Hideous he may have been&mdash;he says so
himself frequently in his letters&mdash;but Sophie loved him, <b>for what
women love in men is certainly not beauty</b>&#8221; (&#8220;Letters of Caroline
Schlegel,&#8221; vol. i., p. 93; edited by G. Waitz, Leipzig, 1871). This
conception also elucidates the words in the second part of Goethe&#8217;s
&#8220;Faust&#8221;:</p>

<span class="i1">Attain rights of possession.&#8221;<br /></span>

<p class="noindent">It explains, too, the opinion of Eduard von Hartmann (&#8220;Philosophie
des Unbewussten&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Philosophy of the Unconscious,&#8221;
p. 205; Berlin, 1874), that the most powerful passions are not
aroused by the most beautiful, but, on the contrary, by the
ugliest, individuals. The influence of powerfully developed individuality
is, in fact, notably greater than that of physical
beauty. The mystic Swedenborg long ago declared that in man
woman desired truth, spiritual significance, not beauty
<span class="nowrap">alone.<a id="FNanchor154"></a><a href="#Footnote154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Herein we see a suggestion of the fact that true beauty is ultimately
spiritual beauty, the expression of the force of will, of
poietic activity, and of free personality.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class="noindent">Since the subject first engaged my close attention, it has always
seemed to me incomprehensible that a dispute should ever have
arisen among anthropologists, ethnologists, and historians of
civilization as to whether, among the primitive forms of the
sexual relationship, marriage was the first, or whether it was
preceded by a state of sexual promiscuity.</p>

<p>Whoever knows the nature of the sexual impulse, whoever has
arrived at a clear understanding regarding the course of human
evolution, and, finally, whoever has studied the conditions that
even now prevail, alike among primitive peoples and among
modern civilized races, in the matter of sexual relations, can have
no doubt whatever that <b>in the beginnings of human development
a state of sexual promiscuity did actually</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>prevail</b>.<a id="FNanchor155"></a><a href="#Footnote155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The ideal goal,&#8221; says Heinrich Schurtz, &#8220;towards which, more
or less consciously, civilized humanity is undoubtedly advancing, involuntarily
also becomes the standard by which the past is judged,
and sentiment and mood take the place of a single-minded endeavour
to arrive at truth.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Thus it has happened that the ideal of permanent marriage
between a single man and a single woman, which, in fact, as we
shall proceed to explain, must persist as <b>an ideal of civilization
never to be lost</b>, has been employed as a standard for the judgment
of bygone conditions. This error is one into which Westermarck
more especially has fallen in his &#8220;History of Human Marriage&#8221;
(Jena, 1893)&mdash;a work of considerable value from its richness in
ethnological detail. Hence Westermarck&#8217;s criticism of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
doctrine of promiscuity, based as it is upon false premises, &#8220;has
ultimately remained barren,&#8221; as Heinrich Schurtz has
<span class="nowrap">proved.<a id="FNanchor156"></a><a href="#Footnote156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
Westermarck, for example, simply ignores the fact that within
the group-marriage of sexual associates, within the totem,
promiscuity undoubtedly existed.</p>

<p>Since, as we shall see, among the tribes and races living in
social unions, sexual promiscuity can be proved to have existed
side by side with, and commonly in advance of, the development
of marriage, it is indubitable that primitive man, in whom the
sexual impulse was still purely instinctive, had simply no knowledge
of &#8220;marriage&#8221; in the modern sense of the term. Otherwise,
indeed, the &#8220;mother-right&#8221; would not have been necessary,
for matriarchy was the typical expression of the uncertainty
of paternity which resulted from sexual promiscuity.</p>

<p>The great freedom of sexual intercourse in primitive times is
denoted by various investigators by many different terms; sometimes
it is called &#8220;promiscuity,&#8221; sometimes &#8220;free-love,&#8221; sometimes
&#8220;group-marriage,&#8221; &#8220;polyandry,&#8221; &#8220;polygamy,&#8221; &#8220;religious
and sexual prostitution,&#8221; etc. The classical works of Bachofen,
Bastian, Giraud-Teulon, von Hellwald, Kohler, Friedrich S.
Krauss, Lubbock, MacLennan, Morgan, Friedrich M&uuml;ller, Post,
H. Schurtz, Wilcken, and others, have proved beyond question
the existence of this primordial hetairism.</p>

<p>When modern critics at length find it convenient to admit the
overwhelming force of the enormous mass of evidence that has
been collected concerning this subject, they still exhibit a great
dislike to the conception and the term sexual &#8220;promiscuity,&#8221;
whereby is understood the boundless and indiscriminate intermingling
of the sexes. They admit the possibility of group-marriage,
although this is merely a socially limited form of promiscuity;
they admit even the existence of polyandry and
polygamy, and of indiscriminate religious prostitution; but they
refuse to believe in the existence of genuine promiscuity.</p>

<p>And yet, if they only chose to make use of their eyes, they
could observe sexual promiscuity at the present day among the
modern civilized nations. In certain strata and classes of the
population, such an indiscriminate and unregulated sexual intercourse,
in no way leading to the formation of enduring relationships,
can be observed to-day. Ask a young man, even of the
better classes, with how many women he has had connexion during<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
a single year&mdash;not one of these need have been a prostitute&mdash;and,
if he speaks the truth, you will be astounded at the number
of the &#8220;objects of lust&#8221;! This last expression is suitable enough,
because in most cases there is no individual relationship between
such casual partners. Ask certain girls also&mdash;maidservants, for
example, or girls engaged in the manufacture of ready-made
clothing&mdash;and you will obtain analogous information regarding the
number of their annual lovers. Phillip Frey (&#8220;Der Kampf der
Geschlechter&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;The Battle of the Sexes,&#8221; p. 51; Vienna, 1904)
bases on similar grounds the assumption of a primitive sexual
promiscuity; he refers especially to the condition of the seaports:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Ports in which ocean-going vessels come to harbour are familiar
with the sexual impulse in its most completely animal form, and
devoid of every refinement and concealment. We find ourselves
transported into the depths of an urgent primitiveness and savagery,
which gives the lie to the advance in civilization, and this will enable
us to form a clearer idea of the bestial indifference in sexual matters
that must have obtained amongst the herds of primitive man. Intercourse
between man and woman promoted by the lust of the moment,
dependent solely upon reciprocal animal desire, the various male and
female individuals of the human herd differing too little each from the
other to make it worth while to strive for permanent rights of possession,
the absence of any ownership of land amongst those wandering
to and fro through the primeval forest, the common ownership of
children by the herd or tribe&mdash;that such was the primitive, ape-like
condition of the human race, one actually inferior to that of many
other mammals, is a belief amply justified by the polygamous and
polyandrous instincts of <i>homo sapiens</i>, recurring again and again in
all the stages of civilization.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Fortunately, ethnology furnishes us with incontrovertible
proofs of genuine promiscuity.</p>

<p>Of the Nasomoni in Africa, Herodotus (iv. 172) reports:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;When a Nasomonian man takes his first wife, it is the custom that
on the <b>first</b> night the bride should be visited by each of the guests in
turn, and each one, as he leaves, gives her a present which he had
brought with him to the house.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Diodorus Siculus makes a similar report regarding the inhabitants
of the Balearic Islands (v. 18). Have we not here an echo
of primeval custom, of sexual promiscuity prior to marriage?</p>

<p>Very interesting are the accounts recently given by Melnikow
regarding the free sexual relationships customary among the
Siberian Buryats. There before marriage unregulated sexual
intercourse between men and girls prevails. This is especially
to be observed at festival seasons. Such festivals occur usually
late in the evening, and can rightly be called &#8220;nights of love.<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>&#8221;
Near the villages bonfires are lighted, round which the men and
women dance monotonous dances termed &#8220;nadan.&#8221; From time
to time pairs separate from the thousands of dancers, and disappear
into the darkness; soon they return and resume their place
in the dance, to disappear again by and by into the obscurity;
but they are not the same couples that disappear each time, <b>for
they continually change</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>partners</b>.<a id="FNanchor157"></a><a href="#Footnote157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Is this not promiscuity? In a mitigated form we can see the
same among ourselves. A case recently came under my notice
in which two friends made an exchange of their &#8220;intimates&#8221;;
moreover, the &#8220;intimacy&#8221; in each case had been of very brief
duration. This, indeed, happened in the full light of day; while
among the Buryats the darkness concealed a completely indiscriminate
promiscuity.</p>

<p>Marco Polo reports as a remarkable custom of the inhabitants
of Thibet, that there a man would in no circumstances marry a
girl who was a virgin, for they say a wife is worth nothing if she
has not had intercourse with men. Girls were offered to the
traveller, and he was expected to reward the courtesy with a ring
or some other trifle, which the girl, when she wished to marry,
would show as one of her &#8220;love-tokens.&#8221; <b>The more such tokens
she possessed, the more she was in request as a</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>wife.</b><a id="FNanchor158"></a><a href="#Footnote158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>From New Holland we receive similar reports.</p>

<p>Of especial importance, as proving the existence of sexual
promiscuity, are the investigations of the student of folk-lore,
Friedrich S. Krauss, regarding the sexual life of the Southern
Slavs. Krauss has, indeed, rendered most valuable aids to the
scientific study and anthropological foundation of the human
sexual life; a place of honour among the founders of &#8220;anthropologia
sexualis&#8221; must be given to Krauss, and also to Bastian,
Post, Kohler, Mantegazza, and Ploss-Bartels.</p>

<p>Dr. Krauss first published his pioneer investigations in
&#8220;Kryptadia,&#8221; vols. vi. and vii. (Paris, 1899 and 1901); but later
he founded an annual for the record of researches into the folk-lore
and ethnology of the sexual life, entitled &#8220;Anthropophyteia:
Jahrbuch f&uuml;r folkloristische Erhebungen und Forschungen zur
Entwicklungsgeschichte der geschlechtlichen Moral&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Anthropophyteia:
Annual for Folk-lorist Investigations and Researches
in the History of the Evolution of Sexual Morality.&#8221; This has
been published now for four years, 1904-1907, Krauss having the<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
co-operation of anthropologists, ethnologists, folk-lorists, and
medical men, such as Thomas Achelis, Iwan Bloch, Franz Boas,
Albert Eulenburg, Anton Herrmann, Bernhard Obst, Giuseppe
Pitr&eacute;, Isak Robinsohn, and Karl von dem Steinen. It constitutes
a most important addition to the hitherto very scanty works for
the scientific study of sexual problems. Later, I shall have
occasion to refer again to this important undertaking. Krauss,
who, as he himself says, is insensitive to the romantic appeal of
folk-lore, but has an open mind for the realities and possibilities
of human history, has proved in this publication the unquestionable
existence of sexual promiscuity among the Southern Slavs.
As he himself declares, such an abundance of trustworthy proofs,
obtained by a professional folk-lorist, regarding the existence of a
form of sexual promiscuity within the narrow sphere of a single
geographical province of research, has not hitherto been
available.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, perfectly clear that the human need for sexual
variety, which is an established anthropological
<span class="nowrap">phenomenon,<a id="FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>
must in primitive times have been much stronger and more
unbridled, in proportion as the whole of life had not hitherto
risen above the needs of purely physical requirements. Since
even in our own time, in a state of the most advanced civilization,
after the development of a sexual morality penetrating and
influencing our entire social life, this natural need for variety
continues to manifest itself in almost undiminished strength, we
can hardly regard it as necessary to prove that in primitive conditions
sexual promiscuity was a more original, and, indeed, a
more <b>natural</b>, state than marriage.</p>

<p>For from the purely <b>anthropological</b> standpoint&mdash;only from this
standpoint, since with questions of morality, society, and civilization
we are not now concerned&mdash;permanent marriage appears a
thoroughly <b>artificial</b> institution, which even to-day fails to do
justice to the human need for sexual variety, since, indeed, vast
numbers of men live <i>de jure</i> monogamously, but <i>de facto</i> polygamously&mdash;a
fact pointed out by Schopenhauer. This criticism
is, of course, based upon purely physical sensual considerations;
it does not touch marriage as an ideal of civilization possessing a
<b>spiritual and moral</b> content.</p>

<p>The other social forms of sexual intercourse, forms whose existence
is admitted even by the critics of promiscuity, are characterized
by frequent <b>changes</b> in sexual relationships. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
especially true of the oldest form of marriage, the so-called
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>group-marriage</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor160"></a><a href="#Footnote160"
class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Group-marriage is not a union in marriage of isolated individuals,
but such a union between two <b>tribal groups</b>, composed
respectively of male and female individuals, a union between
the so-called <b>totems</b>.</p>

<p>The social instinct, the impulse towards companionship, upon
which even to-day the State and the family depend, united mankind
at one time into tribes of a peculiar kind, which felt themselves
to constitute single individuals, and believed themselves to be
inspired by an animal spirit, their protective spirit. Their union
was known as the totem.</p>

<p>Group-marriage is <b>the marriage of one totem with another</b>&mdash;that
is, the men of one totem-group marry the women of another,
and <i>vice versa</i>. But <b>no individual man has any particular wife</b>.
On the contrary, if, for example, twenty men of the first totem
espoused twenty women of the second totem, then each one of
the twenty men had an equivalent share of each one of the
twenty women, and <i>vice versa</i>. This was indeed an advance over
unrestricted sexual promiscuity, limited by no social forms;
but it afforded no possibility of any individual relationships of
love, it remained promiscuity within narrow bounds. Group-marriages
exist at the present day in Australia in a well-developed
form among certain tribes; whilst, as an occasional custom, in
the form of an exchange of wives among friends, guests, and
relatives, it appears to be almost universally diffused throughout
Australia. Schurtz regards Australian group-marriage as a
kind of partial taming of the wild sexual impulse.</p>

<p>Well known is the description of group-marriage in ancient
Britain given by Julius C&aelig;sar: &#8220;The husbands possess their
wives to the number of ten or twelve in common, and more especially
brothers with brothers, or parents with children.&#8221; Here we
have a special variety of group-marriage.</p>

<p>According to Bernh&ouml;ft, <b>polyandry</b> is also to be regarded as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
vestige of a primitive form of group-marriage, arising from a
deficiency of women in a totem, so that one woman was left as
the representative of the totem married to several husbands.
Marshall has, in fact, amongst the polyandrous Toda in Southern
India, actually observed group-marriage side by side with
polyandry.</p>

<p>Among certain Indian tribes we find even at the present day
indications of group-marriage. For example, the husband will
have a claim on the sisters of his wife, or even on her cousins or
her aunts, and gradually he may marry them. In this case we
see that <b>polygyny</b> has developed out of the group-marriage.</p>

<p>The widely diffused practice of <b>wife-lending</b> and <b>wife-exchange</b>
is also connected with the conditions of group marriage. In
Hawaii, in Australia, among the Massai and the Herero in South
Africa, we encounter this custom, but more especially in Angola
and at the mouth of the Congo, also in North-Eastern Asia, and
among many tribes of North American Indians.</p>

<p>Schurtz points out that similar conditions may arise among
European proletariat in consequence of inadequate housing
accommodation.</p>

<p>In this state of a somewhat limited promiscuity the only
natural tie was that between mother and child. The child
belonged exclusively to the mother, and therefore, in the wider
sense, belonged to his mother&#8217;s totem. As Bachofen proved in
his celebrated <span class="nowrap">work,<a id="FNanchor161"></a><a href="#Footnote161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
in primeval times, and among many primitive
tribes even at the present day, the &#8220;<b>mother-right</b>&#8221; (matriarchy),
founded upon purely sensual, non-individual relations,
was predominant; and only with the appearance of freer, more
spiritual, more individual relations between the sexes (though this
did not necessarily involve the development of monogamy) was
&#8220;mother-right&#8221; first superseded by &#8220;father-right&#8221; (patriarchy).</p>

<p>These recent ethnological researches have proved the untenability
of Westermarck&#8217;s criticism of the doctrine of promiscuity;
it is no longer possible to doubt the fact of a primitive sex-companionship,
taking the form of a more or less limited promiscuity
of sexual intercourse. Ludwig Stein also lays stress on
this <span class="nowrap">view.<a id="FNanchor162"></a><a href="#Footnote162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span>
The sexual relationships of the primeval hordes were
either quite unregulated, or regulated only to a very small extent.</p>

<p>In this view of the matter there is nothing in any sense degrading
to the human race; on the contrary, in the development of<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
individual, enduring relationships between man and woman out
of a condition of primitive promiscuity, we see manifested a continuous
progression from lower to higher social forms of the
sexual relationships, a gradual improvement and ennoblement of
these relationships, until the development of monogamic marriage
(which even to-day is merely an ideal state, since the
reality does not correspond to it, or the original pure idea has been
falsified and obscured).</p>

<p>The transition from matriarchy, resting on a purely natural
basis, in which women assumed a leading social position, and
often also a leading political position, to patriarchy, in which
the spiritual and the individual relationships were brought into
the foreground, signified a great step forward in the developmental
history of marriage. Bachofen was the first to recognize
the profound importance in the history of civilization and for
the spiritual and social life of humanity of this transition of the
mother-right to the father-right, from matriarchy to patriarchy.
Schurtz found the following formula to express the change:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Woman is the central point of the natural groups arising from
sexual intercourse and reproduction; man, on the other hand, is the
creator of free forms of society based upon the sympathy of like
kinds.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The development of the individual personal marriage is most
intimately dependent upon patriarchy. In this sense, but only
in this sense, Eduard von Mayer is right when he points to man
as the true creator of the family. For under the matriarchal
system the &#8220;family&#8221; was incomplete: it consisted only of mother
and child. Only with the development of patriarchy could the
family become a complete whole. This patriarchal family, which
is also our modern family, is thus &#8220;the masculine form of the
human tendency to social
<span class="nowrap">aggregation.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor163"></a><a href="#Footnote163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The father-right consisted in the right of the father over the
wife and her children; it was a right of domination acquired by
a severe struggle. The <b>rape of women</b> and <b>marriage by capture</b>
belong to the beginnings of patriarchy; later, when woman,
completely enslaved, had fallen to the position of a mere chattel,
<b>marriage by purchase</b> was introduced. The debased position
of women under the domination of the primitive father-right can
be best studied among the Greeks, where free sexual relationships
were possible only in connexion with hetair&aelig; and the love of boys.
To the Greeks of classical antiquity the love of boys was precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
that which to the modern civilized man hetero-sexual love is,
resting upon the most personal, most individual, most spiritual
contact and understanding.</p>

<p>Kohler has beautifully described the bright side of the complete
and unrestricted father-right:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Now for the first time the man founds his home; he is the master
of the domestic herd, he is the priest of sacrifice at the domestic altar;
his ancestors are present in the spirit; he honours them; the house
is permeated by them. In his house nothing unclean shall exist;
he teaches the children propriety and dependence on the family; and
the wife, at the moment when, as a bride, she crosses the threshold of
her husband&#8217;s house, or is carried across it, gives up her household
gods; his home is now her home. Now, at the domestic hearth, the
virtues flourish&mdash;those virtues which become the preliminaries of
national greatness. In the bosom of his family the man gains power,
which fits him for the most important functions, whether in the life
of the State or in the life of science; and a township or an agricultural
community based upon such conditions constitutes the
necessary foundation upon which to erect the structure of ethical,
scientific, and political life. The wife passes into the background,
but in the house she develops new virtues; self-sacrifice to the family,
a domestic sense, joy in the home, amiability in narrower circles, are
the bright sides of her influence, for the wife knows how to develop
everywhere beautiful traits of character, so long as her lot is not cast
amidst rude or degenerating conditions.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The most ancient form of marriage under the father-right was
polygamy, as, for example, we find it described in the Old
Testament. Here we have a typical picture of the patriarchal
order of family. The head of the house and of the family has
a principal wife for the procreation of legitimate issue, but, in
addition, numerous concubines. Among the Jews, the great
stress laid upon father-right gave rise to the so-called &#8220;<b>Leviratsehe</b>&#8221;&mdash;that
is to say, a widowed wife was compelled to marry
the brother of her deceased husband, in order that the race of
the dead man should be continued. Out of this patriarchal
polygamy there gradually arose <b>monogamic</b> marriage, which
down to the present time&mdash;let us insist on the matter once
for all&mdash;has remained an ideal, never in reality attained, either
by the Greeks or Romans or in the modern civilized world. For
the modern civilized marriage is mainly a production of the
father-right, and stands under the dominion of &#8220;man-made&#8221;
morality, which, beside monogamy, legally established and
assumed to be binding, tolerates &#8220;facultative polygamy&#8221;;
hence <b>there is here concealed an element of lying and hypocrisy
which has rightly brought into discredit the modern patriarchal
marriage as a conventional form among those who regard as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
true ideal of marriage in the future the enduring life in common
of two free personalities endowed with equal rights</b>.</p>

<p>Hegel, in his celebrated definition of
<span class="nowrap">marriage,<a id="FNanchor164"></a><a href="#Footnote164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span> which he
regards as the embodiment of the reality of the species and as the
spiritual unity of the natural sexes brought about by self-conscious
love, as legal-moral love, has not done justice to the
recognition and development of the individuality of <b>both</b> parties.
The &#8220;unity,&#8221; the &#8220;one body and one soul,&#8221; corresponds indeed
to the patriarchal conception, according to which the woman is
completely absorbed into the man; it does not correspond,
however, to the modern idea of individual marriage, in which
both man and woman are united as free personalities. This, as
we shall see later, is the meaning of the struggle for &#8220;free-love,&#8221;
which must not be confused, as, for example, it is confused by
Ludwig Stein (&#8220;Beginnings of Civilization,&#8221; p. 110), with the
free-love, the hetairism, of ancient times, or with the simple
extra-conjugal intercourse of the present day.</p>

<p><b>Neither the mother-right alone, nor the father-right alone, is
competent to satisfy the ideals of modern civilized human beings,
in respect of the configuration of the social forms of the amatory
life.</b> This is only possible when both forms of right are united
in a new form, by equal rights given to both
<span class="nowrap">sexes.<a id="FNanchor165"></a><a href="#Footnote165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence, in association with the endeavour for the free individual
development of the feminine nature, we find also the tendency
to reintroduce into public life, into true valuation and honour,
the ancient conception of the mother-right.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Slowly and gradually,&#8221; says Kohler, &#8220;has the reawakened idea
of the mother-right been gnawing with a sharp tooth, now in one way,
now in another, at the rigid fetters of this system, and has loosened
them.... <b>That in this manner woman will attain a worthier position
is certain.</b> But the unitary family-sense has long ceased among us
to be the powerful incentive to action that it is among the purely
agnate (patriarchal) peoples.... Our own conditions render it possible
that the institutions of civilization will continue to thrive, even
though the family tie is no longer tense and exclusive.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The modern civilized man can quietly accustom himself to the
idea that the old patriarchal family under the dominion of the
father-right will gradually disappear; and that at the same time
the patriarchal conventional marriage of ancient times, still to<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
all appearance so firmly established, will be replaced by other,
freer forms. The idea of marriage, and its value as a form of
social life, remains meanwhile unaffected. It is possible to be a
critic of the old, outlived form of marriage, without therefore
being exposed to the suspicion of wishing to dispense with the
idea of &#8220;marriage&#8221; altogether. The one-sided, juristic, political,
sacramental, and ecclesiastical conception of the past does justice
neither to the social nor to the individual significance of marriage.
He who, like Westermarck, regards monogamic marriage as
something primitively ordained, as if it were a biological fact, and
denies completely the <b>development</b> of that institution out of
lower forms, denies also the possibility of any extensive transformation
of the existing forms of marriage. The common
mistake is, to place on the one hand monogamy in its most ideal
form, that of life-long marriage, and on the other hand, the so-called
&#8220;free love,&#8221; understanding by free love completely unregulated
extra-conjugal sexual intercourse. It is not a matter for
surprise that, in respect of both of these extreme forms of sexual
relationship, a pessimistic view should easily gain ground. According
to the point of view, one party will insist on the intolerable
character, in relation to the need for individual freedom and as
regards the development of personality, of a lifelong marriage
of duty; whilst the other party will lay stress upon the equally
great, if not greater, dangers of the unrestrained practice of extra-conjugal
sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>With regard to recent views on the marriage problem, the
reader will do well to consult the thoughtful pamphlet of Gabriele
Reuter, &#8220;The Problem of Marriage&#8221; (Berlin, 1907). The author
points out that there is a &#8220;deep-lying dissatisfaction with the
existing marriage conditions, a yearning and restless need for
improvement.&#8221; In marriage, she holds, the bodily and spiritual
process of human development is completed in the most concentrated
manner. As a cause of the numerous unhappy marriages
of our time, she points to the divergencies, so widely manifest at
the present day, between modes of thought and views of life
among members of the same strata of society and among those
of the same degree of education, more especially in religious
matters, and she refers also to experiments made in respect of
new modes of life, such as the woman&#8217;s movement. According
to Gabriele Reuter, the child will become the regulator of all the
changes in the married state which we have to expect in the
future. As &#8220;marriage,&#8221; she defines that earnest union between
man and woman which is formed for the purpose of a life in<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
common, and with the intention of procreating and bringing up
children, and she regards it as altogether beside the question
whether that union has been affected with or without civil or
ecclesiastical sanction. In contrast with this idea of &#8220;marriage,&#8221;
there would be other fugitive or more enduring unions, serving
only for excitement and sensual enjoyment. It is interesting to
note that the author recommends to the modern woman &#8220;good-humoured
and motherly forbearance&#8221; in respect of marital
infidelity. For a woman&#8217;s own good and for that of her children,
it is more important that her husband should show her love,
respect, and friendship, than that he should preserve unconditional
physical faithfulness. But the author here ignores the possibility
of venereal infection as a result of occasional unfaithfulness,
which very seriously threatens the well-being of the wife and the
children! Very wisely she advises a facilitation of divorce. This
would not make husband and wife careless in their relations one
to the other; on the contrary, it would make both more careful
and thoughtful in the avoidance of anything causing pain to one
another. The children should always remain with the mother
up to the age of fourteen years. A detailed and valuable account
of the problems of modern marriage will be found also in the
work &#8220;Regarding Married Happiness: the Experiences, Reflections,
and Advice of a Physician&#8221; (Wiesbaden, 1906).</p>

<p>Fortunately, by the legal introduction of <b>civil marriage</b> and
of <b>divorce</b> the necessity has now been recognized by the State
of leaving open for many persons a middle course&mdash;one which lies
<b>between</b> lifelong marriage (whose sacramental character is thus
abandoned) and free extra-conjugal sexual intercourse, <b>and yet
maintains the tendency towards the ideal of monogamic marriage</b>.</p>

<p>The principle of divorce forms the most important foundation
at once for a future reformation of marriage, and for a rational
view, one doing equal justice to the interests of society and those
of the individual, of the relations between man and wife. By the
introduction of divorce, the State itself has recognized the purely
personal character of conjugal relations, and has admitted that
circumstances arise in which the marriage ceases to fulfil its aims
and becomes injurious to both parties. <b>Thus the State has proclaimed
the rights of the individual personality in the married
state.</b></p>

<p>In the marriage problem, the so-called &#8220;<b>duplex sexual
morality</b>&#8221; also plays an important part&mdash;that is to say, the idea
that man is by nature inclined to polygamy, but woman to
monogamy. Herein, indeed, the thoroughly correct idea was<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
dominant that the cohabitation of one woman with several men&mdash;be
it understood we refer to simultaneous cohabitation&mdash;is harmful
to the offspring. From this, however, the only permissible
inference is that for the purposes of the procreation of children
and of racial hygiene &#8220;monogamy&#8221; can be demanded of woman
on rationalistic grounds&mdash;that is to say, the intercourse of woman
should be restricted to a single man during such a time and for
such a purpose. But it is not legitimate from these considerations
to deduce the necessity of permanent &#8220;monandry&#8221; for woman.</p>

<p>I will consider this question somewhat more exactly, and in
doing so will refer to the interesting essay of Rudolph Eberstadt
on &#8220;The Economic Importance of Sanitary Conditions&#8221; in
relation to marriage, being the concluding chapter of &#8220;Health
and Disease in Relation to Marriage and the Married State,&#8221;
by Senator and Kaminer (Rebman, 1906), because here we find
a very clear recognition of the confusion between monogamy and
monandry.</p>

<p>According to Eberstadt, there are above all two things characteristic
of modern civilized marriage&mdash;in the first place, the
higher rank allotted to the husband in the married state, and, in
the second place, the increased demand for prenuptial purity
and for conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife. The husband
demands from his wife, in addition to his own mastership in the
married state, also sexual continence before marriage and unconditional
fidelity during marriage. But the husband does not
recognize that corresponding duties are imposed on himself.</p>

<p>This difference of judgment regarding extra-conjugal sexual
intercourse on the part of husband and wife respectively, depends
entirely upon the perfectly sound experience that <b>simultaneous</b>
cohabitation on the part of a woman with several men obscures
paternity, and therewith the foundations of the family, quite
apart from a not uncommon physical injury to the child. This
<b>natural</b> difference between man and woman, in respect of sexual
intercourse and its consequences, will always endure. A man
can simultaneously cohabit with two women without thereby
interfering with the formation of a family; but a woman cannot
with similar impunity cohabit with two men. It is possible that
the demand for the virgin intactness of the wife at the time of
marriage is based upon the old experience that by sexual intercourse,
and still more by the first conception, certain far-reaching
specific changes are induced in the feminine organism, so that the
first man impregnates the feminine being for ever in his own
sense, and even transmits his influence to children of a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span>
male progenitor. (<i>Cf.</i> in this connexion G. Lomer, &#8220;Love and
Psychosis,&#8221; p. 37.)</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is not the brutality of man,&#8221; says Eberstadt, &#8220;which has imposed
a higher responsibility upon woman; Nature herself has done
this. Nature has endowed man and woman differently in respect of
the consequences of sexual intercourse. The fruit of intercourse is
entrusted to the woman alone. Now, one who has special responsibilities
has also special duties. Certain breaches of conjugal responsibility
are more sternly condemned when committed by the man;
certain others&mdash;especially such as concern care for the offspring&mdash;are
more severely judged in the wife. The relative positions
in respect of sexual intercourse are different in man and in woman,
for reasons which are physical and inalterable. Seduction, ill-treatment,
abandonment of a wife, and adultery, are punished in the husband
by law and custom. The wife, on the other hand, loses her
honour <b>simply</b> on account of promiscuous and unregulated intercourse,
because Nature herself forbids this intercourse if the material
and spiritual tie between mother, father, and child is to persist.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In accordance with these considerations, Eberstadt holds fast
to the demand for &#8220;<b>monandry</b>&#8221; on the part of the wife; he
rejects on principle the idea of <b>sexual</b> equality between man and
wife, and relegates the progressive development of marriage
exclusively to the <b>spiritual</b> and <b>moral</b> provinces.</p>

<p>Although we recognize the general accuracy of this view, and
admit that it is based upon conditions imposed once for all by
Nature herself, still we are compelled to regard it as too narrow
and one-sided, for it completely overlooks the fact that this
demand for monandric love on the part of woman can be fulfilled
in association with a freer moulding of woman&#8217;s amatory life.
We need merely think of the often happy marriages of one woman
to <b>several</b> men&mdash;<i>nota bene</i> in temporal succession&mdash;in which
marriages perfectly healthy children have been born to different
fathers, in order to see that for the woman of the future a freer
moulding of the amatory life is also possible, though admittedly
within <b>narrower</b> limits than in the case of man. Just as the
mastership of the husband must give place to an equality of
authority on the part of husband and wife, considered as two free
personalities, so also must the &#8220;duplex morality&#8221; undergo a
revision in the sense above indicated.</p>

<p>In passing, let us remark that all those who proscribe any
kind of extra-conjugal intercourse on the part of woman, and
who love to brand as an &#8220;outcast&#8221; any woman who indulges in
it, should have their attention directed for a moment to the
tremendous fact of politically tolerated, and even legalized,
<b>prostitution</b>, which, like a haunting shadow, accompanies the<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
so-called conventional marriage&mdash;a shadow growing ever <b>larger</b>
the more strictly, exclusively, and narrowly the idea of this
&#8220;marriage&#8221; is
<span class="nowrap">conceived.<a id="FNanchor166"></a><a href="#Footnote166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The civilized ideal of marriage is the lifelong duration of the
marriage between two free, independent, mature personalities,
who share fully love and life, and by a common life-work further
their own advantage and the well-being of their children. <b>But
this rarely attained ideal of civilization in no way excludes other
forms of marriage</b>, which have a more transient and temporary
character, without thereby doing any harm either to the
individual or to society.</p>

<p>More than forty years ago Lecky, the English historian of
civilization, an investigator whom no one can blame, in respect
of the tendency of his writings, for advancing lax ideas regarding
sexual morality or for advising libertinage, expressed himself
admirably on this subject. In his &#8220;History of European Morals&#8221;
he wrote:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In these considerations, we have ample grounds for maintaining
that the lifelong union of one man and of one woman should be the
normal or dominant type of intercourse between the sexes. We can
prove that it is on the whole most conducive to the happiness, and
also to the moral elevation, of all parties. But beyond this point it
would, I conceive, be impossible to advance, except by the assistance
of a special <b>revelation</b>! <b>It by no means follows that because this
should be the dominant type, it should be the only one, or that the
interests of society demand that all connexions should be forced into
the same die.</b> Connexions, which were confessedly only for a few
years, have always subsisted side by side with permanent marriages;
and in periods when public opinion, acquiescing in their propriety,
inflicts no excommunication on one or both of the parties, when these
partners are not living the demoralizing and degrading life which
accompanies the consciousness of guilt, and when proper provision is
made for the children who are born, it would be, I believe, impossible
to prove, by the light of simple and unassisted reason, that such connexions
should be invariably condemned. It is extremely important,
both for the happiness and for the moral well-being of men, that lifelong
unions should not be effected simply under the imperious prompting
of a blind appetite. There are always multitudes who, in the
period of their lives when their passions are most strong, are incapable
of supporting children in their own social rank, and who would therefore
injure society by marrying in it, but are nevertheless perfectly
capable of securing an honourable career for their illegitimate children<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
in the lower social sphere to which these would naturally belong (!).
Under the conditions I have mentioned these connexions are not
injurious, but beneficial, to the weaker partner; they soften the differences
of rank, they stimulate social habits, and they do not produce
upon character the degrading effect of promiscuous intercourse, or
upon society the injurious effects of imprudent marriages, one or
other of which will multiply in their absence. In the immense variety
of circumstances and characters, cases will always appear in which,
on utilitarian grounds, they might seem advisable.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In ancient Rome these laxer unions were recognized by law as
a form of marriage, and this legal recognition protected them,
notwithstanding the unlimited freedom of divorce, from social
contempt and stigmatization. &#8220;Concubinage&#8221; was such a
second kind of marriage, which was thoroughly recognized
and thoroughly honourable. The <i>amica convictrix</i> or <i>uxor
gratuita</i> was neither a legitimate wife nor simply a mistress;
she had rather the position of women in our own day who have
contracted a &#8220;morganatic&#8221; marriage, a &#8220;left-handed marriage.&#8221;
The only difference was that these ancient unions were more
readily dissoluble.</p>

<p>It was the Christian dogma and the sacramental and lifelong
character of marriage which first caused the stamp of infamy
to be impressed upon all other varieties of sexual intercourse.
The religious marriage was in its very nature indissoluble;
indeed, by forbidding mixed marriages (marriages between
Christian and pagan) individual freedom was entirely prohibited.</p>

<p>In contrast with this ancient religious view, the State, by the
introduction of civil marriage, of mixed marriage (<i>vide supra</i>),
and of divorce, has been compelled to make continually greater
concessions to modern ideas, and <b>has already recognized in
principle</b> that marriages limited in duration harmonize exceedingly
well with the demands of civilization; that in general, as
Lecky maintained, the recent changes in economic conditions have
a much greater influence upon marriage and the forms of marriage
than the ecclesiastical and mystical conception of the institution.</p>

<p>Anyone who wishes to gain an insight into this very difficult
problem of modern marriage must first obtain clear views in
respect of certain peculiarities of individual human love, regarding
the intimate connexion of which with the whole process of mental
evolution we have already dealt in earlier chapters.</p>

<p>Max Nordau has written a celebrated chapter on &#8220;The Lie of
<span class="nowrap">Marriage,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor167"></a><a href="#Footnote167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>
and in the light of reality marriage is, in fact, often<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
such a lie as he describes, especially in view of the fact that not
less than 75 per cent. of modern marriages are so-called
&#8220;marriages of convenience,&#8221; and in no sense are properly
<span class="nowrap">love-marriages.<a id="FNanchor168"></a><a href="#Footnote168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is a well-known fact that these marriages of reason are
often more enduring than love-marriages. This depends upon
the nature of human love, which is by no means inalterable, <b>but
changes in accordance with the various developmental phases of
the individual, needs new incitements and new individual
relationships</b>.</p>

<p>In No. 14,919 of the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i> of Vienna, March 6, 1906,
there appeared among the advertisements a remarkable question,
which was probably directed by a betrayed or deceived lover to his
beloved:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Ewige Liebe&mdash;ewige L&uuml;ge?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Eternal Love&mdash;Eternal Lie?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>Love also, personal love, is transitory, like man himself, like
the isolated individual. It differs in the different ages of life;
it differs, too, according to its object for the time being. Eduard
von Hartmann calls love a thunderstorm, which does not discharge
in a single flash of lightning, but gradually discharges the electrical
energy in several successive flashes, and after the discharge
&#8220;there comes the cool wind, the heaven of consciousness clears
once more, and we look round astonished at the fertilizing rain
falling on the ground, and at the clouds fleeing towards the
distant horizon.&#8221;</p>

<p>All those who are well acquainted with humanity, all poets and
psychologists, are in agreement respecting the fugitive character
of youthful love. For this reason, they advise against marriage
concluded during the passion of early youth. This poetry of
love at first sight is, according to Gutzkow, the eternal <b>game of
chance</b> of our young people, in which their health, their life, and
their future go to wreck.</p>

<p>Another keen observer, Kierkegaard, in his &#8220;Diary of a
Seducer,&#8221; says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Love has many mysteries, and this first love is also a mystery, if
not the greatest. Most men in their ardent passion are as if insane;
they become engaged or commit some other stupidity, and in a moment
it is all over, and they know once more what it has cost them, what
they have lost.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span></p>

<p>And, finally, a third eminent writer on eroticism, R&eacute;tif de la
Bretonne, says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is a folly of the same kind to trust the constancy of a young
man of twenty years of age. At this age it is less a woman that one
loves than women; one is intoxicated rather by sensual phenomena
than by the individual, however lovable that individual may be.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>But to youth love is almost always no more than a beautiful
memory, a vanishing paradise. There clings to it something
imperishable, which has, however, no binding force.</p>

<p>And just as to every man the love of youth appears ideal in
character, precisely because it is not subjected to the rude considerations
of reality, so also in every subsequent love it is almost
always the <b>first beginnings</b> only in which true beauty and deep
perception are experienced.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;A thousand years of tears and pains,&#8221; Goethe makes his Stella
say, &#8220;could not counterpoise the happiness of the first glance, the
trembling, the stammering, the approach and the withdrawal, the
self-forgetfulness, the first fugitive ardent kiss, and the first gently
breathing embrace.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The eternal duration of such feelings is contradicted by an
anthropologico-biological phenomenon of human sexuality, which
I have described as &#8220;<b>the need for sexual</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>variety</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor169"></a><a href="#Footnote169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></span> Human love,
as a whole and in its individual manifestations, is dominated
and influenced by the need for change and variety. Schopenhauer
drew attention to this primordial and fundamental phenomenon
of human love; he was wrong, however, in limiting it
to the male <span class="nowrap">sex.<a id="FNanchor170"></a><a href="#Footnote170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span>
As I have already insisted, this general human
need for variety in sexual relationships is to be regarded rather
as a general <b>principle of explanation of admitted facts</b>, than as a
desirable ideal. On the contrary, in my opinion, faithfulness,
constancy, and durability in love, bring under control and
diminish this need for sexual variety, through the recognition
of the eminent <b>advances in civilization</b> by means of which the
human amatory life will be further developed and perfected in
a higher sense. But the facts of daily observation are not to be
shuffled out of existence by any kind of hypocrisy or prudery.
They must be faced and dealt with.</p>

<p>First, it is an incontestable fact that the so-called &#8220;only&#8221;
love is one of the greatest rarities; that, on the contrary, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
life of the majority of men and women a frequent repetition and
renewal of love-sentiments and love-relationships occurs. For
the most part these loves occur at successive intervals. Stiedenroth,
in his admirable &#8220;Psychology,&#8221; makes the following
remarks regarding these successive outbursts of passion and the
transitory character of the feeling of love:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Since no two human beings are precisely alike, one will at one
time love passionately one only; in succession, however, several can
be loved, and the opinion that one person only can be loved in a lifetime
originates in rare dreams regarding the ideal, of which a quite
false representation is made. An object can indeed appear which
transcends the ideal hitherto conceived; but passion does not need
a fully developed ideal for its first foundation; it needs merely that
which in the theory of the feelings has been found to be a necessary
condition of love. That every love gladly thinks itself immortal,
lies in the nature of the case, for on account of the overwhelming
character of the sensations of love, it is impossible to understand how
they can ever come to an end. Experience, however, teaches us the
contrary, and insight enables us to recognize the
<span class="nowrap">reason.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor171"></a><a href="#Footnote171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Regarding the frequent occurrence of several love-passions
on the part of the same person, there can be two opinions; but
is it possible that anyone can <b>simultaneously</b> be in love with
several individuals? I answer this question with an unconditional
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; and I agree fully with Max Nordau when he
explains that it is possible to love at the same time several
individuals with almost identical tenderness, and that it is not
necessarily lying when ardent passion for each of them is
<span class="nowrap">expressed.<a id="FNanchor172"></a><a href="#Footnote172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>It is precisely the extraordinarily manifold spiritual differentiation
of modern civilized humanity that gives rise to the
possibility of such a simultaneous love for two individuals. Our
spiritual nature exhibits the most varied colouring. It is difficult
always to find the corresponding complements in one single
individual.</p>

<p>I ask those who are well acquainted with modern society if
they have not met men, and women also, who had advanced so
far in the adaptation of their love-needs to the anatomical
analysis of their psychical life, that for the romantic, realistical,
&aelig;sthetic traits of their nature, for the lyrical or dramatic moods
of their heart, they demanded correspondingly <b>different</b> lovers;
and if these several lovers should encounter each other, and be
angry with one another, the one who loved them both (or all)<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
would be inclined to cry out in naive astonishment, like the
heroine in Gutzkow&#8217;s &#8220;Seraphine,&#8221; &#8220;Love one another! love
one another! You are all one, one&mdash;<b>in me</b>!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the romance &#8220;Leonide,&#8221; by Emerentius Sc&auml;vola, the heroine
is at the same time the wife of two husbands. Reality also is
familiar with double love of this kind&mdash;for example, in the
relationship of the Princess Melanie Metternich to her husband,
the celebrated statesman, and to her previous bridegroom, Baron
<span class="nowrap">H&uuml;gel.<a id="FNanchor173"></a><a href="#Footnote173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span>
Especially frequent is the gratification of higher ideal
needs and of the simple natural impulse, by means of two different
persons. A man can love at the same time a woman of genius
and a simple child of Nature. In the novel &#8220;Double Love&#8221;
(1901), Elisar von Kupffer describes the simultaneous love of
a learned man for his extremely intelligent wife and for a buxom
servant-girl. A well-known example is also the double love of
Wieland&mdash;the ideal love for Sophie Laroche, the frankly sensual
love for Christine Hagel. But not only do differences of culture,
of position, of character, play a part in such multiple love; the
simple difference also of bodily appearance may lead to such
simultaneous attractions; for example, a man may love at the
same time a brunette and a blonde, an elegant little sylph and a
distinguished presence. This is, however, on the whole, much rarer
than simultaneous attraction to two different spiritual varieties.</p>

<p>Such facts as these are not to be employed so much in advocacy
of the multiplication of love-relationships as for the illustration
of the enormous difficulty in obtaining complete harmony between
human beings, between one man and one woman. There remains
always a balance of yearning, which the other does not fulfil;
always a balance of striving, which the other is unable to understand.
This cannot, however, affect in the slightest degree the
ideal of the <b>single love</b>; on the contrary, it makes it stand out all
the more brilliantly before our spiritual vision. It is rare, like
every ideal, and attainable only by few. This rarity of <b>complete</b>
love between a man and a woman is dwelt on also by Henry
Laube in his novel &#8220;Die Maske,&#8221; in which he describes love in all
its manifoldness and modern distraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span></p>

<p>Schleiermacher described very strikingly the necessity that
exists for the repetition and manifoldness of love-perceptions:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says he, &#8220;should it be different with love from what it is
in every other matter? Is it possible that that which is the highest
in mankind should be brought at the first time, by the most elementary
activity, to a perfect conclusion in a single deed? Should we expect
it to be easier than the simple art of eating and drinking, which the
child first attempts, and attempts again and again, with unsuitable
objects and rude experimentation, and with results which, contrary
to his deserts, are not always unfortunate? In love, also, there is
need for <b>preliminary experiments</b>, leading to no permanent result,
from which, however, every one carries away something, <b>in order to make
the feeling more definite and the prospect of love greater and</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>grander</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor174"></a><a href="#Footnote174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Georg Hirth also shows that true mastery of love only becomes
possible by means of repetition. There are ideal masculine and
feminine Don Juan natures, which are always searching for the
genuine, eternal, only love; as, for example, Wilhelmine Schr&ouml;der-Devrient,
wandering perpetually from man to man; or a similar
figure, the titular heroine of the romance &#8220;Faustine,&#8221; by the
Countess Ida Hahn-Hahn. Many, most indeed, of such never
learn to know true love, because they never find the proper
object of love; and they die, as Rousseau, in his &#8220;Confessions,&#8221;
says so strikingly, without ever having loved, eternally torn by
the need for love, without ever having been able perfectly to
satisfy that need. Happy indeed are those like Karoline, who
in Schelling found at length the man whose powerful personality
fully corresponded to her idea of love.</p>

<p>The need for such a great and true love remains fixed, notwithstanding
all deceptions, bitternesses, and the sorrows of
unsatisfied longing. Love is, in fact, the human being himself;
like the human being, love has its development, its impulse towards
higher things, towards that which is better. No painful
experience can completely annihilate love, and the need for love.
In a beautiful stanza a French poet of the eighteenth century,
the Chevalier de Bonnard, has described this essential permanency
of love:</p>

<p>True love is the product of the ripest development; it is therefore
rare, and comes late. For this reason, as Nietzsche points out,
the time for marriage comes much earlier than the time for
love. It is by means of spiritual relationships that love first
becomes enduring. Its prolongation is almost always effected
only by an enlargement and variation of psychical relationships.
Physical relationships alone soon lose through habituation the
stimulus of novelty; whence we explain the fact that so many
husbands, notwithstanding the physical beauty of their wives,
become unfaithful to them, often in favour of much uglier women,
of girls of the lower classes, or even of prostitutes. The de Goncourts
remark in their &#8220;Diary&#8221; that the beauty which in a
<i>cocotte</i> a man will reward with 100,000 francs, will not in his own
wife seem worth 10,000 francs&mdash;in the wife whom he has married,
and who, with her dowry, has brought him this magnificent
beauty into the bargain. For this reason, a priest, when a wife
complained to him that her husband had begun to get somewhat
cold in his manner to her, gave the following by no means bad
advice: &#8220;My dear child, the most honourable wife must have
in her just a suspicion of the demi-mondaine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The greatest danger for love, a danger which therefore makes
its appearance above all in married life, is the danger of
<b>habituation</b>. This has a double effect. On the one hand, by
the mere monotony of eternal repetition, love may become
blunted.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is worth remarking,&#8221; says Goethe, &#8220;that custom is capable of
completely replacing passionate love; it demands not so much a
charming, as a comfortable object; given that, it is invincible.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p class="noindent">In the second place, however, custom contradicts the already
mentioned need for variety, the eternal uniformity of daily
companionship puts love to sleep, damps its ardour, and even
gives rise to a sense of latent or open hatred between a married
pair. This hatred is observed most frequently in
<span class="nowrap">love-matches,<a id="FNanchor175"></a><a href="#Footnote175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span>
precisely because here the ideal is all the more cruelly disturbed
by the rude grasp of realities; especially if the intimate life in
common enfolds a human, all-too-human, element, and tears away
the last ideal veil. With justice the common bedroom of a
married couple has been called &#8220;the slaughter of love.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span></p>

<p>A further cause of unhappy marriages is to be found in
unfavourable age-relations of the married couple. The most
serious is the premature entrance upon marriage.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the Civil Code, the age of nubility
in the German Empire was attained, in the male sex, with the
completion of the twentieth, in the female sex with the completion
of the sixteenth year of life. In Prussia a Minister of Justice
could give permission to marry at an even earlier age. According
to the Civil Code, men could not marry until they were of full age
(twenty-one), and women, as before, not until they were sixteen
years of age. Women are able to obtain remission from this
restriction, but not men. In special cases, however, a man is
enabled to marry before the age of twenty-one years if the Court
of Wardship (<i>cf.</i> the English Court of Chancery) declares him
to be of full age, which the Court has power to do at any time
after he is eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>Whilst, before the year 1900, on the average, there were not as
many as 300 men under twenty years who annually contracted
marriage with the permission of the Minister of Justice&mdash;already
a matter for serious consideration&mdash;since the introduction of the
new Code, by which the ordinary age of nubility for man is raised
by one year, <b>the number of persons prematurely contracting
marriage has exhibited a notable increase</b>. In the year 1900 there
were 1,546, and in the year 1901 actually 1,848 young men
married before the age of twenty-one years. These very early
marriages were distributed among all professions, and almost all
classes of the population.</p>

<p>This increase in premature marriages is, speaking generally, a
symptom indicative of the premature awakening of sexuality in
our own time, a phenomenon which we shall discuss more fully
later. Such an occurrence as the elopement of a girl aged fourteen
with a boy aged fifteen, the pair having already for some time
been engaged in an intimate love-relationship, and having finally
come to the conclusion that they could no longer live apart, is by
no means a great <span class="nowrap">rarity.<a id="FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span>
No detailed argument is needed to
show that persons completely wanting mental and moral maturity
are not suited for marriage, which can only be regarded as offering
some security for endurance and life happiness, when it is the
union of two fully-developed personalities. In this respect it
seems to me that the regulations of the Civil Code are not at
present sufficiently strict.</p>

<p>A second notable factor in the causation of unhappy marriages<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
is an excessive <b>difference between the ages</b> of husband and wife,
and in this respect it is quite an old experience, that a marked
excess of age on the part of the husband has a less unfavourable
influence than a similar excess on the part of the wife. This observation
harmonizes with the fact that men can preserve sexual
potency up to the most advanced age&mdash;even in a centenarian
active spermatozoa have been
<span class="nowrap">found<a id="FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>&mdash;that such old men can
have complete sexual intercourse, and can procreate children;
whereas in women, at the age of forty-five to fifty years, with the
cessation of menstruation the procreative capacity is extinguished,
though not, indeed, the capacity for sexual intercourse and for
voluptuous sensation. Naturally, in this connexion we are not
alluding to quite abnormal cases, such as a premature impotence
in the husband, or other morbid conditions in either husband or
wife. We are considering merely the normal physical difference
in age. Metchnikoff lays great stress upon this physical disharmony
between husband and wife. He insists upon the fact
that in the man sexual excitability generally begins much earlier
than in woman, and that at a time when the woman stands at the
acme of her needs the sexual activity in the man has already begun
to decline; but this is only the case when the husband was
notably older than the wife when the marriage was contracted.
A difference of five or ten years in this respect is a small matter;
but a difference of ten or twenty years may be of serious significance.
Generally speaking, in the case of marriages which are
intended to be of lifelong duration, the difference of age should
never exceed ten years.</p>

<p>With increasing civilization, the average age at marriage has
continually advanced (in Western Europe the average age at
marriage is for men twenty-eight to thirty-one years, and for
women twenty-three to twenty-eight years), whilst the number of
persons who do not marry until late in life, and of those who do not
marry at all, is continually increasing. This is partly the result
of spiritual differentiation and of the ever-increasing difficulty in
finding a suitable life-partner, and partly it is the result of the
increasing economic difficulty in providing for the support of a
household.</p>

<p>Schmoller has calculated that under normal conditions
about 50 per cent.&mdash;one-half, that is to say&mdash;of the population
of the country must be either married or widowed. In
Europe, however, a much smaller proportion is in this condition.
Thus, taking only persons over fifty years of age, in Hungary<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
3 per cent., in Germany 9 per cent., in England 10 per cent.,
in Austria 13 per cent., in Switzerland 17 per cent., were unmarried.</p>

<p>The number of married and widowed persons among those over
fifty years of age varies in the different countries between 56 per
cent. (in Belgium) and 76 per cent. (in Hungary). In England, in
the years 1886 to 1890, the number was 60 per cent., in Germany
61 per cent., in the United States 62 per cent., in France 64 per
cent. If we enumerate the married only, excluding the widowed,
we find 8 or 10 per cent. fewer. When we compare the number
of married with the entire population, we find, instead of the
above-mentioned 50 per cent., no more than 37 to 39 per cent.
And this percentage appears likely to undergo a continual further
decline. We must, at any rate, in the future reckon with this fact,
although, of course, isolated oscillations in the marriage frequency
may continue to occur. In these oscillations <b>economic</b> and
<b>domestic</b> factors play a great part.</p>

<p>It is, however, quite erroneous to regard our own time as one
especially characterized by &#8220;<b>mercenary marriages</b>,&#8221; one in which
the union between man and wife has become a simple affair of
commerce. There are not wanting reformers who attribute to
mammonism all the blame for the disordered love-life of the
present day, and who describe very vividly and dramatically
Amor&#8217;s dance round the golden calf.</p>

<p>The facts of the history of civilization and folk-lore completely
contradict the view that this mammonistic character of marriage
is a product of our modern civilization. It is, on the contrary,
a <b>vestige</b> of early primitive civilization, in which economic factors
always had a far greater importance for marriage than spiritual
sympathies. Thus, Heinrich Schurtz proves that among the
majority of savage races marriage is rather an affair of business
than of inclination. And where are money marriages more frequent
than they are among our sturdy German peasants,
with whom everything conventional has the freest possible
<span class="nowrap">play?<a id="FNanchor178"></a><a href="#Footnote178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>It is first the higher, refined spiritual civilization which brings
with it a higher conception of marriage as the realization of the
ideal, individual only-love. As Ludwig Stein justly remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It was not in our own time that marriage first began to degenerate
to the level of an economic idea. The converse, indeed, is true; the
economic background of marriage, as it so clearly manifests itself
among savage races, <b>first began to disappear in the course of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
development of our own system of civilization, and therewith
began also the liberation of mankind from the burden of metallic</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>shackles</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor179"></a><a href="#Footnote179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p class="blankbefore1">At the same time, it cannot be denied that even at the present
day the economic factor plays a very extensive part in the determination
of marriage, although certainly not to the degree maintained
by Buckle, who held that there was a fixed and definite
relationship between the number of marriages and the price of
<span class="nowrap">corn.<a id="FNanchor180"></a><a href="#Footnote180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span>
Beyond question, economic considerations have a great
influence upon the frequency of marriage. Many marriages, even
to-day, are purely mercenary marriages; but still at the present
time the qualities of intellect and emotion, quite apart from
physical characteristics, have at least an equal share in the
production of marriage. Only among the classes who feel it
their duty to keep up a particular kind of appearance, among the
upper-middle classes, the aristocracy, and among officers in the
army, is the economic question the main determining influence in
marriage. Well known, also, is the predominance of mercenary
marriages among the Jews.</p>

<p>One may be an enemy of mammonism, and still see the
necessity for an economic regulation of conjugal relations in view
of the expected offspring, of the altered conditions of life, of the
increase in the household, and of the necessity for safeguarding
personal independence and free development. Such economic
considerations can harmonize perfectly with the demand for
personal sympathy, and with the most intimate physical and
spiritual harmony between husband and wife.</p>

<p>Schmoller rightly places the most important advance of the
modern family in this, that it becomes more and more transformed
from a productive and business institute into an institute of
moral life in common; that by the <b>limitation</b> of its economic
purposes the nobler ideal must become more predominant, and
the family become a richer soil for the cultivation of sympathetic
<span class="nowrap">sentiments.<a id="FNanchor181"></a><a href="#Footnote181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>More especially among the upper classes of modern European
and American society is there apparent an increasing disinclination
to marriage, or, to employ a phrase of the moral statistician
Drobisch, there is a decline in the intensity of the marriage
impulse. Although the often burning money question no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span>
plays its part, that part is, on the whole, much smaller than the
part played by the ever-increasing difficulties of individual
spiritual harmony, difficulties dependent on differences in age,
character, education, views of life, and individual development
during marriage. This disinclination to marry is nourished by
certain tendencies of the time to be subsequently described, and
by certain changes in the relations between the sexes.</p>

<p>To many also the idea of &#8220;<b>conjugal rights</b>,&#8221; as established by
law, appears a horrible compulsion, an assignment to physical and
spiritual prostitution. The modern consciousness of free personality,
in fact, no longer harmonizes with that stoical conception
of duty in marriage such as, for example, is described by
B. Chateaubriand in his memoirs, although, of course, every one
who enters on marriage ought to be aware that by doing so he
assigns to the other party certain rights, the non-fulfilment of
which actually destroys the character and the idea of marriage.
Thus, the conduct of a schoolmistress of Berlin, who persistently
refused physical surrender to her husband, on the ground that she
had wished merely to contract an &#8220;ideal&#8221; marriage (of the same
kind as the mystical &#8220;reformed marriage&#8221; of the American
woman Alice Stockham), demands emphatic condemnation.
But an abominable <b>misuse</b> of &#8220;conjugal rights&#8221; is unquestionably
made by inconsiderate husbands, who demand from their wives
unlimited, excessively frequent, gratification of their sexual
desire, without any regard to the wife&#8217;s physical and spiritual
condition at the time. That in this respect the idea of &#8220;conjugal
rights&#8221; is greatly in need of revision has been convincingly proved
by Dorothee Goebeler in an essay entitled &#8220;Conjugal Rights,&#8221;
published in the <i>Welt am Montag</i> of August 6, 1906.</p>

<p>Too frequently, also, it happens that the husband simply
transfers into his married life previous customs of extra-conjugal
sexual intercourse, and makes use in marriage of the experience
he has gained in intercourse with prostitutes or with priestesses
of the love of the moment; he treats his wife as an object of sensual
lust, without paying any regard to her individuality and to her
more delicate erotic needs.</p>

<p>This physical dissonance is not even the worst. Too often it is
simply boredom which kills love in married life. Like Nora
in &#8220;A Dolls&#8217; House,&#8221; one waits for the &#8220;wonderful,&#8221; and the
wonderful does not happen. Instead of this the years pass by;
sexual passion, greatly influenced as it is by the spiritual environment,
gradually disappears, and with it disappears also the last
possibility of spiritual sympathy. Thus, the character of most<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
marriages is <b>solitude</b>. They represent the tragedy of desolation,
of the eternal self-seeking of husband and wife.</p>

<p>What disastrous consequences, finally, may result from the
part played in marriage by <b>disease</b>, what tragic conflicts may here
rise, can be studied in the great book &#8220;Health and Disease in
Relation to Marriage and the Married State&#8221; (Rebman, 1906),
an encyclop&aelig;dic work edited by H. Senator and S. Kaminer,
discussing in detail the relation between disorders of health and
the married state.</p>

<p>The calamities of modern marriage are strikingly illuminated
in the following psychologically interesting account given by
the alienist Heinrich Laehr (&#8220;Concerning Insanity and Lunatic
Asylums,&#8221; p. 44 <i>et seq.</i>; Halle, 1852):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;How, as a matter of fact, do marriages come about? In heaven
certainly a very small number indeed, if by that phrase we understand
marriages undertaken with the full understanding of the nature
of the sacrifice involved, under the impulsion of an inner necessity,
and based upon deep mutual inclination founded upon self-respect
and respect for each other; in social circles, and not in heaven, on the
other hand, the majority of marriages are made. The question upon
which ultimately so many marriages depend is, what each will gain
by it, whilst inner sensations and mutual liking are regarded as subordinate
matters.... A man is fully informed about such matters
in early years; a woman is full of dark perceptions, uncertain as to
what she is to receive and what she is to give. She is naturally impelled
by her sense of inward weakness to yield to anyone more powerful
than herself, and, in the intoxication of sensual excitement, under
conditions in which both, in order to please, tend to show the best
side only to each other, she is far less able than man to weigh beforehand
the significance of such a step. Later, indeed, when, in the
trodden path of marriage, the current of love runs more slowly, her
eyes are opened, naked reality takes the place of the pictures of
imagination, which formerly caused self-deception, and what appeared
to be love, but was not love, takes flight for ever. What has not
been hidden under the name of love! It conceals the pretence of
egoistic impulses, vanity it may be, the life of pleasure, avarice, indolence;
and what a number of marriages are entered into on the part
of the woman in order to escape from the oppression of repugnant
domestic conditions, because the imagined future appears to them more
pleasant in contrast with the actual present.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are in the course of marriage so many periods of misunderstood
depression, sadness, trouble; and mankind so readily forgets
the golden rule, that these periods have to be got through by means
of mutual aid, and that in married life husband and wife should do
all that is possible to help one another onwards, and not to thrust
one another back&mdash;so easily is this forgotten, that only too readily
the mirth and gladness with which married life was begun vanish
away. The intense pain which attacks us with violence, but only
at long intervals, has a far less depressing influence on our organism<span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span>
than much less severe, but frequently repeated, emotional disturbances,
especially such as arise out of the wretchedness of life. They give rise
in us to irritability of the nervous system, by which sensitiveness is
increased; and repeated misunderstandings in married life soon make
both husband and wife feel that marriage is rather a burden than a joy.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>That women as well as men recognize the danger to love
entailed by marriage is shown by Frieda von B&uuml;low in &#8220;Einsame
Frauen,&#8221; pp. 93, 94 (1897):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;During this period I have often considered the question of such
continued life in common. Is it not inevitable that this unceasing,
intimate association must always give rise to mutual hatred?
Husband and wife learn to know one another through and through.
The veil of white lies which plays so important a part in ordinary
social intercourse is here impossible. The characters are seen naked
in all their weakness, all their incapacity for love, all their vanity, all
their egoism. In such circumstances, phrases intended to conceal
appear simply untruths, and instead of producing illusion they repel.
Just as in the first awakening of love, all the powers of the soul are
directed towards the discovery of the excellences of the beloved one,
so here the soul is for ever upon a voyage of discovery seeking for faults.
In both cases alike, a sufficiency of that which one seeks is found.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poets also give us an insight into the depths of the eternal
contradiction between love and marriage. Who does not know
the saying of the idealistic and optimistic Schiller: &#8220;Mit dem
G&uuml;rtel, mit dem Schleier reisst der sch&ouml;ne Wahn entzwei&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;With
the girdle, with the veil (of marriage), the beautiful
illusion is torn to pieces&#8221;? Consider, also, the horribly clear
characterization of the pessimistic Byron (in &#8220;Don Juan,&#8221;

<p>It is significant that those who most praise marriage are
young people who do not know marriage from experience, but
have failed to find true happiness in celibacy. We think of the
words of Socrates, that it is a matter of indifference whether a
man marries or does not marry, for in either case he will regret it.</p>

<p>Our own time is certainly characterized by hostility to marriage.
It is the <b>form</b> of modern marriage which frightens most
people; the compulsion which has actually been rendered more
stringent by the new Civil Code of 1900. Modern individualism
draws back from the undeniable <b>loss of freedom</b> which legal
marriage entails. The shadow which, according to a saying of
E. D&uuml;hring, indissoluble marriage has thrown upon love and upon
the nobler aspects of the sexual life, is darker to-day than ever
before.</p>

<p>Hence the growing disinclination to marry, which, significantly
enough, is increasingly manifest upon the part of women; hence,
above all, the <b>extraordinary increase in divorce</b>.</p>

<p>According to a statement in the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> (No. 137,
March 22, 1906), the number of divorces in Germany underwent
a <b>marked</b> increase in the year 1904. In that year there were
10,882 divorces; in 1903, 9,932; in 1902, 9,074; thus in the year
1904 there was an increase of 590, or 9&middot;6 per cent.</p>

<p>In the closing years of the nineteenth century, a marked
increase in the number of divorces was already discernible.
For instance, in the years 1894-1899 the number rose from<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
7,502 to 9,433. It was at that time believed that the increase
depended upon the fact that in most of the countries of the
German Confederation the new Civil Code made divorce more difficult,
and that for this reason as many people as possible were
seeking divorce before the new Code came into action. It is true
that the number of divorces diminished after the Civil Code
passed into operation. In the year 1900 the divorces numbered
7,922, and in the year 1901, 7,892. <b>Since then, however, there
has once more been a marked increase</b>, so that <b>the figure for
the year 1904 is 2,990 in excess of that for the year 1901, an
increase of 38 per cent</b>. This increase is principally to be referred
to the fact that the so-called <b>relative grounds for divorce</b>, enumerated
in &sect; 1568 of the Civil <span class="nowrap">Code,<a id="FNanchor182"></a><a href="#Footnote182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span>
appear to have justified
a great number of demands for divorce. The marked extensibility
of the sections of this paragraph leaves the judge very wide
discretion in its application.</p>

<p>To what an extent the increase in the number of divorces
influences the existing marriages is seen as soon as we compare
the number of divorces with the number of marriages. It appears
that in the years 1900 and 1901, for every 10,000 marriages,
there were 8&middot;1 divorces; in 1902, 9&middot;3 divorces; in 1903, 10&middot;1
divorces; and in 1904, 11&middot;1 divorces. Thus in the year 1904,
there were 3 more divorces per 10,000 marriages than in the
year 1901.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the enormous importance of divorce
in relation to the recognition on the part of the State of the
temporary character of every marriage, whereby, in principle,
free love, which is no more than a temporary marriage, receives
a civil justification, and is legitimized. This fact stands out
still more clearly when we recognize the legal possibility of
<b>repeated</b> divorces on the part of one and the same person. Numerous
actual examples of this can be given. Thus a well-known
author was divorced no less than <b>four</b> times, and of his four wives
one, on her side, had been divorced by other men. Two divorces
on both sides are by no means rare. If we consider the matter
openly and unemotionally, it must be admitted that this is nothing
else than the much-opposed &#8220;free love,&#8221; the bugbear of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
honest Philistines, <b>a free love which has already received the
official sanction of the State</b>.</p>

<p>When four or five divorces are possible to the same individual
by official decree, when, that is to say, this procedure has received
civil sanction, the number may for theoretical purposes be multiplied
at discretion.</p>

<p>He who knows human nature, he who knows that the consciousness
of freedom in mature human beings&mdash;and only such
should enter upon marriage&mdash;strengthens and confirms the
<b>consciousness of duty</b>&mdash;such a one need not fear the introduction
of free marriage. On the contrary, it may be assumed that
divorces would be far less common than they are in the case of
coercive marriage.</p>

<p>According to the Civil Code, divorces are obtainable on the
ground of adultery, hazard to life, malicious abandonment,
ill-treatment, mental disorder, legally punishable offences, dishonourable
and immoral conduct, serious disregard of conjugal
duties. As we saw, the last clause empowered the judge in
difficult cases, by a humane, reasonable interpretation of the
idea &#8220;disregard of conjugal duties,&#8221; to pronounce a divorce.
It is obvious that in every divorce the interests of the <b>children</b>
of the marriage (if any) must be especially safeguarded.</p>

<p>Marriage in France, to which hitherto the clauses of the Code
Napol&eacute;on, analogous to those of our Civil Code, have been applicable,
is said to have recently undergone reform, both in respect
of moral and of legal rights. In Paris there has been constituted
a standing &#8220;Committee of Marriage Reform,&#8221; composed of well-known
authors, jurists, and women, among the number being
Pierre Louys, Marcel Prevost, Judge Magnaud, Octave Mirbeau,
Maeterlinck, Henri Bataille, Henri Coulon, and Poincar&eacute;.</p>

<p>In an address to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate by
the President of this Committee, Henri Coulon, in which he
gives the reasons for desiring a change in the present marriage
<span class="nowrap">laws,<a id="FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span> he says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It would be childish to disguise the fact that the institution of
marriage has entered upon a critical phase; philosophers and novelists
lay odds on the complete disappearance of the institution. In this,
perhaps, they go too far. But it is none the less true that it is a matter
of profound interest and importance to reform the institution of
marriage. Granted this, how shall we begin?</p>

<p>&#8220;The entrance into marriage must be made as easy as possible;
in this way the number of marriages which are based upon love will
rapidly increase. Then, the married pair must have <b>equal rights,<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
equal duties</b>, and <b>equal responsibilities</b>; in this way marriage will become
more practical and less immoral than it is at present. Finally&mdash;and
this is the most important of all&mdash;it is necessary <b>to facilitate divorce</b>.
Divorce will then become the worthy separation of two thinking
beings, and will no longer be the disgusting comedy that it is at the
present day.</p>

<p>&#8220;For those determined to live apart, for those whose morals are
loose, indissoluble marriage itself is no longer a bond. Absolute
freedom is no hindrance to conjugal fidelity and constancy; on the
contrary, <b>freedom is the cause of constancy</b>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Divorce is not happiness, but it is a help towards happiness. For
two human beings who hate one another to continue to live together
is a much greater evil than divorce. Certainly it would be preferable
if husband and wife could continue to love one another as they did
during the first days of their married life; that they should love their
children and be honoured by them. But since humanity is not free
from faults and vices, this does not always happen. Divorce, as we
wish for it, makes marriage worthier and more profound. Such marriages
will be better suited to the new social movements and to the
modern spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>The civil equality of the two sexes must be a fundamental principle
of modern law.</b> The French Civil Code already recognizes for both
sexes equal rights in some respects; but the wife still loses a certain
portion of her rights in the moment that she marries. She is in
fact rendered incapable of business. The contrast between the
incapacity for business of the married woman and the capacity for
business of the unmarried is one of the characteristic traits of our
legislation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Divorce, as it now exists, contradicts the indissolubility of the
marriage bond demanded by the Church. Adultery should only be
regarded as a ground for divorce, and should not exonerate the murderer
who kills his adulterous wife or her accomplice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We demand the abolition of the punishment for adultery, because
prosecutions of this character arise either from revengeful feelings or
from litigiousness.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Justice demands that with this facilitation of divorce, as
advocated in the French scheme of marriage reform, there
should be associated <b>increased</b> security for the care of the dependent
wife and children after divorce. In this connexion, <b>conjugal
responsibility</b> is merely a part of <b>sexual responsibility</b> in general.
If two independent, free individuals have sexual relations one
with the other, in or out of marriage, they thereby both undertake
in respect of their <b>own persons</b> and of all possible <b>offspring</b>,
the duty and the responsibility which are the outcome of a
natural instinctive feeling, namely, &#8220;the sense of sexual responsibility.&#8221;
This must dominate the entire sexual life of every
human being, as a categorical imperative. In this is to be found
the necessary ethical counterpoise to the activity of boundless
sexual egoism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span></p>

<p>For the love of the future and its social regulation, the three
following conditions appear to me to be determinative; they form
a part also of the French programme of marriage reform:</p>

<p>1. <b>Equal rights, equal duties, equal responsibilities on the part
of husband and wife.</b></p>

<p>2. <b>Facilitation of divorce.</b></p>

<p>3. <b>Individual freedom to be regarded as preferable to coercion.
Freedom best promotes constancy in</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>love.</b><a id="FNanchor184"></a><a href="#Footnote184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>If these principles were strictly carried out in practical life,
without doubt, and as a matter of absolute certainty, the number
of divorces would not increase, but would diminish, and we should
sooner witness the realization of the ideal of true marriage, as the
lifelong union of two free personalities, fully conscious of their
duties and their rights.</p>

<p>The high ethical and social significance of family life will ever
continue, even under the freest love, by which, as I must again
and again insist, I do not understand unrestricted and continually
changing extra-conjugal sexual intercourse. Against this the
gravest considerations must be urged. What &#8220;free love&#8221; is, is
already apparent from the preceding exposition, but in the next
chapter the subject will be more thoroughly discussed.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX<br />
ONE HUNDRED TYPICAL MARRIAGES AND SOME CHARACTERISTIC
PICTURES OF THE MARRIED STATE, AFTER
GROSS-HOFFINGER</h3>

<p class="noindent">In a long-forgotten, but very interesting, book by Dr. Anton J.
Gross-Hoffinger, entitled &#8220;The Fate of Women, and Prostitution
in Relation to the Principle of the Indissolubility of Catholic
Marriage, and especially in Relation to the Laws of Austria
and the Philosophy of our
<span class="nowrap">Time,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor185"></a><a href="#Footnote185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span>
we find a collection, equally
interesting to psychologists and to students of human character,
to the physician, the jurist, and the sociologist, of a hundred
typical marriages, and also a more detailed description of the
course of a few marriages. These sketches deserve to be preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
from oblivion, because they will serve equally well as an example
of marriages of our time.</p>

<p>In the first place, the author discusses the principal difficulties
of marriage. He then asks whether, in view of the smallness of
the number of those comparatively happy persons who have found
it possible to live a legal and at the same time a natural family life,
the existing marriage laws, religious ideas, and social customs
have attained their aim, whether they give rise, as a general rule,
to happy and fruitful, honourable and blessed unions. The
author hesitated long before presenting for the first time &#8220;to the
Catholic world the picture of the actual state of marriages in
that world, a picture based upon numerous experiences and
observations.&#8221; He investigated one hundred marriages of persons
belonging to the most diverse classes, without selection, as they
came under his observation by chance; then, again, another
hundred, and once again a third hundred. Always the results
were equally sad; always the ratio between happy and unhappy
marriages was the same. The result of his investigations was, he
states:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Although I have earnestly sought for happy marriages, my search
has to this extent been vain, that I have never been able to satisfy
myself that <b>happy</b> marriages are anything but <b>extremely isolated
exceptions to the general rule</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In his view this is not the unhappy result of erroneous observation,
but depends upon exact observation during a long series of
years, and in conditions which brought him into intimate relationship
with numbers of persons in all classes of society.</p>

<p>Thus, after a long, difficult, and careful investigation into a
<b>hundred</b> marriages among persons of different classes, he obtained
the following results, here briefly summarized:</p>

<p>Among these hundred marriages only one was happy owing to
mutual faithfulness; all the other slightly happy marriages, if
one may call them so, were so only because the wife did not
disturb herself with regard to the question of her husband&#8217;s
faithfulness.</p>

<p>From these statistics Gross-Hoffinger draws the following
conclusions:</p>

<p>1. About <b>one-half</b> of all marriages are <b>absolutely unhappy</b>.</p>

<p>2. Much more than one-half of all marriages are obviously
<b>demoralized</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span></p>

<p>3. The morality of the remaining smaller moiety is preserved
only by avoiding questions regarding the husband&#8217;s faithfulness.</p>

<p>4. Fifteen per cent. of all marriages live on the earnings of
professional unchastity and procurement.</p>

<p>5. The number of orthodox marriages which are entirely above
every suspicion of marital infidelity (assuming the existence of
complete sexual potency) is in the eyes of every reasonable man,
who understands the demands which Nature makes, and the
violence of those demands, <b>equivalent to nil</b>. Hence the
<b>ecclesiastical</b> purpose of marriage is <b>generally</b>, <b>fundamentally</b>,
and <b>completely evaded</b>.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;No <b>compulsion</b>,&#8221; thus concludes the author, &#8220;is more unnatural
than that of the Catholic (Protestant, Jewish, Greek Orthodox)
religion, by which is prescribed a compulsory continuance of marriage,
with its fantastic code and ridiculous conjugal duties and rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all, this compulsion&mdash;this sacrament of marriage&mdash;marriage
which is nothing, can be nothing, <b>according to nature</b> should
be nothing, but <b>a free union and a civil arrangement</b>&mdash;results in the
<b>avoidance of marriage</b>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Secondly, it results that in marriage the purposes of marriage are
not and cannot be completely fulfilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirdly, that marriage has ceased to be the natural marriage which
it should be, and has become merely a business, a speculation, or a
hospital for invalids.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In illustration of this proposition, Gross-Hoffinger finally
describes from life twenty-four marriages, some of which, being
especially interesting, we will here record.</p>

<div class="samplemarriages">

<p class="counter">1.</p>

<p>Countess B., owing to unavoidable difficulties, was unable to contract
a suitable marriage, and attained the age of thirty whilst still
unmarried. The result of this was she gave herself to a servant,
consequently became infected, and died of syphilis some months after
she had, finally, married. Her husband was left with an unhappy
memorial of this brief marriage.</p>

<p class="counter">2.</p>

<p>Count C., a man of high rank, lost his beloved wife through death.
Circumstances made it impossible for him to marry again. He was
afraid of acquiring venereal disorders, and therefore abstained from
natural connexion. Through lack of natural sexual gratification his
sexual impulse became perverse, and he took to the practice of Greek
love.</p>

<p class="counter">3.</p>

<p>Prince D., young, impotent, concluded a marriage of convenience
with a beautiful, very passionate lady, who, on account of her husband&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
impotence, compensated herself with domestic servants, members
of her retinue, and cavalry soldiers, and gave birth in these conditions
to several children, which inherited the title of the putative
father. In such circumstances the marriage has been very unhappy,
but necessity compels the husband to bear his fate with patience.</p>

<p class="counter">4.</p>

<p>Count E., in other respects a man of fine character, made a marriage
of convenience with a lady of good family, who, however, was not in
a position to make him happy. From natural nobility of character,
he was unwilling to distress his unhappy wife by entering openly into
relations with a concubine, and therefore sought sexual gratification
with prostitutes. He became infected, and transmitted the illness to
his wife, who became seriously ill, and gave birth to diseased children.
Although the poor sufferer is unaware of the origin of her troubles,
and bears them with patience; although her husband takes all possible
care of her, and does his best to bring about the restoration of her
health; the marriage, owing to the uneasy conscience of the husband
and the physical suffering of the wife, is obviously a very unhappy
one.</p>

<p class="counter">5.</p>

<p>Baron F., a man of wide influence, in youth a libertine&mdash;frivolous,
and of an emotional disposition, insusceptible to finer feelings, contracted
successively four marriages of convenience, which in all cases
terminated in the death of the wife. There is reason to believe that
the unceasing libertinism and unscrupulous conduct of the husband
had shortened the life of his wives&mdash;and this is all the more probable
because all the Baron&#8217;s children are sickly and scrofulous.</p>

<p class="counter">6.</p>

<p>Count G., dissipated libertine, wasted his property in wild extravagance,
and compelled his wife to live apart from him, whilst he
spent enormous sums on professional singers and dancers and common
prostitutes. Being ruined as completely financially as physically,
he was despised by persons of all classes, persecuted by his creditors,
and absolutely detested by his wife. Although his pleasures consist
chiefly in reminiscences, he still devotes enormous sums to them, the
money being obtained by a continued increase in his debts.</p>

<p class="counter">7.</p>

<p>Count H. has been married for many years, but lives on the most
unpleasant terms with his wife, and devotes his spare time to the
society of prostitutes. The scum of the street form his favourite
associates; but his voluptuous adventures carry him also into family
life, and no respectable middle-class wife or girl, however innocent, is
safe from his advances, which are all the more incredible because he
is quite an old man and completely impotent. He uses all possible
means to make the woman of his choice compliant&mdash;presents, promises,
threats.</p>

<p>Dr. S., husband of an immoral wife, public official, libertine, philosopher,
enjoying a small secured income. Lives with his wife on a
footing which permits both parties unlimited freedom. The worthy
couple devote their whole energies to earning money by their industry,
in part by secret prostitution on the part of the wife, in part by direct
and indirect procurement by the holding of piquant evening parties
for youthful members of the aristocracy. The family has an extraordinary
vogue. Persons of high position are engaged in confidential
intercourse with them; young girls of the better classes gladly attend
their soir&eacute;es, since there they meet the &eacute;lite of the young aristocracy,
rich Jews, and officers. This interesting pair get through an almost
incredible amount of money; they keep a magnificent carriage, they
have a country house, a valuable collection of pictures, etc. It is
only from their servants that both of them receive little respect,
since the male portion of the household subserve the lustful desires
of the wife, the female domestics those of the husband, and all must
be initiated into the secrets of the household industry.</p>

<p class="counter">9.</p>

<p>Dr. U. was till recently an old bachelor, who had never wished to
share his property with a wife and children, and found it much cheaper
and more agreeable to impregnate servant-girls and other neglected
characters than to keep a mistress, or to seek his pleasures in the
street. Finally, becoming infirm at sixty-two years of age, and
needing nursing, on account of an occasional gouty swelling of the
leg, he discovered that it was not good for man to be alone. Having
rank and wealth, it would have been easy for him to find a young and
pretty girl who, under the title of wife, would have undertaken to play
the part of sick nurse. But the old practitioner knew too well the
value of what he had to offer to throw himself away on a poor girl.
He considered that it would be reasonable to choose such a partner
that he would not be obliged to divide his income, and to find some
one to take care of him in his old age who would cost him nothing at
all, but would rather provide for her own needs. He thought less,
therefore, of youth than of property, less of beauty than of thrifty
habits; and finally found an old maid, a woman with some property,
who, on account of a somewhat unattractive exterior, had failed to
obtain a husband. Now one can see the prudent husband, who is
as faithful to his wife as the gout is faithful to him, walking from time
to time in the street on the arm of his life companion, whose aspect is
somewhat discontented. She still wears the same clothes which she
wore before her marriage, and which have a sufficiently shabby appearance,
but she endures her lot with patience, because she is now greeted
as &#8220;gn&auml;dige Frau,&#8221; and people kiss her hand, as they did not do
formerly.</p>

<p class="counter">10.</p>

<p>Count J., a man of unblemished character, lived for some time a
happy married life. The increasing age of the wife, however, associated
with the exceptional constitution of the Count, whose youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
seemed remarkably enduring, led to scenes of jealousy, which embittered
the life of both. We can hardly suppose that this jealousy
is altogether unfounded; but surely it is a matter for regret that two
human beings of distinctly noble character should by marriage be
exposed to lifelong unhappiness.</p>

<p>Herr von K., a young merchant in the wholesale trade, is married
to the daughter of a man of position, and the wife by a rich dowry
helped to found her husband&#8217;s fortunes; hence she enjoys the distinction
over other wives that her husband pretends a great tenderness
for her, and conceals his indiscretions with the greatest possible care.
For this reason, she has always been devoted to him; she regards him
as the example for all other husbands, as a true phenomenon
in the midst of an utterly depraved world of immoral men. And as
an actual fact, if one sees this man, how he lives in appearance only for
his business, with what delicate modesty he avoids any conversation
about loose women, if one hears him zealously preach against husbands
who deceive their wives, how inconceivable it is to him that a
man should find any pleasure in immoral women&mdash;one would be
willing to swear that he is everything that his wife enthusiastically
describes him to be. But some wags amongst his acquaintances, by
taking incredible pains, discovered that this honourable merchant had
no less than <b>seven mistresses</b>, two of whom belonged to the class of
prostitutes, two to the class of grisettes; the remaining three had
been decent middle-class women. To these last he presented himself
under various names and in the most diverse forms&mdash;now as attach&eacute;
to an embassy, now as an officer, now as a journeyman mechanic. To
all these latter mistresses he had promised marriage, and by a succession
of presents, oaths, and lies, he had in each case attained his
end, and thereafter abandoned them without remorse to the consequences
of the adventure, whilst he himself set out to seek in a fresh
quarter of the town new sacrifices for the altar of his lusts. Since
he never had anything to do with known prostitutes and procuresses,
but by personal pains provided the materials for his pleasures, he
succeeded both as a merchant and as a husband in preserving the
reputation of a man free from illicit passion and deserving of all
confidence.</p>

<p class="counter">12.</p>

<p>Major W., a distinguished officer, a man of honour in every respect,
had in youth married a chambermaid, naturally, as one can imagine,
from pure inclination. But the marriage remained barren, because the
wife suffered from organic troubles; and soon her sexual powers were
completely extinguished. Whilst the husband still remained virile,
the wife was already an old woman, suffering from spasmodic and
other affections, surrounded always by medicine-bottles and medical
appliances, always ill-humoured and nagging, a true torment for the
good-natured and amiable husband. The latter bears with Christian
patience and inexhaustible love the ill-humour of his wife; but Nature
is less pliable than his kind heart: his conjugal tenderness diminishes,
and his ardent temperament seeks other outlets for the gratification<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
of his natural sexual desires. The sick wife notices this coolness, and
revenges herself by a refined cruelty. She knows that sulkiness on
her part makes him ill and miserable; she therefore afflicts him with
coldness of manner, and by jealousy and ill-temper she makes his life
a hell. There occur horrible scenes of domestic brawling, which more
than once have led the husband to attempt to end his troubles by
suicide. He suffers in a threefold fashion: by the continued irritation
of his healthy natural impulse, by the illnesses he contracts in gratifying
that impulse, and by the sorrows of his really loved wife. He
imposes upon himself a voluntary celibacy in order that he may not
make her ill; but this sacrifice does not suffice, it does not make his
wife gentler towards him. She demands from him, tacitly, all the
ardency of the bridegroom; there is no rescue possible from this
inferno. The husband surrenders himself to a quiet despair. He is
faithful in his vocation; he lives only for the wife, who torments him
continually. The neighbours see a very unedifying example of an
extremely unhappy marriage, originally contracted as a pure love
match, and none the less entailing martyrdom alike on husband
and wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;That in Vienna the conjugal conditions so graphically
described in the above extracts are still much the same as formerly,
and that marriage needs and marriage lies are there exceptionally
painful is shown by the foundation in Vienna of a &#8220;Society for
Marriage Reform,&#8221; which sent to the Assembly of German Jurists,
meeting at Kiel in the beginning of September, 1906, the telegraphic
request that they would undertake a revision of Austrian
marriage law, since hitherto no cure had been found for unhappy
marriage in Austria, no divorce was possible, and those who had
obtained a judicial separation could, according to Canon Law,
sue one another on account of adultery (<i>cf.</i> <i>Neue Freie Presse</i>,
No. 15108, September 13, 1906). It is hardly credible, but,
according to a report in the <i>Berlin Aerzte-Correspondenz</i>, 1907,
No. 8, it is true, that the Medical Court of Honour for the town
of Berlin and the province of Brandenburg, in the year of our
Lord 1906, punished physicians on the ground of adultery!</p>

P. N&auml;cke, one of the most trustworthy authorities on sexual anthropology,
writes as follows: &#8220;That in ancient times, before monogamy, there was polygamy,
or even a state resembling promiscuity, <b>is very probable</b> (Westermarck
notwithstanding), <b>and can, in fact, be assumed a priori</b>&#8221; (&#8220;Einiges zur Frauenfrage
und zur sexuellen Abstinenz&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;A Contribution to the Woman&#8217;s Question
and to the Problem of Sexual Abstinence&#8221;), published in the <i>Archiv f. Kriminalanthropologie</i>,
vol. xiv., p. 52 (Hans Gross, 1903). <i>Cf.</i> also Lohsing&#8217;s &#8220;Zustimmung
zur Annahme einer urspr&uuml;nglichen Promiscuit&auml;t,&#8221; <i>ibid.</i>, vol. xvi., p. 332.</p>

<p>The question of sexual promiscuity has recently been further considered by
P. N&auml;cke (&#8220;Earliest Beginnings of Human Society,&#8221; in <i>Die Umschau</i> of August 17,
1907). He believes that the state of pure promiscuity lasted a short time only,
and gave place to certain nuclei of family structure, a kind of semi-promiscuity,
which, prior to the complete development of the family union, lasted much
longer than the state of pure promiscuity. Still, these earliest families were
merely temporary, and only later became fixed and permanent. This assumption,
however, does not affect the fact of a primordial pure promiscuity. N&auml;cke
himself also recognizes promiscuity as the natural state of primitive man.</p>

gratification of her sensual needs. Contrariwise, Knut Hamsun, in &#8220;Pan,&#8221;

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class="noindent">The problem of &#8220;free love&#8221; is the burning question of our time.
Upon its proper solution depends the future of civilization, and
our ultimate liberation from the ignominious conditions of the
amatory life of the present day, dependent as these are upon
coercive marriage. This is our firm conviction, our profound
belief, one which we share with many, and those not the worst
minds of our day.</p>

<p>Free love is neither, as malevolent opponents maintain, the
abolition of marriage, nor is it the organization of extra-conjugal
sexual intercourse. Free love and extra-conjugal sexual intercourse
have nothing whatever to do one with the other. Indeed,
I go so far as to maintain that true free love, as it must and will
prevail, will limit casual and unregulated extra-conjugal sexual
intercourse <b>to a far greater extent</b> than coercive marriage has ever
succeeded in doing. Above all, free love will ennoble sexual
intercourse.</p>

<p>For the longer, in existing economic conditions, we cling to the
antiquated &#8220;coercive marriage,&#8221; which has so long been in need
of reform, the smaller is the number of those who desire to marry,
the more advanced becomes the age of marriage, the greater
becomes the general sexual wretchedness, the deeper shall we sink
into the mephitic slough of prostitution, towards which the
increasing promiscuity of extra-conjugal sexual intercourse
inevitably leads us.</p>

<p>For this is the peculiar, hypocritical, and absurd mode of
argument of those who uphold conventional marriage; they
despise and brand with infamy every sexual relationship of two
adult independent persons based upon free love, and sanction
quite openly casual transitory extra-conjugal sexual intercourse,
devoid of all personal relationships, not only with prostitutes, but
also with respectable women.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Bachelorhood,&#8221; says Max Nordau, &#8220;is very far from being equivalent
to sexual continence. The bachelor receives from society the
tacit permission to indulge in the convenience of intercourse with
woman, when and where he can; it calls his self-seeking pleasures
&#8216;successes,&#8217; and surrounds them with a kind of poetic glory; and the
amiable vice of Don Juan arouses in society a feeling composed of
envy, sympathy, and secret
<span class="nowrap">admiration.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor186"></a><a href="#Footnote186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, <b>this same</b> conventional coercive marriage
morality demands from the girl complete sexual continence and
intactness until the time of her marriage!</p>

<p>But every reasonable and just man must ask the question,
Where, then, are the unmarried men to gratify their sexual
impulse if at the same time the unmarried girls are condemned to
absolute chastity?</p>

<p>It is merely necessary to place these two facts <b>side by side</b> in
order to expose the utter mendacity and shamelessness of the
coercive marriage morality, and to display the true cancer of our
sexual life, the sole cause of the increasing diffusion of <b>prostitution</b>,
of <b>wild sexual promiscuity</b>, and of <b>venereal diseases</b>.</p>

<p>When hereafter, before the judgment-seat of history, the
dreadful &#8220;<i>j&#8217;accuse</i>&#8221; is uttered against the sexual corruption of
our time, then there will be a good defence for those of us who,
under the device, &#8220;Away with prostitution! away with the
brothels! away with all &#8216;wild&#8217; love! away with venereal
diseases!&#8221; were the first to indicate <b>free love</b> as the one and only
means of rescue from these miseries.</p>

<p>We are always told that men are not yet ready for the free,
independent management of their sexual life; mankind is not yet
ripe for the necessary responsibility. Our opponents point
especially to the danger of such an opinion and such reforms for
the lower classes.</p>

<p>But human beings are better than the defenders of the obsolete
conventional morality would have us believe, and above all, it is
the members of the lower classes whom we may quietly allow to
follow the dictates of their own hearts. They, indeed, give us
the example that freedom is not equivalent to immorality and
pleasure-seeking; that, on the contrary, it is freedom that awakens
and keeps active the consciousness of duty and the sense of
responsibility.</p>

<p>Alfred Blaschko rightly draws attention to the fact that among
the proletariat for a long time already the idea of free love has
been actually realized. In a large majority of cases men and
women of these classes have sexual intercourse with one another,
especially between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, without
<span class="nowrap">marrying.<a id="FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Among the proletariat free love has never been regarded as
sinful. Where there is no property which is capable of being left to
a legitimate heir, where the appeal of the heart draws man and woman
together, from the very earliest times people have troubled themselves
little about the blessing of the priest; and had it not been that at the
present day the civil form of marriage is so simple, whilst, on the
other hand, there are so many difficulties placed in the path of unmarried
mothers and illegitimate children, <b>who can tell if the modern
proletariat would not long ago, as far as they themselves are concerned,
have abolished</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>marriage</b>?&#8221;<a id="FNanchor188"></a><a href="#Footnote188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Blaschko adduces proofs that in all places in which free love is
not possible <b>prostitution takes its place</b>.</p>

<p>This fact affords a striking proof of the necessity of free love.
For there can be no doubt as to the correct answer to the question
which is better, prostitution or free love.</p>

<p>Max Marcus and other physicians have recently discussed the
question whether the medical man is justified in recommending
extra-conjugal sexual intercourse. I myself, as a physician,
and as an ardent supporter of the efforts for the suppression
of venereal diseases, in view of the enormous increase of
professional prostitution (both public and private), and in view
also of the extraordinarily wide diffusion of venereal diseases, feel
compelled to answer this question, generally speaking, <b>in the
negative</b>. Yet I look to the introduction of free love, and in
association with free love of a new sexual morality, in accordance
with which man and woman are regarded as two free personalities,
with equal rights and also equal responsibilities, as the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
possible rescue from the misery of prostitution and of venereal
disease.</p>

<p>Place the free woman beside the free man, inspire both with the
profound sense of <b>responsibility</b> which will result from the activity
of the love of two free personalities, and you will see that to them
and to their children such love will bring true happiness.</p>

<p>Before going further into this problem of free love, I will give a
brief account of the history of the question during the nineteenth
century. We shall see that quite a number of leading spirits,
morally lofty natures, were occupied with the question, because
they were deeply impressed with the intolerable character of
existing conditions in the sexual sphere, and were convinced that
help was only to be found in a relaxation of those conditions in
the sense of a <b>freer</b> conception of sexual relationships.</p>

<p>In addition to the romanticists (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page169">pp. 169</a> and <a href="#Page175">175</a>) in
the beginning of the nineteenth century in England, William
Godwin, the lover and husband of Mary Wollstonecraft (the
celebrated advocate of woman&#8217;s rights), in his &#8220;Political Justice,&#8221;
declared the conventional coercive marriage to be an obsolete
institution, by which the freedom of the individual was seriously
curtailed. Marriage is a question of property, and one person ought
not to become the property of another. Godwin maintained that
the abolition of marriage would have no evil consequences.
The free love and subsequent marriage of Godwin and Mary
Wollstonecraft deserves a short description. Godwin was of
opinion that the members of a family should not see too much of
one another. He also believed that they would interfere with one
another&#8217;s work if they lived in the same house. For this reason
he furnished some rooms for himself at a little distance from Mary
Wollstonecraft&#8217;s dwelling, and often first appeared at her house
at a late lunch; the intervening hours were spent by both in
literary work. They exchanged letters also during the
<span class="nowrap">day.<a id="FNanchor189"></a><a href="#Footnote189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless under the influence of the views of Godwin, Shelley,
in the notes to &#8220;Queen Mab,&#8221; writes a violent polemic against
coercive marriage. He says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Love withers under constraint; its very essence is liberty; it is
compatible neither with obedience, jealousy, nor fear; it is there
most pure, perfect, and unlimited, where its votaries live in confidence,
equality, and unreserve. How long, then, ought the sexual
connexion to last? What law ought to specify the extent of the
grievances which should limit its duration? A husband and wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
ought to continue so long united as they love each other; any law
which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the
decay of their affection would be a most intolerable
<span class="nowrap">tyranny.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>He then proceeds to attack the conventional morality so
intimately associated with coercive marriage, and concludes with
the words:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Chastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition, a greater foe
to natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality; it strikes
at the root of all domestic happiness, and consigns more than half
of the human race to misery, that some few may monopolize according
to law. A system could not well have been devised more studiously
hostile to human happiness than marriage. I conceive that from the
abolition of marriage, the fit and natural arrangement of sexual connexion
would result. <b>I by no means assert that the intercourse would
be promiscuous</b>; on the contrary, it appears, from the relation of
parent to child, that this union is generally of long duration, and
marked above all others with generosity and
<span class="nowrap">self-devotion.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor191"></a><a href="#Footnote191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Here, also, we find the expression of the firm conviction that
in the freedom of love is to be found an assured guarantee for its
durability!</p>

<p>Later, also, the English Pre-Raphaelites, especially John
Ruskin, advocated free love, and maintained that the sacredness
of these natural bonds lay in their very essence. It is love which
first makes marriage legal, not marriage which legalizes love
(<i>cf.</i> Charlotte Broicher, &#8220;John Ruskin and his Work,&#8221; vol. i.,
pp. 104-106; Leipzig, 1902).</p>

<p>In Germany, at the commencement of the nineteenth century,
a lively discussion of the problems of love and marriage ensued
upon the publication of Friedrich Schlegel&#8217;s &#8220;Lucinde&#8221; and
Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Wahlverwandtschaften&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Elective Affinities&#8221;
(1809).</p>

<p>Goethe, in his very rich amatory life, especially in his relationship
to Charlotte von Stein and to Christiane Vulpius, with the
latter of whom he lived for eighteen years in a free &#8220;marriage of
<span class="nowrap">conscience,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor192"></a><a href="#Footnote192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span>
and whose son, August, the offspring of this union,
he adopted long before the marriage was legitimized, realized the
ideal of free love more than once. Although in his book
&#8220;Wahlverwandtschaften&#8221; (&#8220;Elective Affinities&#8221;) he at length
gave the victory to the moral conception of monogamic marriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
and propounded it as an illuminating ideal for civilization (which
&#8220;ideal standpoint&#8221; we ourselves, as we have shown in the
previous chapters, fully share), yet in this novel he has represented
conjugal struggles, from which it appears how profoundly he was
impressed by the importance of a transformation of amatory life
in the direction of freedom. It is especially by the mouth of the
Count in this work that he gives utterance to such ideas. The
latter records the advice of one of his friends that every marriage
should be contracted for the term of five years only.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;This number,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a beautiful, sacred, odd number, and
such a period of time would be sufficient for the married pair to learn
to know one another, for them to bring a few children into the world,
to separate, and, what would be most beautiful of all, to come together
again.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Often he would exclaim:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;How happily would the first portion of the time pass! Two or
three years at least would pass very happily. Then very likely one
member of the pair would wish that the union should be prolonged;
and this desire would increase the more nearly the terminus of the
marriage approached. An indifferent, even an unsatisfied, member
of such a union would be pleased by such a demeanour on the part of
the other. One is apt to forget how in good society the passing of
time is unnoticed; one finds with agreeable surprise, when the allotted
time has passed away, <b>that it has been tacitly prolonged</b>. It is precisely
this voluntary, tacit prolongation of sexual relationship, freely
undertaken by both parties without any extraneous compulsion, to
which Goethe ascribes <b>a profound moral significance</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>I should like to draw the attention of students of Goethe to
the fact that this recommendation of a temporary marriage for
the term of five years, with tacit prolongation of the term, is a
very ancient Japanese custom, or, at any rate, was so thirty
years ago.</p>

<p>Wernich, who for several years was Professor of Medicine at
the Imperial University of Japan, remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Marriages were concluded for a term only: in the case of persons
of standing for <b>five</b> years; among the lower classes for a shorter
term. It was <b>very rare</b>, however, only in cases in which the marriage
was manifestly unhappy, for a separation to take place when the term
expired. If there were healthy living children such a separation
hardly ever occurred&mdash;most of these temporary marriages were, in
fact, extremely happy, and the same is true of Jewish marriages, in
which divorce is easily effected by a very simple ceremonial, closely
resembling that of the
<span class="nowrap">Japanese.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor193"></a><a href="#Footnote193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span></p>

<p>In view of the remarkable coincidence between the proposal in
Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Elective Affinities&#8221; and the Japanese custom, we are
probably justified in assuming that Goethe was acquainted with
the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucinde&#8221; gave expression to the feelings and moods of the
time in respect of love and marriage on behalf of a circle far
wider than that of the romanticists. At no time were the ideals
of free love so deeply felt, so enthusiastically presented, as then;
above all, by the beautiful Karoline, who, after long &#8220;marriage
wanderings,&#8221; especially with A. W. Schegel, finally found the
happiness of her life in a free marriage with Schelling, which
subsequently became a legally recognized union.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In her letters,&#8221; says Kuno Fischer, &#8220;she praises again and again
the man of her choice and of her heart, in whose love she had really
attained the goal which she had longed and sought in labyrinthine
wanderings.... And that Schelling was the man who was able completely
to master the heart of this woman and to make her his own,
gives to his features also an expression which beautifies
<span class="nowrap">them.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor194"></a><a href="#Footnote194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Rahel, Dorothea Schlegel, and Henriette Herz, extolled,
under the influence of &#8220;Lucinde,&#8221; the happiness of free love.
For this period of genius in Jena and Berlin, as Rudolph von
Gottschall calls it, the free-love relationship of Prince Louis
Ferdinand of Prussia and Frau Pauline Wiesel was typical.
This relationship is more intimately known to us from the letters
exchanged between the two, published by Alexander B&uuml;chner
in 1865. In these letters, to quote a saying of Ludmilla Assing,
we find &#8220;the most passionate expression of all that it is possible
to express in writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>In France the discussion of the question of free love was to an
important extent associated with the communistic-socialistic
ideas of Saint Simon, Enfantin, and Fourier. Before this, R&eacute;tif
de la Bretonne, in his &#8220;D&eacute;couverte Australe&#8221; (a work which
exercised a great influence upon Charles
<span class="nowrap">Fourier),<a id="FNanchor195"></a><a href="#Footnote195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span> demanded that
the duration of marriage should be in the first instance two years,
with which period the contract should spontaneously terminate.
Saint Simon and Barrault proclaimed the &#8220;free wife,&#8221; P&egrave;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
Enfantin proclaimed the &#8220;free union,&#8221; and Fourier proclaimed
&#8220;free love&#8221; in the phalanstery.</p>

<p>A reflection of this idea is to be found in the novels of George
Sand, especially &#8220;Lelia&#8221; and &#8220;Jacques,&#8221; these tragedies of
marriage; in &#8220;Jacques,&#8221; for example, we find the following
passage:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I continue to believe that marriage is one of the most hateful of
institutions. I have no doubt whatever that when the human race
has advanced further towards rationality and the love of justice,
marriage will be abolished. <b>A human and not less sacred union</b>
would then replace it, and the existence of the children would be not
less cared for and secured, without therefore binding in eternal fetters
the freedom of the parents.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>We must mention Hortense Allart de M&eacute;ritens (1801-1879) as
a contemporary of the much-loving George Sand, and, like her,
a theoretical and practical advocate of free love. She was
cousin to the well-known authoress Delphine Gay, and herself
wrote a <i>roman &agrave; clef</i>, published in 1872, &#8220;Les Enchantements de
Prudence,&#8221; in which she records the history of her own life,
devoted to free love. First the beloved of a nobleman, she ran
away when she discovered she was pregnant, and then lived
successively with the Italian statesman Gino Capponi (1826-1829);
with the celebrated French author Chateaubriand (1829-1831);
with the English novelist and poet Bulwer (1831-1836);
the Italian Mazzini (1837-1840); the critic Sainte-Beuve (1840-1841);
these being all free unions. From 1843 to 1846 she was the
perfectly legitimate and extremely unhappy wife of an architect
named Napol&eacute;on de M&eacute;ritens, whereas with her earlier lovers
she had lived most happily. L&eacute;on S&eacute;ch&eacute;, in the <i>Revue de Paris</i>
of July 1, 1907, has recently described the life of this notable
priestess of free love, to whose above-mentioned romance George
Sand wrote a preface (<i>cf.</i> <i>Literarisches Echo</i> of August 1, 1907,
pp. 1612, 1613).</p>

<p>In Sweden at about the same time the celebrated poet C. J. L.
Almquist was a powerful advocate for free love. In the numbers
for July and August, 1900, of the monthly review, <i>Die Insel</i>,
Ellen Key has published a thoughtful essay, containing an
analysis of Almquist&#8217;s views on this subject.</p>

<p>In the novel &#8220;Es Geht An&#8221; Almquist advocates the thesis
that true love needs no consecration by a marriage ceremony.
On the contrary, a ceremony of this kind belies the very nature
of marriage, for it forms and cements false unions; and any
relationship concluded on the lowest grounds, if it has only been<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
preceded by a marriage ceremony, is regarded as pure, whilst
a union based upon true love without marriage is regarded as
unchaste. In the sense of free love Lara Widbeck, in &#8220;Es Geht
An,&#8221; arranges her own life and that of her husband Albert.
Both are to be masters of their respective persons and of their
respective property; they are to live for themselves, the work
of each is to be pursued independently of the other, and in this
way it will be possible to preserve a lifelong love, instead of seeing
love transformed into lifelong indifference or hate.</p>

<p>Even at the present day in Sweden the idea of free love is
known, after this romance of Almquist&#8217;s, as the &#8220;Es-geht-an
idea&#8221; and also as &#8220;briar-rose morality.&#8221; It was, above all,
Ellen Key who revived Almquist&#8217;s idea, and enlarged it to the
extensive programme of marriage reform in the direction of free
love, which we shall consider more fully below.</p>

<p>In his last writings Schopenhauer occupied himself at considerable
length with the problems of love, but entirely from
the standpoint of misogyny and of duplex sexual morality.
Still, he recognized the great dangers and disasters which the
traditional coercive marriage entails upon society, and rightly
regarded this formal marriage as the principal source of sexual
corruption.</p>

<p>In his essay &#8220;Concerning Women&#8221; (&#8220;Parerga and Paralipomena,&#8221;
vol. xi., pp. 657-659), ed. Grisebach, he writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Whereas among the polygamist nations every woman is cared
for, among monogamic peoples the number of married women is
limited, and there remains an enormous number of unsupported superfluous
<span class="nowrap">women.<a id="FNanchor196"></a><a href="#Footnote196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
Among the upper classes these vegetate as useless
old maids; among the lower classes they are forced to earn their
living by immeasurably severe toil, or else they become prostitutes.
These latter lead a life equally devoid of pleasure and of honour;
but in the circumstances they are indispensable for the gratification
of the male sex, and hence they constitute a publicly recognized profession,
the especial purpose of which is to safeguard against seduction
those women more highly favoured by fortune, who have found husbands,
or may reasonably hope to do so. In London alone there are
80,000 such women. <b>What else are these women than human sacrifices
on the altar of monogamy</b>&mdash;<b>sacrifices rendered inevitable by the very
nature of the monogamic institution?</b> All the women to whom we
now allude&mdash;women in this miserable position&mdash;form the inevitable
counterpoise to the ladies of Europe, with their pretension and their
pride. For the female sex, regarded as a whole, polygamy is a real
benefit. On the other hand, from the rationalistic point of view, it is
impossible to see why a man whose wife is suffering from a chronic
disease, or remains unfruitful, or has gradually become too old for<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
him, should not take a second wife. That which produces so many
converts to Mormonism appears to be the rejection by the Mormons of
the unnatural institution of monogamy. In addition, moreover, the
allotment to the wife of unnatural rights has imposed upon her unnatural
duties, whose neglect, nevertheless, makes her unhappy. To
many a man considerations of position, of property, make marriage
inadvisable, unless the conditions are exceptionally favourable. He
would then wish to obtain a wife of his own choice, under conditions
which would leave him free from obligations to her and her children.
However economical, reasonable, and suitable these conditions may
be, if she agrees to them, and does not insist upon the immoderate
rights which marriage alone secures to her, she will, because marriage
is the basis of every society, find herself compelled to lead an unhappy
life, one which, to a certain degree, is dishonourable; because human
nature involves this, that we assign a quite immeasurable value to
the opinion of others. If, on the other hand, she does not comply,
she runs the danger either of being compelled to belong as a wife to a
man repulsive to her, or else of withering as an old maid, for the period
in which she can realize her value is very short. In relation to this
aspect of our monogamic arrangement, the profoundly learned treatise
of Thomasius, <i>De Concubinatu</i>, is of the greatest possible value, for we
learn from it <b>that among all cultured people, and in all times, until
the date of the Lutheran Reformation, concubinage was permitted,
and even to a certain extent legally recognized, and was an institution
not involving any dishonour</b>. From this position it was degraded
only by the Lutheran Reformation, for the degradation of concubinage
was regarded as a means by which the marriage of priests could be
justified; and, on the other hand, after the Lutheran denunciation of
concubinage, the semi-official recognition of that institution by the
Roman Catholic Church was no longer possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Regarding polygamy there need be <b>no dispute</b>, for it is a universally
existing fact, and the only question is regarding its <b>regulation</b>. Where
are the true monogamists? We all live <b>at least</b> for a time, but most
of us continually, in a state of polygamy. Since, consequently, every
man makes use of many wives, nothing could be more just than to
leave him free, and even to compel him, to provide for many wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as are these views of Schopenhauer&#8217;s regarding the necessity
of a freer conception and a freer configuration of sexual relations,
and regarding the shamefulness of exposing to infamy the
unmarried mother and the illegitimate child, so much the more
dangerous is his view of the part to be played by women in this
reform of marriage. Woman as an inferior being, without freedom,
is once more to lose all her rights, instead of standing beside man
as a free personality with equal rights and equal duties. The
result of a rearrangement of amatory life on this basis would
inevitably be a new and a worse sexual slavery.</p>

<p>As Julius Frauenst&auml;dt records, Schopenhauer, in a separate
manuscript found amongst his papers, has described the evil
conditions of monogamy, and has recommended, as a step to<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
reform, the practice of &#8220;tetragamy.&#8221; This peculiar and unquestionably
very interesting essay has not found its way into
the Royal Library of Berlin. With regard to the whereabouts
of the manuscript we are uncertain; perhaps Frauenst&auml;dt
destroyed it.</p>

<p>However, we find a brief, hitherto unpublished, extract from
this essay in Schopenhauer&#8217;s manuscript book, &#8220;Die Brieftasche,&#8221;
written in 1823, which is preserved in the Royal Library in
<span class="nowrap">Berlin.<a id="FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>I publish here, for the first time, the summary account of
tetragamy contained on pp. 70-77 of the aforesaid manuscript
book:</p>

<h4>SKETCH OF SCHOPENHAUER&#8217;S &#8220;TETRAGAMY&#8221;<br />
<span class="fsize90">(<span class="smcap">Hitherto Unpublished</span>).</span></h4>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Inasmuch as Nature makes the number of women nearly identical
with that of men, whilst women retain only about half as long as men
their capacity for procreation and their suitability for masculine
gratification, the human sexual relationship is disordered at the very
outset. By the equal numbers of the respective sexes, Nature appears
to point to monogamy; on the other hand, a man has <b>one</b> wife for the
satisfaction of his procreative capacity only for half the time for which
that capacity endures; he must, then, take a second wife when the
first begins to wither; but for each man only one woman is available.
The tendency exhibited by woman in respect of the duration of her
sexual capacity is compensated, on the other hand, by the quantity
of that capacity: she is capable of gratifying two or three vigorous
men simultaneously, without suffering in any way. In monogamy,
woman employs only half of her sexual capacity, and satisfies only
half of her desires.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, now, this relationship were arranged in accordance with purely
physical considerations (and we are concerned here with a physical,
extremely urgent need, the satisfaction of which is the aim of marriage,
alike among the Jews and among the Christians), if matters were to be
equalized as completely as possible, it would be necessary for two
men always to have one wife in common: let them take her when
they are both young. After she has become faded, let them take
another young woman, who will then suffice for their needs until both
the men are old. Both women are cared for, and each man is responsible
for the care of one only.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the monogamic state, the man has for a single occasion too
much, and for a permanency too little; with the woman it is the other
way about.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the proposed institution were adopted in youth, a man, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
time when his income is usually smallest, would have to provide only
for half a wife, and for few children, and those young. Later, when
he is richer, he would have to provide for one or two wives and for
numerous children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since this institution has not been adopted&mdash;for half their life men
are whoremongers, and for the other half cuckolds; and women must
be correspondingly classified as betrayed and betrayers&mdash;he who
marries young is tied later to an elderly wife; he who marries late in
youth acquires venereal disease, and in age has to wear the horns.
Woman must either sacrifice the bloom of her youth to a man already
withered; or else must discover that to a still vigorous man she is no
longer an object of desire. The institution we propose would cure
all these troubles; the human race would lead happier lives. The
objections are the following:</p>

<ul class="tetragamy">

<li>&#8220;1. That a man would not know his own children. Answer:
This could, as a rule, be determined by likeness and other
considerations; in existing conditions it is not always a
matter of certainty.</li>

<li>&#8220;2. Such a <i>menage &agrave; trois</i> would give rise to brawls and jealousy.
Answer: Such things are already universal; people must
learn to behave themselves.</li>

<li>&#8220;3. What is to be done as regards property? Answer: This
will have to be otherwise arranged; absolute <i>communio
bonorum</i> will not occur. As we have already said, Nature
has arranged the affair badly. It will, therefore, be impossible
to overcome all disadvantages.</li>

</ul>

<p>&#8220;As matters are at present, Duty and Nature are continually in
conflict. For the man it is impossible from the beginning to the end
of his career to satisfy his sexual impulse in a legal manner. Imagine
his condition if he is widowed quite young. For the woman, to be
limited to a <b>single</b> man during the short period of her full bloom and
sexual capacity, is an unnatural condition. She has to preserve for
the use of one individual what he is unable to utilize, and what many
others eagerly desire from her; and she herself, in thus refusing, must
curb her own desires. Just think of it!</p>

<p>&#8220;More especially we have to remember that always the number of
men competent for sexual intercourse is double the number of functionally
capable women, for which reason every woman must continually
repel advances; she prepares for defence immediately a man
comes near her.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>When we consider this suggestion of tetragamy of Schopenhauer&#8217;s
from our own standpoint, we find an accurate exposition
of the evils arising from monogamic coercive marriage, and a
clear-sighted presentation of the physiological disharmonies of
the sexual life arising from the difference between man and
woman, upon which recently Metchnikoff also has laid so much
stress. In other respects Schopenhauer&#8217;s views are for us
not open to discussion, for, as already pointed out, he regards
woman from the first simply as a chattel, and denies to her any<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
individuality or soul; and, secondly, because he rejects the
principle of the <b>only-love</b>&mdash;a principle so intimately associated
with the idea of woman as individual. For the watchword of
the future must be: Free love, based upon the only-love! and,
indeed, the only-love manifesting itself reciprocally in the full
struggle for existence.</p>

<p>For this reason, also, the characteristic free love of the
Bohemians of Paris during the second half of the nineteenth
century, and more especially during the period 1830 to 1860, can
only be regarded as a truly poetic love-idyll, when compared
with that grand and earnest love consecrated wholly to <b>work</b>,
and to the <b>inward spiritual development</b> which presents itself to
modern humanity as an ideal love, as the united conquest of
existence. Grisette love, which Sebastian Mercier described
with great force, and which found its classic representation in
Henry Murger&#8217;s &#8220;Vie de Boh&egrave;me,&#8221; was characterized by the
enduring life-in-common of the loving couples, who belonged
for the most part to the circle of artists and students. Thus it
stood high as heaven above our modern &#8220;intimacy,&#8221; which,
for the most part, has a quite transitory character; and yet the
Bohemian free love corresponded in no way to the conception
and ideal of free love as a community of spirit and of life.</p>

<p>The development of modern civilization, in association with
the awakening of individualism, and with the economic revolution
of our time, has created entirely new foundations for sexual
relationships, and has made continually more apparent the
injurious and destructive effects of our long outworn sexual
morality. These changes have taught us to understand that in
the so-called social question the sexual problem possesses as much
importance as the economic problem&mdash;perhaps more. They
have shown us the necessity for a new love of the future, for the
reason that to cling to the old, outlived forms would be equivalent
to a continuous increase in sexual corruption in the widest
sense of the word, combined with a general disease contamination
of civilized nations&mdash;as the threatening spread of prostitution,
and more especially of secret prostitution, and the increased
diffusion of venereal diseases, demonstrate before our eyes.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time, during recent years, among the
various civilized nations of Europe there have originated efforts
for a radical transformation of conventional sexual morality,
and for a reform, adapted to modern conditions, of marriage and
of the entire amatory life. In France, England, Sweden, and
Germany, writers have appeared, producing books, many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
which have been important, full of matter, and comprehensive,
entirely devoted to this object. Societies for marriage reform
and sexual reform have been founded in North America, France,
Austria, and Germany; parliamentary commissions for the
investigation of these questions have been established. Several
newspapers have been founded for the reform of sexual ethics.
In short, a general interest has been aroused in this central
question of life, and theoretical and practical activity have been
directed towards its solution.</p>

<p>All at once, as if by general agreement, civilized humanity
asked itself the earnest and solemn question, How was it possible
that to hundreds and thousands the simple right to love
was refused, so that they were condemned to a joyless existence,
in which all the beautiful blossoms of life withered away; that
hundreds of thousands of others were condemned to the hideous
misery of prostitution; that, finally, the <b>community at large</b>
was delivered up in ever-increasing degree to devastation by
venereal diseases and their consequences?</p>

<p>How is it possible, asks Karl Federn, in the preface to his
translation of Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;Wenn die Menschen reif zur Liebe
werden&#8221; (&#8220;Love&#8217;s Coming-of-Age&#8221;)&mdash;how is it possible that
we sing love-songs, and yet have an amatory life like that which
we lead to-day, and have a moral doctrine such as that which is
dominant to-day?</p>

<p>All honour to the men and women who have dared to give an
answer to these questions, who have opposed conventional lies
with the truth of love, and who point out the new way along
which mankind will go&mdash;will go, because it <b>must</b>.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to mention by name all the writings
dealing with the reform of sexual relationships which have
appeared within recent years. Their name is legion. We must
content ourselves with an allusion to those books which most of
all deserve the name of epoch-making, which have aroused the
interest of the community, and which may probably be said to
have first stimulated the discussion of the problem, and to have
been principally effective in starting the flowing current of
reform.</p>

<p>In France, Charles Albert has treated the problem of free love
from the communistic <span class="nowrap">standpoint.<a id="FNanchor198"></a><a href="#Footnote198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
In the first two chapters of
his book, he describes the development of the primitive sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
impulse, to become the most supreme individual love, and then
gives an interesting account of the struggle of middle-class society
against love, which to-day is endangered to an equal extent both
by the <b>state</b> and by <b>capital</b>.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Capitalistic society represents one fact, love another. It suffices
to place them one beside the other in order to notice how sharp a contrast
there is between them, an eternal state of war.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is only money that dominates the thought and feeling of
modern humanity; for love and its idealism there is no longer
any room; social economy recognizes only a sexual relationship,
but not the higher feeling of love. Capital subjects the whole
of the sexual life to its laws. In prostitution this great social
crime finds its conclusion. The majority of marriages are nothing
more than &#8220;sexual bargains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Free love is simply love liberated from the dominion of the
state and of capital. It can, therefore, be realized only by an
economic revolution, which will put an end to the economic
struggle for existence. Free love means the independence of the
sexual from the material life. <b>Economic reform</b> is the only way
to the higher love. This is the author&#8217;s conviction. But he is
not subject to any deceptive delusion that with this all will become
beautiful and good; with this all problems will be solved,
all incompleteness at an end.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We do not,&#8221; Albert continues, &#8220;regard the province of the sexual
life in the society of the future as an Eden, wherein those individuals
best suited one to the other will come together with mathematical
certainty, to lead a cloudless existence. Just as to-day, there will be
unrequited love, uncertain search and endeavour, errors and deceptions,
misunderstandings, satiety, aberrations, and sorrows. However great
the material prosperity may be which mankind in the future will
enjoy, the life of feeling will always remain the source of incalculable
disturbances, and love will not be the rarest cause of such disturbances;
but still a large proportion of the existing causes of pain can
and must disappear.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The indispensable preliminary to free love is the complete
equality of man and woman. This, however, can only be attained
by means of communism&mdash;that is to say, by that ordering of
society in which property and wages cease to exist, in which not
only the means of production, but also all the articles of consumption,
are appropriated to the common use, and woman will
no longer possess a commercial value, as she does at the present
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span></p>

<p>Like Albert, Ladislaus <span class="nowrap">Gumplowicz<a id="FNanchor199"></a><a href="#Footnote199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span>
also believes that free
love can only be realized in a collectivist community.</p>

<p>However important it is to draw attention to the economic
point of view, as was done before Albert and Gumplowicz by
Bebel, in his celebrated &#8220;Woman and Socialism&#8221; (thirty-fourth
edition, Stuttgart, 1903), still, it appears to me that the communistic
solution is not the only possible solution, and that free
love can very well be associated with the preservation of private
<span class="nowrap">property.<a id="FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>While the progressive changes in the economic structure of
society powerfully influence sexual relationships and lay down
the rules for their existing forms, still, physiological individual
factors play a great part also in the matter. The first to insist
on this fact were the Englishman Carpenter and the Swedish
writer Ellen <span class="nowrap">Key.<a id="FNanchor201"></a><a href="#Footnote201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward <span class="nowrap">Carpenter,<a id="FNanchor202"></a><a href="#Footnote202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
at one time a priest in the Anglican Church,
in his study of the question of free love, without ignoring the
economic factor, lays stress above all on the psychical factor, the
inward spiritual relationship between man and wife.</p>

<p>He writes (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 120):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is in the very nature of Love that as it realizes its own aim it
should rivet always more and more towards a durable and distinct
relationship, nor rest till the permanent mate and equal is found. As
human beings progress, their relations to each other must become
much <b>more</b> definite and distinct, instead of less so&mdash;and there is no
likelihood of society in its onward march lapsing backwards, so to
speak, to formlessness again.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Above all, Carpenter has introduced into the discussion of free
love an element which to me appears of great importance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
the medical standpoint: the question of relative asceticism, of
<b>self-control</b>. He rightly considers that the duty of the love of
the future does not subsist merely in the common physical union,
but also in <b>spiritual procreation</b>. From the intimate spiritual
contact between two differentiated personalities, the highest
spiritual values proceed. Only self-control leads us to this
highest love.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is a matter of common experience that the unrestrained outlet
of merely physical desire leaves the nature drained of its higher love-forces....
Any one who has once realized how glorious a thing Love
is in its essence, and how indestructible, will hardly need to call anything
that leads to it a sacrifice&#8221; (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 7, 8).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The indispensable prerequisites to the reform of love and
marriage are, according to Carpenter, the following (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 100):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>(1) The furtherance of the freedom and self-dependence of women.
(2) The provision of some rational teaching, of heart and of head, for
both sexes during the period of youth. (3) The recognition in marriage
itself of a freer, more companionable, and less pettily exclusive relationship.
(4) The abrogation or modification of the present odious
law which binds people together for <b>life</b>, without scruple, and in the
most artificial and ill-assorted unions.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Carpenter accepts Letourneau&#8217;s view, that, in a more or less
distant future, the institution of marriage will undergo transformation
into monogamic unions, freely entered on, and
when necessary freely dissolved, by simple mutual consent,
as is already done in several European countries&mdash;in Canton
Geneva, in Belgium, in Roumania, as regards divorce; and in
Italy as regards separation. State and society should take part
in the matter only so far as the safety of the children demands,
concerning whom <b>more extensive duties</b> should be expected from
the parents. Carpenter also points out, as was shown seventy
years ago by Gutzkow, that, as regards the development of the
children, it is better, in unhappy marriages, that their parents
should separate than that the children should grow up amid the
miseries of such marriages.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Love&#8221;&mdash;thus Carpenter concludes his dissertation on marriage
in the future&mdash;&#8220;is doubtless the last and most difficult lesson that
humanity has to learn; in a sense, it underlies all the others. Perhaps
the time has come for the modern nations when, ceasing to be children,
they may even try to learn it&#8221; (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 113).</p>

<p>A greater vogue even than Carpenter&#8217;s book had was obtained
by the essays of the Swedish writer Ellen Key, &#8220;Love and Marriage,&#8221;
which in 1894 appeared in a German
<span class="nowrap">translation,<a id="FNanchor203"></a><a href="#Footnote203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span> and had
an unusual success in the book-market. It is without exception
the most interesting and pregnant work on the sexual question
which has ever appeared. Written from the heart, and inspired
by the observations of a free and lofty spirit, it avoids none of
the numerous difficulties and by-paths in this department of
thought; and the reproach of libertinism which has been cast at
the author must be emphatically rejected. Ellen Key is the
most outspoken realist of all the writers on the subject of free
love. She takes her arguments from actual life; she associates
her ideas of reform always with the real; she writes as an earnest
evolutionist. Thus, in her book, her first aim is to establish
&#8220;the course of the evolution of sexual morality&#8221; and the &#8220;evolution
of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen Key starts from the fact that no one has ever offered any
proof that monogamy is that form of the sexual life which is
<b>indispensable</b> to the vital force and civilization of the nations.
Even among the Christian nations <b>it has never yet really existed</b>,
and its legalization as the only permissible form of sexual morality
has hitherto been rather harmful than helpful to general morality.</p>

<p>The writer then develops the idea, no less beautiful than true,
that the genuine character of love can be proved only by the
lovers actually living together for a considerable time; only
thus is it possible to demonstrate that it is moral for them to live
together, and that their union will have an elevating influence on
themselves and their generation. Consequently, of no conjugal
relationship can we <b>beforehand</b> affirm or deny its success. Every
new pair, whatever form they may have chosen for their common
life, <b>must first of all prove for themselves that they are morally
justified in living together</b>.</p>

<p>Ellen Key then proceeds to maintain a view, which I myself
also regard as an integral constituent of the programme of the
love of the future, and one which I have advanced in earlier
writings: that love is not merely, as Schopenhauer thought, an
affair of the <b>species</b>, but is, at least in equal degree, the concern
of the loving <b>individuals</b>. This is the result and the meaning of
civilization, which, as I have proved in earlier chapters, exhibits
a <b>progressive</b> individualization and an increasing spiritual enrichment
of love (the &#8220;spiritualized sensuality&#8221; of Ellen Key), and<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
thus gives to love a thoroughly independent importance for each
individual.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In view of the manner in which civilization has now developed
personal love, this latter has become so composite, so comprehensive
and far-reaching, that <b>not only in and by itself</b>&mdash;independently of the
species&mdash;<b>does it constitute a great life-value, but it also increases or
diminishes all other values</b>. In addition to its primitive importance,
it has gained a new significance: to carry the flame of life from sex to
sex. No one names that person immoral who, deceived in his love,
abstains in his married life from procreating the species; that husband
and wife also we shall not call immoral, who continue their married
life rendered happy by love, although their marriage has proved childless.
But in both cases <b>these human beings follow their subjective
feelings at the expense of the future generations, and treat their love
as an independent aim</b>. The right already recognized in these individual
cases, as belonging to the individual at the expense of the
species, will continue to undergo enlargement in proportion as the
importance of love continues to increase. On the other hand, the new
morality will demand from love an ever-increasing <b>voluntary limitation
of rights at those times when the growth of a new life renders it
necessary</b>. It will also demand a <b>voluntary or enforced renunciation
of the right to procreate new life under conditions which would make
this new life deficient in value</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Ellen Key terms this new, modern love &#8220;erotic monism,&#8221;
because it comprehends the <b>entire unitary personality</b>, including
the spiritual being, not merely the body. George Sand gave the
first definition of this love as being of such a kind that &#8220;neither
had the soul betrayed the senses, nor had the senses betrayed
the soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>This erotic monism proclaims as its indestructible foundation
the <b>unity of marriage and love</b>.</p>

<p>The idea of unity gives to the human being the right to arrange
his sexual life according to his personal wishes, subject to the
condition that he does not consciously injure the unity, and
therewith, mediately or immediately, the right, of possible
posterity.</p>

<p>Thus, according to Ellen Key, love &#8220;<b>will continually become
to a greater extent a private affair of human beings, whilst children,
on the contrary, will become more and more a vital problem of
society</b>.&#8221; From this it follows that the two &#8220;most debased and
socially sanctioned manifestations of sexual subdivision (of
dualism), <b>coercive marriage</b> and <b>prostitution</b>, will gradually
become <b>impossible</b>, because, after the victory of the idea of
unity, they will cease to correspond to human needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen Key rightly insists that among the young men of the
present day there is an increasing hostility to socially protected<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
immorality (both in the form of coercive marriage and in that of
prostitution); whilst they increasingly exhibit a monistic yearning
for love. The general diffusion, which we shall describe at
length in a special chapter, of ascetic moods and of misogyny
among men and of misandry among women, is partly connected
with the feeling that the present social forms of the sexual
relationship limit to an equal extent the worth and the freedom
of mankind.</p>

<p>To-day the &#8220;purity fanatics and the frantic sensualists&#8221; meet
in common mistrust of the developmental possibilities of love,
because they do not believe in the possible ennoblement of the
blind natural impulse. In contrast to these, Ellen Key reminds
us of the fact of the &#8220;mystical <b>yearning for perfection</b>, which in
the course of evolution has raised impulse to become passion,
and passion to become love, and which is now striving <b>to raise
love to an ever greater love</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must recognize love as <b>the spiritual force of life</b>. Love,
like the artist, like the man of science, has a right to the peculiar,
original activity of its own poietic force, to the production of new
spiritual values. The more perfect race that is to come must, in
the fullest meaning of the words, <b>be brought forth by love</b>.</p>

<p>For this, however, the indispensable preliminary is the inward
<b>freedom</b> of love; the free-love union is the watchword of the
future. Ellen Key also shows that among the lower classes free
love has long been customary, and that there the dangerous
utilization of prostitution is far more limited than among the
higher classes, with which view Blaschko&#8217;s statistical data regarding
the far greater diffusion of venereal diseases among the higher
classes of society are in substantial agreement.</p>

<p>No less indispensable to free love, however, is the full, mature
development of the loving individual. For this reason, Ellen
Key demands self-control and sexual continence at least until
the age of twenty years. She regards the indiscriminate sexual
intercourse which is to-day an established custom among all
young men as the murder of love. But too early marriages are
no less dangerous. She demands for the woman at least an age
of twenty; for the man, an age of twenty-five years; and <b>until
these respective ages are attained, sexual continence should be
observed as fully as possible by both sexes</b>.</p>

<p>This self-command is good for the physical development,
&#8220;steels the will, gives the joy of power to the personality; and
these qualities are later of importance in all other spheres of
activity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>With wonderful beauty, Ellen Key describes the happiness of
the <b>power of waiting</b> in love, and quotes in this connexion the
lovely phrases of the Swedish poet Karlfeldt:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;There is nothing on earth like the times of waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The days of springtime, the days of blossoming;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not even May can diffuse a light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the clear light of April.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, it is a demand of true morality that healthy
men and women between the ages of twenty and thirty years
should enjoy the possibility of marriage&mdash;of free marriage. This
possibility can, however, be secured only by economic reforms.</p>

<p>The author then considers the very important point of love&#8217;s
choice, and demands above all the compulsory provision of a
<b>medical certificate of health</b> before entering on marriage.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is absolutely beyond question that the healthy self-seeking
which wishes to safeguard the personal ego, in conjunction with the
increasing valuation of a healthy posterity, will hinder the contraction
of many unsuitable marriages. In other cases, love might overcome
these considerations, as far as husband and wife are themselves concerned;
but they must then renounce parentage. In those cases, on
the contrary, in which the law would distinctly forbid marriage, one
could naturally not prevent the sick persons from procreating independently
of marriage; but the same is true of all laws: the best
do not need them, the worst do not obey them, but the majority are
guided by them in the formation and development of their ideas of
what is right.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>As <b>immoral</b>, Ellen Key indicates:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Parentage without love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Irresponsible parentage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parentage on the part of immature or degenerate human beings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voluntary unfertility on the part of a married pair who are competent
to reproduce their kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;All manifestations of the sexual life resulting from force or
seduction, or from the disinclination or the incapacity for the proper
fulfilment of sexual intercourse.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is interesting to note that Ellen Key prophesies as the result
of the progressive improvement of the species by love&#8217;s selection,
the attainment of a state wherein <b>every</b> man and <b>every</b> woman
will be suited for the reproduction of the species. Then would
the ideal of monogamy, one husband for one wife, one wife for
one husband, be for the first time realized.</p>

<p>Very beautifully, and with a prudent insight into the actual
relationships, Ellen Key discusses the question of the &#8220;right to
motherhood,&#8221; where she finds occasion to describe the new and<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
very various types of women which the evolution of modern life
has brought into being. She recognizes only with reservation
the general right to motherhood, but she does not regard it as a
desirable example to follow when a woman becomes a mother
without love, either in marriage or out of it. It is not right to
do what is generally done to-day by the man-haters&mdash;namely, to
demand from the majority of unmarried women that they should
produce a child without love. This should not even happen when
love exists, but a permanent life-in-common with the father of
the child is impossible. An unmarried woman who determines
on motherhood should be fully <b>mature</b>, and already have behind
her &#8220;the second springtime&#8221; of her life; she must &#8220;not only be
pure as snow, pure as fire, but also must be possessed of the full
conviction that with the child of her love she will produce a
radiance in her own life and will endow humanity with new
wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Such</b> an unmarried woman really <b>makes a present</b> of her child
to humanity, and is quite different from the unmarried woman
who &#8220;has a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, for the <b>majority</b>, the ideal always remains that of the
ancient proverb, that man is only half a human being, woman
only half; and only the father and the mother with their child
become a whole one!</p>

<p>With regard to divorce, Ellen Key demands that it should be
perfectly free, and should depend only upon the definite desire,
held for a certain lapse of time, of either or both parties. The
dissolution of marriage must be no less easy than the breaking off
of an engagement.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Whatever drawbacks,&#8221; she says, &#8220;free divorce may involve,
they can hardly be worse than those which marriage has entailed,
and still continues to entail. Marriage has been degraded to the
coarsest sexual customs, the most shameless practices, the most
distressing spiritual murders, the most cruel ill-treatment, and the
grossest impairment of personal freedom, that any province of modern
life has exhibited! One need not go back to the history of civilization;
one need simply turn to the physician and magistrate, in order
to learn for what purpose the &#8216;sacrament of marriage&#8217; is employed,
and frequently employed by the very same men and women who are
professed enthusiasts as to its moral value!&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Just as little as the relations between friends, between parents
and children, or between brothers and sisters, necessarily give
rise to lasting sentiments of affection, is it possible to expect this
of two lovers. The &#8220;marriage fetters,&#8221; described with such
horrible truth by John Stuart Mill and Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnsen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
are to-day felt to be intolerable. The love of the modern man
flourishes only in freedom.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The delicate erotic sentiment of the present day shrinks from
becoming a fetter; it shuns the possibility of becoming a hindrance.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Free divorce, in a case of unhappy marriage, is no less necessary
when there are children to the marriage. The <b>duties</b> of the
parents to the children remain in such cases unaltered, without,
however, thus rendering it necessary that the parents should
continue to live together. For the sorrows of such a union, and
the harm done thereby to the children, are greater than those
that would result from divorce.</p>

<p>Human love has its phases of development. It does not remain
for ever the same, but it alters <i>pari passu</i> with the evolution of
the individual. Lifelong love is an ideal, but it is not a duty.
Such a demand would as inevitably destroy personality as would
the demand for the unconditional belief in a doctrine, or for the
unconditional pursuit of a profession.</p>

<p>Very interesting is Ellen Key&#8217;s description of the numerous
disillusions of love, which become still more perceptible in a coercive
marriage. There is a whole series of &#8220;typical unhappy
fates&#8221; in marriage, often with no blame properly attaching to
either party, dependent merely upon incompatibility of temperament,
but also upon faults of one or both parties to the marriage.</p>

<p>Frequently a man or a woman of a thoroughly sympathetic
temperament lives with a woman or a man of such faultless
excellence that the home seems filled with icicles. One day the
husband or the wife runs away because the air has become so
thin as to be irrespirable. The general sentiment is one of commiseration
for the&mdash;superlatively excellent man or woman!</p>

<p>In the case of earnest, mature human beings, free divorce will
not increase the number of dissolutions of marriage. On the
contrary, the obligations imposed by a free relationship are
greater than those of legal coercive marriage. The fear also that
with the granting of free divorce every one will enter upon
numerous free marriages one after another is groundless. It is
precisely those who are united in free love to whom such a separation,
when it does become necessary, is so profoundly painful,
that life itself forbids the frequent repetition of such unhappiness.</p>

<p>Very beautiful, and based upon lofty ethical conceptions, are
the writer&#8217;s views regarding the necessity for divorce precisely
in view of the existence of children. She says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Men and women of earlier times went on patching up for ever and
ever. The psychologically developed generation of to-day is more
inclined to let the broken remain broken. For, except in those
cases in which objective misfortunes, or a retarded evolution, gave
rise to a rupture, patched-up marriage, like patched-up engagements,
seldom prove durable. Often it was owing to profound instincts
that the rupture became inevitable; reconciliations fortify
these instincts, and sooner or later they once more find free vent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus it happens that even an exceptional nature is strained by
the burden it has to bear, and the children are not then witnesses of
their parents living together, but of their dying together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither religion nor law, neither society nor a family, can determine
what it is that marriage is killing in a man, or what he finds it
possible to rescue in that state&mdash;<b>he himself alone</b> knows the one
and suspects the other. He alone can delineate the boundaries, can
decide whether he is satisfied to regard his own existence as closed,
and to remain contented in the life of his children; whether he is able
so to endure the sorrows of a continued married life with such fortitude
as to make it increase his own powers and those of his children.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The conviction of the rights of love, and the consciousness of
the rights of the children, are to-day unmistakably on the increase.
There is no danger that the latter right, the right of the
children, will suffer in comparison with the rights of love. It is,
on the contrary, characteristic, that out of the very same feeling
by which the freer configuration of the amatory life is demanded,
there has also arisen a <b>new programme of the rights of children</b>.
This same Ellen Key who proclaims the inalienable rights of free
love, speaks also of the &#8220;<b>century of the child</b>,&#8221; and devotes to
this subject an admirable book.</p>

<p>The most important point with regard to free divorce, in respect
to the children, is that the father and the mother must not
separate from one another in hatred, but in friendship, and that,
in the interest of the children, they should continue to meet one
another from time to time. Ellen Key here rightly condemns
the conduct of the good friends and relatives who simply lay
down the law that the separated pair must hate one another,
and must in every relationship torment and cheat one another.
It is precisely such &#8220;enmity&#8221; of the parents after divorce that
is so full of bad consequences in respect of the children.</p>

<p>We also have to consider this point of view, that sometimes the
new husband or the new wife has a better influence over the
children than their own parents, and that in this way divorce
may have brought the children greater happiness, may have
been for them a true blessing.</p>

<p>The closing chapter of her work is devoted by Ellen Key to
the formulation of practical recommendations regarding the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
marriage laws. She indicates as a starting-point of her dissertation
that the ideal form of marriage is the perfectly free union
between a man and a woman. But this ideal can in the meanwhile
only be attained through <b>transitional forms</b>. In this the
opinion of society regarding the morality of the sexual relationship
must find expression, and thus remain as the support for
undeveloped personalities; but at the same time, these transitional
forms must be sufficiently free to favour a progressive
development of the higher erotic consciousness of the present day.</p>

<p>There always remains, therefore, the necessity for laws, to some
extent limiting individual freedom; but these laws must admit
of an advance towards perfection in respect of the freer gratification
of individual needs. <b>The sense of solidarity demands a new
marriage law adapted to new modern erotic needs, since the
majority are not yet prepared for complete freedom.</b> But it is
only the needs of modern civilized human beings, and not abstract
theories concerning the idea of the family or the &#8220;historic origin&#8221;
of marriage, that should be determinative in this matter.</p>

<p>In the marriage of the future, above all, the economic and legal
subordination of woman must be abolished. Woman must supervise
her own property and arrange her own work, and she must
in the main care for herself in so far as this is compatible with
her maternal duties. She must, however, have this assurance&mdash;that
<b>during the first years of the life of every child she shall be
cared for by society</b>, and this under the following conditions:</p>

<p>She must be of full age.</p>

<p>She must have performed her feminine &#8220;military service&#8221; by
a one year&#8217;s course of instruction in the care of children, in the
general care of health, and, whenever possible, in sick-nursing.</p>

<p>She must either care for her child herself or provide another
thoroughly competent nurse.</p>

<p>She must bring proof that she does not possess sufficient personal
property, or sufficient income from her work, in order to
provide for her own support and half of her child&#8217;s support, or
else that the care for her children compels her to discontinue her
professional occupation.</p>

<p>Only in exceptional cases should this support of motherhood
be provided for a longer time than <b>during the three first and most
important years of the life of the child</b>.</p>

<p>The funds for this most necessary of all kinds of insurance
must be provided in the form of a graduated income tax, graduated
so as to make the wealthier classes pay the most, and the <b>unmarried</b>
should pay just as much as the married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span></p>

<p>In every community the central authorities of this insurance
should consist of &#8220;<b>boards for the care of children</b>.&#8221; The members
of these boards should be two-thirds women and one-third men;
they should distribute the funds and supervise the care of the
infants and older children; in cases in which the mother was not
properly fulfilling her duties to the child, they could cut off
supplies, or remove the child from the mother&#8217;s care.</p>

<p>The mother should receive yearly the same sum, but, in addition,
she should receive for each child <b>half of the cost of its support</b>,
as long as the number of children is not exceeded which the
society has laid down as desirable. Children born in excess of
this number would be a private concern of the parents. Every
father must, from the time of birth until the child attains the
age of <b>eighteen years</b>, provide one-half of the money needed for
its support.</p>

<p>The existing immoral distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
children is practically equivalent to freeing unmarried
fathers from their natural responsibility, and drives unmarried
mothers to death, prostitution, or infanticide.</p>

<p>All this would be done away with by a law ensuring from the
State support for the mother during the first, most difficult years,
and ensuring the child a right to support from <b>both</b> parents, a
right also to the name of both, and to inheritance from both.</p>

<p>Legal expression is also demanded for the right of each member
of a married couple to possess his or her property; those who
wish to make any other arrangement can do so by special contract
after a definite valuation of their property. And in respect
of the right of inheritance, the <b>domestic work</b> of the wife (housekeeping
and the care of the children) must receive due economic
consideration&mdash;a matter hitherto ignored. Not only in respect
of her property, but also in respect of all civil rights, and of the
right of control over her own person, the married woman must
be placed in the same position as the unmarried.</p>

<p>Ellen Key&#8217;s remarks on the removal of the <b>coercion</b> exercised
at present on husband and wife <b>in respect of living together</b> are
very interesting. She writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;There are persons who would have continued to love one another
throughout the whole of their life had they not been compelled&mdash;day
after day, year after year&mdash;to adapt their customs, their volitions, and
their inclinations entirely according to one another&#8217;s tastes. So
much unhappiness depends, indeed, upon matters of almost no importance,
difficulties which two human beings endowed with moral
courage and insight would easily have overcome, had it not been that
the instinct towards happiness was overpowered by regard for ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
opinion. The more personal freedom a woman (or man) has had
before marriage, the more does she (or he) suffer in a home in which
she does not possess an hour or a corner for her own undisturbed use.
And the more the modern human being gains an increase in his individual
freedom of movement, the more he feels the need for privacy
in other relations, the more also will man and wife need these things
in the married state....</p>

<p>&#8220;But at present custom (and law) demand from the married pair
that they should lead a life in common, which often ends in a permanent
separation, merely because conventional considerations prevented
them from living apart!</p>

<p>&#8220;Also for those otherwise constituted, the narrow dependence,
the compulsory belonging each to the other, the daily adaptation, the
unceasing mutual consideration, may become oppressive. In continually
increasing numbers people are beginning quietly to transform
conjugal customs, so that they may correspond to the new needs. For
instance, each goes for a journey by himself, when he feels the need
for privacy; one of the pair seeks alone pleasures which the other
does not value; in former times both would have &#8216;enjoyed&#8217; them
together, against the will of one, or both would have renounced what
one could have genuinely enjoyed. More and more married people
have separate bedrooms, and after a generation, it is probable that
<b>separate dwelling-houses</b> for husband and wife will be sufficiently
common to arouse no particular attention.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>With regard to the question of personal freedom in marriage,
Ellen Key takes into account the possibility of marriage being
<b>kept secret</b> on urgent grounds; also the introduction of new
forms of divorce, the present procedure giving rise to such detestable
practices in the law-courts&mdash;for example, the detailed statement
of the grounds for divorce, or an account of the refusal or
the misuse of &#8220;conjugal rights,&#8221; or an account of the malicious
desertion of one party by the other.</p>

<p>The author, therefore, makes proposals for a new marriage law
and a new divorce law.</p>

<p>As conditions preliminary to marriage, the new law should
insist&mdash;</p>

<p>That man and wife should be of full age;</p>

<p>That neither should be more than twenty-five years older than
the other;</p>

<p>That neither should be closely related or connected with the
other, as the present law already forbids. The new law must in
this respect be modified in the sense either of greater severity or
of relaxation, according as the scientific knowledge of the future
may direct.</p>

<p>Finally, neither party should simultaneously enter upon
another marriage. On both parties will be imposed the duty
of providing a medical certificate regarding the state of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
health; a proposed marriage must be forbidden when either
party is suffering from a disease transmissible to the children
(also when suffering from a disease which would infect the other
party?). With regard to other illnesses, the matter may be left
to the free judgment of those wishing to be married.</p>

<p>Marriage will take place before the marriage assessor of the
commune, and before four other witnesses, without any special
ceremony; the contracting parties will enter their names in the
register, and their signatures will be witnessed by those present.
When for any reason the marriage is to be kept secret, the witnesses
will, of course, be bound to secrecy.</p>

<p>This civil marriage is all that the law will direct; the religious
ceremony will be a voluntary affair, and will have no legal force.</p>

<p>In marriage, husband and wife will retain all the <b>personal</b> rights
which they had before marriage, over their bodies, their names,
their property, their work, their wages, also the right to choose
their own place of residence, and all other civil rights. For
<b>common</b> expenses and debts they will have a common responsibility;
whilst each will be personally responsible for personal
expenditure and debts. In case of divorce, each will retain his
or her property. In the event of death, the widower or widow
will inherit half the property, the remainder going to the children.</p>

<p>For divorce, Ellen Key suggests there should be a &#8220;<b>council of
divorce</b>,&#8221; consisting of four persons, men or women. The first
aim of this council will be, somewhat like that of a court of
honour before a duel, to attempt to reconcile the parties, to adjust
any cause of quarrel. If this attempt fails, the matter must go
before the marriage assessor of the commune; but this cannot
take place until the expiration of <b>six months</b> from the time when
it was brought before the council of divorce. The council of
divorce must testify before the assessor that six months before
<b>each party was fully informed regarding the wish of the other
that the marriage should be dissolved, and regarding the reasons
for that wish</b>. If there are no children, if a division of the
property has been arranged, and if husband and wife have lived
<b>completely apart</b> for one year, the divorce will be effected one
year after the commencement of proceedings. When there are
children to the marriage, there will be needed a special &#8220;<b>jury
for the care of children</b>&#8221; to deal with the custody of the children.
If either party is found by the jury and the judge to be <b>unworthy</b>
for or <b>incapable</b> of the custody of the children, on the ground of
his (or her) <b>morals</b> or <b>character</b>, he (or she) loses his (or her)
rights. If either father or mother is deprived of the custody of<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
the children, a guardian must be appointed&mdash;a man to represent
the father, a woman to represent the mother&mdash;and this guardian
will supervise the education of the children in association with
the remaining parent. If both parents are found to be unfitted
for the custody of the children, the education of the latter must
be supervised by a guardian only. If both parents are <b>equally</b>
fitted and worthy for the custody of the children, the latter should
remain with the mother until the age of fifteen, and would then
have the right to choose between their parents.</p>

<p>Ellen Key demands severe laws against the seduction and
abandonment of girls <b>under age</b>, on the part of unconscientious
men; and she considers that the witting transmission of any
infective disorder by means of sexual intercourse should be
punished by imprisonment for a minimum term of six months.
Speaking generally, the law should always come to the assistance
of the weaker party, above all, to the assistance of the children,
and in most cases to the assistance of the mother.</p>

<p>Although the new marriage law is to give to <b>adult</b> citizens
complete freedom to arrange their erotic relationships at their
own <b>responsibility</b> and risk, <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> marriage, it remains
necessary that double marriages (bigamy), sexual relationships
within forbidden degrees, or on the part of persons suffering from
transmissible disease, which the law has declared to be a hindrance
to marriage, and also intercourse with persons under eighteen
years of age, should be regarded as punishable offences. The
same is true of homosexual and other perverse manifestations.
The <b>trial</b> in such cases will be conducted by a judge, with the
assistance of a jury of <b>physicians</b> and <b>crimino-psychologists</b>.</p>

<p>The writer does not believe that marriage will be transformed
by legal changes in the way outlined above, but she is of opinion
that what will happen is that &#8220;men and women will refuse to
submit themselves to the unworthy forms of marriage, which
will remain established by law, and will form free unions, the
so-called &#8216;<b>marriage of conscience</b>,&#8217;&#8221; such as those which the
Belgian sociologist Mesnil has recommended in his work, &#8220;Le
Libre Mariage.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is, in fact, in Sweden, Ellen Key&#8217;s fatherland, in which these
free marriages of conscience appear to have first obtained adherents.
She records the free union of the professor of national
economics at Lund, Knut Wicksell. Additional reports of free
marriages in Sweden are given by the Swedish physician Anton
<span class="nowrap">Nystr&ouml;m.<a id="FNanchor204"></a><a href="#Footnote204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span>
He mentions among those who have formed free<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
unions, without legal or ecclesiastical ceremony, but simply by
public notification, in addition to the already mentioned university
professor, also the editor of a leading newspaper, a physician
and doctor of philosophy, and a candidate of philosophy. The
latter is engaged in study with his wife at the high school at
G&ouml;teborg. In February, 1904, they made a public announcement
in the newspaper that they were entering on a &#8220;marriage
of conscience,&#8221; since they had a conscientious objection to the
ecclesiastical form of marriage. The principal of the college wrote
an address to the young couple, stating that, although this union
was not entered upon on immoral grounds, and therefore could
not be regarded as a punishable offence, still, such a free union,
unrecognized by the State, between man and woman, was not
compatible with the good order of society, that it was injurious
to the general ethical conception of the sacramental character of
marriage, and also constituted a dangerous example, which others
might be led to imitate. The principal therefore urged the young
people most earnestly &#8220;to place their union as soon as possible
on a legitimate footing.&#8221; This exhortation, however, led to no
result.</p>

<p>Moreover, the University of Upsala was more free-thinking
than that of G&ouml;teborg, for the above-mentioned professor and
his wife were, for a long time <b>after</b> they had become united in
free love, matriculated students at the University of Upsala, and
the university authorities favoured them with no attention with
regard to this matter.</p>

<p>In recent years, the public declaration of &#8220;free marriages&#8221;
has also found observance in other European countries. Thus,
not long ago the author who writes under the pseudonym of
&#8220;Roda-Roda&#8221; announced in the newspapers his free union with
the Baroness von Zeppelin; and in the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>, No. 410,
September 2, 1906, we find the following announcement:</p>

<p class="announcement">&#8220;Dr. Alfred Rahmer<br />
Wilhelmine Ruth Rahmer<br />
geb. Prinz-Flohr<br />
Frei-Verm&auml;hlte&#8221;<br />
(Free-Wedlock).</p>

<p class="noindent">Similar public announcements are reported from Holland. Moreover,
according to Nystr&ouml;m, it has since 1734 been legally established
in Sweden, that in certain cases engagement is <b>equivalent
to marriage</b>&mdash;namely, when the engaged woman becomes pregnant.
&#8220;When a man impregnates his fianc&eacute;e, <b>the engagement
becomes a marriage.... If the man refuse to go through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
ceremony of marriage</b>, and wishes to break off the engagement,
the woman is legally declared to be his wife, and enjoys full conjugal
rights in his house.&#8221; So runs this law.</p>

<p>We can predict with certainty that the adherents of free
marriage, the number of &#8220;marriage protestants,&#8221; as Ellen Key
happily calls them, will continue to increase. To such will belong
all those who have an equal antipathy to coercive marriage, to
the debasing intercourse with prostitutes, and to the transient
casual love, such as is experienced in ordinary extra-conjugal
sexual intercourse, the true &#8220;wild&#8221; love.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is only a question of time&#8221;&mdash;thus Ellen Key concludes her
remarks on marriage reform&mdash;&#8220;when the respect felt by society for
the sexual union will not depend upon the form of the life in common,
by which two human beings become parents, but only on the worth
of the children which these two are producing as new links in the
chain of the generations. Men and women will then devote to their
spiritual and physical preparation for sexual intercourse the same
religious earnestness that the Christians devote to the welfare of their
souls. No longer will divine laws regarding the morality of sexual
relationships be considered the mainstay of morality; in place of
these the desire to elevate the human race and a sense of personal
responsibility will be the safeguards of conduct. But the conviction
on the part of the parents <b>that the purpose of life is also their own
proper life&mdash;that is, that they do not exist only for the sake of children</b>&mdash;should
free them from certain other duties of conscience which at
present bind them in respect of children&mdash;above all, from the duty of
maintaining a union in which they themselves are perishing. The
home will perhaps become more than it is at present; something at
unity with the mother, something which&mdash;far from excluding the
father&mdash;carries within itself the germ of a new and higher &#8216;family
right.&#8217;...</p>

<p>&#8220;A greater and healthier will-to-live in respect of erotic feelings
and demands&mdash;this it is that our time needs! Here from the feminine
side real dangers threaten; and one of several ways in which these
dangers must be averted is by the construction of new forms of
marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Human material of ever higher worth and capable of higher evolution&mdash;it
is this which in the first place we have to create. If we preserve
coercive forms of the sexual life, the possibility of doing this is
a diminishing one; if we adopt free forms of the sexual life, the possibility
of doing it will increase. Not only because the present time
asks for more freedom are its demands full of promise, but because
those demands approximate ever more closely to the central point of
the problem&mdash;to the conviction that love is the principal condition
upon which depends the vital advance of the individual and of
humanity at large.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>I have given such a lengthy analysis of Ellen Key&#8217;s book
because, in the first place, in no other work do we find so lucid<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
an exposition of all the points needed for the consideration of the
question of free love&mdash;an exposition based upon the richest
experience of life and a really astonishing psychical knowledge
of mankind, combined with the finest understanding of the
subtle activities and sentiments of the loving soul; and, in the
second place, because as an actual fact&mdash;at any rate, in Germany&mdash;this
book has formed the true starting-point of all endeavours
towards the reform of sexual morality. Ellen Key&#8217;s &#8220;Ueber
Liebe und Ehe&#8221; (&#8220;Love and Marriage&#8221;) is a demonstration of
human rights in the matter of love; it is the evangel for those
who have determined to harmonize love with all the changes and
advances attendant on the evolution of civilization, and have resolved
not to allow the forcible retardation of progress by conditions
which were perhaps still tolerable one hundred or two
hundred years ago, but to-day are unconditionally <b>hostile to
civilization</b>.</p>

<p>In Germany these endeavours have been centralized in the
Bund f&uuml;r Mutterschutz (the Association for the Protection
of Mothers), founded in the beginning of 1906, whose purpose
it is to protect unmarried mothers and their children from
economic and moral dangers, to counteract the dominant condemnation
of such mothers, and thereby also indirectly to bring
about the reform of the existing views on sexual morality.
Those who initiated this most important movement were indeed
high-minded women. I mention, among many, only the names
of Ruth Br&eacute;, Helene St&ouml;cker, Maria Lischnewska, Adele Schreiber,
Gabriele Reuter, and Henriette F&uuml;rth.</p>

<p>By the preparatory committee to which Maria Lischnewska,
Dr. Borgius, Dr. Max Marcuse, Ruth Br&eacute;, and Dr. Helene St&ouml;cker
belonged, a committee meeting was called on January 5, 1905,
and the Association for the Protection of Mothers was founded,
its programme having already received the support of a
number of leading personalities from all parts of the German
Empire.</p>

<p>In addition to this committee, to which, besides the above-named
members of the preparatory committee, there belonged
Lily Braun, Georg Hirth, and Werner Sombart, a further committee
was formed, the members of which were: Alfred Blaschko,
Iwan Bloch, Hugo B&ouml;ttger, Lily Braun, Gr&auml;fin Gertrud B&uuml;low
von Dennewitz, M. G. Conrad, A. Damaschke, Hedwig Dohm,
Frieda Duensing, Chr. v. Ehrenfels, A. Erkelenz, W. Erb, A.

<p>In the programme which the newly founded Association
for the Protection of Mothers speedily published, we are
told:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>One hundred and eighty thousand illegitimate children are born in
Germany every year, approximately one-tenth of all births. This
important source of our strength as a people, children who at the time
of birth are usually endowed with powerful vitality (for their parents
are commonly in the bloom of youth and health), we allow to go
to ruin because a rigorous moral view bans unmarried mothers,
undermines their economic existence, and compels them to entrust
their children for payment to strange hands.</p>

<p>The momentous consequences of this state of affairs are shown by
the fact that the average number of still-births, in the case of illegitimate
children, amounts to 5 per cent., as compared with 3 per cent.
of still-births among the total number of births; the mortality of
illegitimate children during the first year of life is 28&middot;5 per cent., as
compared with 16&middot;7 per cent. for the mortality of all children born.
And whilst only a diminishing percentage of illegitimate children ever
become fitted for military service, the world of criminals, prostitutes,
and vagabonds, is recruited to an alarming extent from their ranks.
Thus, by unfounded moral prejudices, we produce artificially an army
of enemies to society. At the same time the birth-rate of Germany
is relatively declining. In the year 1876 the number of births per
1,000 living was 41; in the year 1900 it was only 35<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>!</p>

<p>To put an end to this robbery of the strength of our people is the
aim of the</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">Association for the Protection of Mothers</span>.</p>

<p>The attempt has already been made by means of cr&egrave;ches, foundling
institutions, and the like, to deal with this matter. <b>But the protection
of children without the protection of mothers is, and must remain,
no more than patchwork</b>; for the mother is the principal source of
life for the child, and is indispensable to the child&#8217;s prosperity. Whatever
ensures rest and care to the mother in her most difficult hours,
whatever secures her economic existence for the future, and protects
her from the contempt of her fellow-beings, by which her health is
endangered and her life embittered, will serve to provide a secure
foundation for the bodily and mental prosperity of the child, and
will simultaneously give the mother herself a stronger moral hold.
Therefore the Association for the Protection of Mothers will, above<span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span>
all, make the mothers&#8217; position safe, by assisting them to the attainment
of</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">Economic Independence</span></p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;especially such as are prepared to bring up their own children&mdash;by
the formation in country and in town of</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">Homes for Mothers</span>,</p>

<p class="noindent">in which, in addition, arrangements will be made for the necessary
care and upbringing of the children, the granting of legal protection,
and the provision of medical aid. Experience has shown that such
provision also corresponds to the wish of many of the fathers, and
assists in retaining their help and interest for mother and child.</p>

<p>The Association will, however, above all, close the sources from
which the present poverty of unmarried mothers arises, and these are
more especially the moral prejudices which at the present day defame
them socially, and the legal regulations which burden them almost
exclusively with the economic care and responsibility for the child,
and which entail on the father not at all, or in a quite insufficient
degree, his contribution to the burden.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">The Moral Defamation</span></p>

<p class="noindent">of unmarried mothers would, perhaps, be comprehensible if we lived
in economic and social conditions rendering it possible for every
one to marry soon after attaining sexual maturity, so that the involuntary
celibacy of adult persons was an abnormal state. In
such a time as ours, however, in which no less than 45 per cent. of all
women competent to bear children are unmarried, and those who
actually marry do so for the most part at a comparatively late age,
we must regard as untenable the view which considers the unmarried
woman giving birth to a child to be an outcast, thrusts her out of
society like the basest criminal, and gives her up to despair. Equally
untenable appears</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">The Present-Day Legal View</span>,</p>

<p class="noindent">which, when the actual father has not gone through the forms prescribed
by the State for a marriage, does not regard him as father in
the legal sense, ascribes to him no relationship with the child procreated
by him, and imposes on him no responsibility for the child or
its mother, although in the majority of cases the mother is economically
the weaker, and he himself economically the stronger party. There
must, therefore, be a legal reform in the direction of equalizing as far
as possible the position of the illegitimate and the legitimate child
in relation to the father.</p>

<p>Finally, however, motherhood&mdash;legitimate and illegitimate alike&mdash;is
a factor of such profound importance to society, that it appears
urgently desirable not to leave it exclusively to private care, with all
the results that private care entails. In the interest of the community
it is desirable that there should be</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">A General Insurance of Motherhood</span>,</p>

<p class="noindent">the cost of which should be defrayed by contributions from both
sexes, as well as supplemented by grants from public sources. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
assurance must not only suffice to provide for every woman sufficient
medical assistance and skilled care during pregnancy and delivery,
but should also furnish a provision for the education of the child until
it is of an age to earn its own living.</p>

<p>In order to propagate these views and endeavours methodically
and upon the widest possible foundation, the active assistance and
participation of every class in the population is indispensable. We
therefore urge on all those who share our views the pressing demand</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">to join the Association for the Protection of Mothers</span>,</p>

<p class="noindent">and thus to assist in securing and accelerating the attainment of
these ends.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>As the official organ of the Association, was chosen the monthly
magazine, edited by Dr. Phil. Helene St&ouml;cker, <i>Mutterschutz:
Zeitschrift zur Reform der Sexuellen Ethik</i> (<i>The Protection of
Mothers: a Journal for the Reform of Sexual Ethics</i>)&mdash;hitherto
published in the year 1905 twelve numbers, in the year 1906
twelve numbers, and in the year 1907 three numbers.</p>

<p>The foundation of the Association was followed on February 26,
1905, by the holding of its first public meeting, in the Architektenhaus,
under the presidency of Helene St&ouml;cker; and the meeting
was extensively attended by the general population of Berlin.
The aims and endeavours of the new union were explained, in
longer and shorter speeches, by Ruth Br&eacute;, Max Marcuse, Maria
Lischnewska, Justizrat Sello, Helene St&ouml;cker, Ellen Key, Lily
Braun, Adele Schreiber, Iwan Bloch, and Bruno Meyer; and
from the standpoint of the advocates of woman&#8217;s rights, of
jurists, of physicians, of sociologists, and of moralists, in equal
degree, a radical transformation and reform of the present
untenable conditions was <span class="nowrap">demanded.<a id="FNanchor205"></a><a href="#Footnote205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon afterwards, the Association proceeded to form local groups.
The first was formed in Munich, where on March 28, 1905, the
first local meeting took place. Frau Sch&ouml;nfliess, Margarethe
Joachimsen-B&ouml;hm, Alfred Scheel, and Friedrich Bauer belonged
to this committee. Further local groups were founded in Berlin
(May 20, 1905&mdash;members of this committee, as distinct from
the committee of the general Association: Finkelstein, Galli,
Agnes Hacker, Albert Kohn, Bruno Meyer, Adele Schreiber), and
in Hamburg (president, Regina
<span class="nowrap">Ruben).<a id="FNanchor206"></a><a href="#Footnote206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span></p>

<p>The first general meeting (<i>cf.</i> Helene St&ouml;cker, &#8220;Our First
General Meeting,&#8221; published in <i>Mutterschutz</i>, 1907, No. 2) took
place in Berlin, January 12 to 14. After speeches on the practical
protection of mothers (Maria Lischnewska), the present-day form
of marriage (Helene St&ouml;cker), prostitution and illegitimacy (Max
Flesch), limitation of marriages by economic conditions (Adele
Schreiber), limitation of marriage by hygienic factors (Max Marcuse),
the position of the illegitimate child (B&ouml;hmert and Ottmar
Spann), the insurance of motherhood (Mayet), there followed
animated discussions, and various important resolutions were
passed, dealing with the equality of husband and wife in married
life, the legal recognition of free marriages, and of the offspring
of such marriages, the necessity for the provision of certificates
of health before the conclusion of marriage, the means to be
employed in the care of illegitimate children, and the insurance
of motherhood. Especially noteworthy was the address of the
leading medical statistician, Professor Mayet, regarding the introduction
and management of the insurance of motherhood. At
his suggestion, proposals followed regarding the enrolling of
working-class members in the societies for insurance against illness
and for the insurance of motherhood, the necessity for contributions
on the part of the State, the inclusion of the agricultural and
forest labourers, and of domestic servants of all kinds, in the
schemes of insurance against illness and the insurance of motherhood,
the possibility of a voluntary insurance of all women, what
could be effected by the insurance of motherhood (free provision
of midwives and medical assistance, free lodging in case of need,
the provision of premiums for mothers suckling their own children,
the institution of places where advice could be given to mothers,
of homes for women during pregnancy and child-birth, and homes
for women and infants), and the further development of factory
legislation with regard to nursing mothers. The committee for
1907 was chosen: it consisted of Helene St&ouml;cker, Maria Lischnewska,
Adele Schreiber, Wilhelm Brandt, Iwan Bloch, Max
Marcuse, Heinrich Finkelstein.</p>

<p>In the end of January, 1907, an Austrian Association for the
Protection of Mothers was founded in Vienna, under the presidency
of Dr. Hugo Klein. To the committee of this Society
there belong, Siegmund Freud, Rosa Mayreder, Marie Eugenie<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
delle Grazie, Professor Schauta, and about forty other well-known
persons, physicians, lawyers, schoolmasters, and many women.
In the meeting at which the Association was founded, Dr. Ofner
spoke regarding the legal rights of illegitimate mothers and
children, and Dr. Friedjung regarding the protection of nursing
infants.</p>

<p>In the United States also an Association for sexual reform has
been founded, the so-called &#8220;Umwertungsgesellschaft&#8221; (Revaluation
Society), the principal aim of which is the complete
re-estimation of all values in the amatory life, and the introduction
of a more ideal view of love. The President of this American
Association is Emil F. Ruedebusch; the secretary, Mrs. Lina
Janssen; the meeting-place of the society is Mayville, in the
State of Wisconsin. Regular evenings of discussion are fixed, on
which questions of especial interest are debated.</p>

<p>[In Holland also an Association for the Protection of Mothers
has been founded; its name is &#8220;Vereeniging Onderlinge Vrouwenbescherming.&#8221;]</p>

<p>In the newspaper <i>Mutterschutz</i> (1905, No. 9, pp. 375, 376), we
find a report of the meeting of the American Association held on
October 8, 1905, when the topic of discussion was:</p>

<p><b>What is the true nature of marriage?</b></p>

<p>The answer ran as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Is it the family (parental) relationship?&mdash;No; for a married couple
may have no children, may not desire to have children, and can,
none the less, be thoroughly married.</p>

<p>Is it the common home, domestic life?&mdash;No; for husband and wife
may live their whole life in a hotel, and, none the less, be thoroughly
married.</p>

<p>Is it the lifelong community of material interests?&mdash;No; for
man and wife can keep their property separate, if they wish to
do so.</p>

<p>Is it mutual assistance and a state of comradeship throughout
life?&mdash;No. When a conjugal union is the exact opposite to this,
we speak of a bad husband and a bad wife; they are, none the less,
man and wife.</p>

<p>Does it signify a contract for a lifelong exclusive love?&mdash;Certainly
not; if marriage signified that, all Christians would be opposed to this
institution. And yet these are the things which, according to the
common estimation, make up the nature of marriage, whenever the
question is discussed in a manner which is regarded as &#8220;respectable&#8221;
and &#8220;decent.&#8221;&mdash;As a matter of fact, there is nothing respectable or
decent in this mystification.</p>

<p>What is it, then, in which the true nature of marriage is to be
found?&mdash;It is the possession of a human being for lifelong exclusive
sexual service.</p>

<p>Very various views have prevailed on the question how many<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
human beings it is legitimate for one human being to employ for
his exclusive sexual gratification, and among different nations,
and at various times, the most widely divergent rules and regulations
have prevailed regarding the mode of sexual possession, and, on the
other hand, regarding the duties towards this sexual property; but
wherever marriage has existed, it has signified a right of property in
respect of sexual utilization.</p>

<p>If we oppose marriage, <b>we mean that we oppose that which
actually constitutes marriage according to morality, and according to
written law, that which even the most enthusiastic advocates of this
institution regard as so debasing that they are ashamed to name it
openly</b>.</p>

<p>But, with the exception of the matters relating to sexual service,
<b>we hold fast to and defend everything which is publicly considered as
marriage</b>, and we expect that in this case we shall be &#8220;<b>faithful</b>,&#8221;
&#8220;<b>constant</b>,&#8221; and &#8220;<b>trustworthy</b>&#8221; in all circumstances. For, according
to our view, these most important imponderabilia, and these intimate
associations of interest between husband and wife, are not the inevitable
result of the longing for physical enjoyment in common, but are the
much-to-be-desired result of a well-considered longing for any
one or all of the relations entering into the question. According to
our view, however, the duration of this union, and constancy
while it lasted, would not be dependent upon the activity of sexual
desires.</p>

<p>A special <b>Association for Sexual Reform</b> was founded in
Berlin in the year 1906, at the instance of the editor of the <i>Die
Sch&ouml;nheit</i>, Karl Vanselow. It is an Association of cultured men
and women who also have in view the formation of local groups,
and the delivery of artistic and scientific lectures in furtherance
of their movement for reform.</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned monthly magazine, <i>Mutterschutz</i>,
edited by Helene St&ouml;cker, all the modern problems of love,
marriage, friendship, parentage, prostitution, and all the associated
problems of morality, and of the entire sexual life, are
discussed from their philosophical, historical, legal, medical, social,
and ethical aspects.</p>

<p>The editor herself, a talented disciple of Nietzsche, has since
the year 1893 been chiefly occupied in the study of the psychological
and ethical aspects of the problems of higher love, and has
recently published her collected writings on this subject in a
single <span class="nowrap">volume.<a id="FNanchor207"></a><a href="#Footnote207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an interesting literary physiognomy which is offered to
us in this book; we encounter here a lofty, free, and pure conception
of the love of the future. After the first spiritual wanderings<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
and confusions, which no one in emotional pursuit of the
ideal can escape, we see this courageous and undismayed advocate
of the eternal, inalienable rights of love, ultimately insisting on
the recognition of the lofty mission of love, in accordance with
the saying of Nietzsche, which she lovingly quotes: &#8220;Ye shall
not propagate onwards, but upwards!&#8221; (&#8220;Nicht fort sollt Ihr
Euch pflanzen, sondern hinauf!&#8221;). She especially insists on the
<b>duty</b> and <b>responsibility</b> of individual love. No one can take a
more earnest view of love than is taken here. Helene St&ouml;cker
is throughout no radical revolutionist, but an evolutionist and
reformer. She sees quite clearly that to-day there is no panacea,
no unfailing solution of sexual problems. While she energetically
contests the old sexual morality, and demands its replacement
by a new freer conception of sexual relationships, she, none the
less, recognizes throughout the significance and the value of self-command,
of relative asceticism, the wonderful influence of which,
in the deepening of emotional life, she has most rightly emphasized.
Especially the soul of woman, she believes, has by the
asceticism imposed on women by conventional morality, gained
in a high degree, depth, fulness, and comprehensiveness. The
inward development of woman will be greatly advantaged by the
newer valuation of love. This will be characterized, neither by
an arid renunciation and denial of life, nor by a coarse, egoistic
search for pleasure, but by a joyful affirmation of life and all its
healthy powers and impulses.</p>

<p>Whilst Helene Stocker has laid especial stress upon the psychological
and ethical relationships of free love, its equal importance
from economical and social points of view has been discussed by
Friedrich <span class="nowrap">Naumann,<a id="FNanchor208"></a><a href="#Footnote208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span>
W. <span class="nowrap">Borgius,<a id="FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span> Lily
<span class="nowrap">Braun,<a id="FNanchor210"></a><a href="#Footnote210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span>
Maria <span class="nowrap">Lischnewska,<a id="FNanchor211"></a><a href="#Footnote211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
and Henriette <span class="nowrap">F&uuml;rth.<a id="FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Naumann rightly draws attention to the fact that our purely
monetary economic system is favourable to the production of
sterility, for the reason that in this system motherhood is equivalent
to loss of money, because the wife ceases to earn money in
a degree proportionate to the extent to which she becomes a
mother. The burden of the upbringing of children must be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
an affair of the community. At the present time, on the contrary,
the producer of human beings is burdened upon all sides.
He who has children has more rent to pay, and increased school
expenses. Therefore, Naumann demands, as a first step to the
recognition of the fact that it is a public duty to educate children,
that school expenses shall no longer be demanded from the individual
parent. Above all, however, it must be made easier to
the wife to be a mother.</p>

<p>The wife as a personality demands her right to work, and her
right to motherhood. The fact of the compulsory celibacy of an
ever-increasing number of women competent to become mothers
is the problem which here demands solution. According to the
census of 1900, there were in Germany no less than 4,210,955
women between the ages of eighteen and forty years unmarried,
the total number of women of corresponding age being 9,568,659&mdash;that
is, 44 per cent. were unmarried. Among these there were
2,830,538 between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years,
the period most suitable to child-bearing, the total number of
women of corresponding age being 3,593,644&mdash;that is, no less
than 78 per cent. According to Lily Braun, there remain
from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 German women permanently
unmarried; and we may expect the number of female celibates
to increase. The economic conditions, the previously described
unhealthy conditions of coercive marriage, and the efforts of
women for emancipation, have a combined influence hostile to
marriage. On the other hand, law and conventional morality
co-operate in making life a martyrdom for the unmarried mother
and for the illegitimate <span class="nowrap">child.<a id="FNanchor213"></a><a href="#Footnote213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman who becomes a mother, when united only in the
bonds of free love, is at the present day defamed, despised, a
being without rights. The question of &#8220;<b>maintenance</b>&#8221; is a
scandal of our time! It is the proof of the degree to which most
men are devoid of conscience. An experienced lawyer has very
forcibly described the intolerable conditions which at present
obtain in this <span class="nowrap">matter.<a id="FNanchor214"></a><a href="#Footnote214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span>
He published the following characteristic
letter from a young master-butcher, which shows how meanly<span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span>
even a simple-minded man may endeavour to escape the duty
of maintenance. The letter runs:</p>

<p>Let us imagine the state of mind of the young woman who
receives this letter, characterized as it is by such crafty heartlessness!
And yet this heartlessness is no greater than that of
modern European society, which <b>simultaneously</b> makes fun of
the &#8220;old maid&#8221; and condemns the unmarried mother to infamy.
This double-faced, putrescent &#8220;morality&#8221; is profoundly <b>immoral</b>,
it is <b>radically evil</b>. It is moral and good to contest it with all
our energy, to enter the lists on behalf of the right to free love,
to &#8220;unmarried&#8221; motherhood. Let us make a clearance of this
medieval bugbear of coercive marriage morality, which is a disgrace
in respect of our state of civilization and economical development.
Two million women in a condition of <b>compulsory</b> celibacy
and&mdash;coercive marriage morality. It is merely necessary to place
these two facts side by side, in order to display before our eyes
the complete ethical bankruptcy of our time in the province of
sexual morality.</p>

<p>In addition to this necessity for a radical alteration in sexual
morality, we must, in the second place, enunciate the demand for
a general <b>insurance of motherhood</b>, for <b>the foundation of homes
for pregnant women, for women in child-birth, and for infants</b>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
The fulfilment of these demands alone will bring us a great step
forward in the restoration to health of our sexual life, and in the
preparation of a more beautiful
<span class="nowrap">future.<a id="FNanchor215"></a><a href="#Footnote215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>If it be true, as W. B. Stevenson
<span class="nowrap">reports,<a id="FNanchor216"></a><a href="#Footnote216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span> that King Charles IV.
decreed that all foundling children in Spanish America were to
be regarded as of noble birth, in order that all professions might
be open to them, we cannot but consider that this mode of
thought and action, on the part of a ruler in the country of the
Inquisition, was a shining example for our own time.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Society,&#8221; says Eduard Reich, &#8220;as well as the Church, <b>sins against
the laws of morality, as long as</b> it stands in the way of the advancement
of illegitimate children, either by the maintenance of miserable
prejudices against these poor beings, or by positive decrees. We shall
never be able, even should the human race enter Paradise, to make
it impossible for extra-conjugal procreation to occur: love-children
will always exist. Since, then, it is not the fault of the latter that
their parents have brought them into the world; and, further, since,
even if <b>all</b> men were married, one could not impute it to a man as a
moral transgression, if he, in the plenitude of his procreative powers,
had intercourse with a beautiful girl, instead of with his wife (suffering,
for example, from cancer, or some other serious disease); and since,
on the other hand, a wife still in the full bloom of youth could not
be blamed for unfaithfulness if, her elderly husband having been
impotent for several years, she now has intercourse with a vigorous
and healthy young man&mdash;for such reasons, let us throw the veil of
forgetfulness over all well-intentioned human weaknesses, and no
longer ask whether a citizen of the world has been engendered in the
marriage-bed, or has sprung from the well-spring of love. To the
reasonable being it is the man himself who is of value; and only
blockheads, simpletons, and donkeys will inquire as to his
<span class="nowrap">origin.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor217"></a><a href="#Footnote217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span></p>

<p>And yet one more question I will address in conclusion to the
adherents of coercive marriage morality. <b>How many</b> free-love
relationships, how many illegitimate children have there not been
at all times among the cultured classes, even among the pillars
of the throne and the altar, <b>precisely among those</b> who, on account
of their higher spiritual development, ought to possess a stronger
ethical sensibility (<i>nota bene</i>, from the standpoint of coercive
marriage morality). It would be an interesting task to collect
<b>statistics relating to such free unions, and the resulting</b> &#8220;illegitimate&#8221;
offspring, in the case of notable men and women! The
marriage fanatics would be horrified! Quite apart from the
<b>innumerable secret relationships</b> of this nature, and their consequences,
a short observation and enumeration of the illegitimate
loves and parentage of men and women of high standing, alike
spiritual and moral, would alone suffice to illuminate the actual
conditions, and would enable us to draw remarkable conclusions
regarding coercive marriage. It is my intention, as soon as
possible, to represent in a brief work the r&ocirc;le of free love in the
history of civilization, and to adduce proofs that free love is very
well compatible with a moral life. Who would venture to reproach
with immorality a B&uuml;rger, a Jean Paul, a Gutzkow, a
Karoline Schlegel, a George Sand, or even a
<span class="nowrap">Goethe?<a id="FNanchor218"></a><a href="#Footnote218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a simple evolutionary necessity that free love, in association
with progressive differentiation and with the reshaping of
economic conditions, will find its moral justification also for those
who at present judge and condemn it from the point of view of
long outworn social conditions.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote187"></a><a href="#FNanchor187"><span class="label">[187]</span></a>
One of the most remarkable instances of free love as a popular institution
was the &#8220;island custom&#8221; of the (so-called) Isle of Portland. Here, until well
on into the nineteenth century, experimental cohabitation was universal, and
marriage did not take place until the woman became pregnant. But if, as a
result of this experimental cohabitation, &#8220;the woman does not prove with child,
after a competent time of courtship, they conclude they are not destined by
Providence for each other; they therefore separate; and <b>as it is an established
maxim</b>, which the Portland women observe with great strictness, <b>never to admit
a plurality of lovers at one time</b>, their honour is in no way tarnished. She just
as soon gets another suitor (after the affair is declared to be broken off) as if
she had been left a widow, or that nothing had ever happened, but that she
had remained an immaculate virgin&#8221; (Hutchins, &#8220;History and Antiquities of
the County of Dorset,&#8221; vol. ii., p. 820, 1868). So faithfully was this &#8220;island
custom&#8221; observed that, on the one hand, during a long period no single bastard
was born on the &#8220;island,&#8221; and, on the other, every marriage was fertile. But
when, for the further development of the Portland stone trade, workmen from
London, with the &#8220;wild love&#8221; habits of the large town, came to reside in Portland,
these men took advantage of the &#8220;island custom,&#8221; and then refused to
marry the girls with whom they had cohabited. Thus, in consequence of freer intercourse
with the &#8220;civilized&#8221; world, the &#8220;Portland custom&#8221; has gradually fallen
into desuetude. But the words I have emphasized in the quotation show how
faithfully the conditions of &#8220;free love,&#8221; as defined in this work, were observed in
Portland. An account of Portland, with allusions to the local practice of &#8220;free
love,&#8221; will be found in Thomas Hardy&#8217;s novel, &#8220;The Well Beloved.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

In this connexion English readers will do well to consult Karl Pearson&#8217;s
admirable &#8220;The Ethic of Freethought.&#8221; In the third or sociological section
of that book there are numerous references to the subject of free love in
relation to the economic structure of society. One of these will, however, for
the present, suffice for quotation: &#8220;The economic independence of women will,
for the first time, render it possible for the highest human relationship to become
again a matter of pure affection, raised above every suspicion of restraint and
every taint of commercialism.&#8221; It will be seen that Karl Pearson, like Albert,
Gumplowicz, Bebel, and Socialists in general, believes that collectivism and the
economic independence of women are indispensable preliminaries to a far-reaching
reform of our sex relationships in the direction of free love.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

The facts to which we have alluded throw a peculiar light upon the ever-renewed
attack, made by certain writers who will not see, <i>against</i> the emancipation
of women, whilst at the same time they <i>advocate</i> motherhood! A typical
example of this is the book written by the gynecologist Max Runge, &#8220;Woman
in her Sexual Individuality&#8221; (Berlin, 1896), the objectivity of which, in comparison
with other hostile writings, must, however, be expressly recognized.</p>

The question of <i>unmarried motherhood</i>, sociologically of such profound importance,
has recently been treated by Max Marcuse in an admirable monograph,
&#8220;Unmarried Mothers&#8221; (Berlin, 1907, vol. xxvii. of the &#8220;Documents of
Great Towns,&#8221; edited by Hans Ostwald). Herein we find exact data regarding
the number, religion, position, profession, and characteristics of unmarried
mothers, also the social and psychological causes of unmarried motherhood, and
the existing and future means of caring for women in this position. The same
author, in the newspaper <i>Soziale Medizin und Hygiene</i>, 1906, vol. i., pp. 657-667,
discusses the important question of the <b>adoption</b> of illegitimate children.
Valuable monographs concerning <b>illegitimate children</b> are those of Hugo Neumann,

Child,&#8221; edited by Adele Schreiber, vol. ii., div. 2, pp. 57-61, 62-69 (Leipzig,
1907); the practical work hitherto effected&mdash;already extensive, but still far less
than we could wish&mdash;by the Association for the Protection of Mothers has
been detailed by Maria Lischnewska, in her excellent pamphlet, &#8220;The Practical

Apart from the study of the numerous free-love relationships of the poet
Goethe, it would be interesting to make an investigation regarding his illegitimate
children. Only a few years ago there died in St&uuml;tzerbach one of the last illegitimate
grandchildren of Goethe, a wood-cutter, a man of tall stature and proud
gait, resembling in appearance and demeanour the beloved of all women. <i>Cf.</i>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class="noindent">In the previous chapter we repeatedly drew attention to the fact
that free love is not identical with the sexual promiscuity indulged
in at the present day to such an alarming extent and with such
disastrous consequences&mdash;sexual promiscuity in the form of
extra-conjugal sexual intercourse, irregular in character, and
dependent almost entirely upon chance.</p>

<p>I am an ardent advocate of &#8220;free love,&#8221; by which I understand
sexual union based upon intimate love, personal harmony, and
spiritual affinity, entered on by the free resolve of both parties,
involving the assumption of all the duties entailed by such free
unions, and with satisfactory mutual assurances regarding health.
But with corresponding emphasis I must condemn, from the
standpoint of the physician and from that of public hygiene, and
also on ethical grounds, the now so widely diffused &#8220;extra-conjugal&#8221;
sexual intercourse, for which, in order to distinguish
it from the entirely different extra-conjugal &#8220;free&#8221; love, I
suggest the term &#8220;<b>wild love</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This wild love is the true cancer of our society, for its chief
characteristic is that it constitutes <b>an enduring connexion and
means of transition</b> between hygienically and ethically unexceptionable
sexual intercourse and prostitution, and thus involves
the unceasing risk of transferring to the former <b>all the dangers</b>
of the latter. In this sense, wild love can really be regarded as
a kind of <b>irradiation</b> of the whole nature of prostitution into the
entirety of sexual relations in general. Thus, it remains a powerful
hindrance to all ennoblement and resanation of the amatory
life, and it is an invincible source of the moral and physical degeneration
and the infective contamination of the nation.</p>

<p>Wild love is intimately connected with the artificial sensual
life of our time, and with the manifold varieties of
<span class="nowrap">seduction<a id="FNanchor219"></a><a href="#Footnote219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
arising from that life. Wild love, the sensual life, and seduction,
form, as it were, a triad, each member of which is the principal
predisposing condition of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span></p>

<p>He who wishes to characterize in a few words the European
civilization of the present day may say that its nature consists in
<b>epicureanism</b>, mitigated by <b>toil</b> and the <b>struggle for life</b>; but this
epicureanism is of a very peculiar kind. It is no longer the
unqualified sensual life of the eighteenth century, in which sensual
lusts and epicurean refinements were to many the whole object
of life, nor is it the comfortable enjoyment of &#8220;the good old
times&#8221;; it is a quite peculiar <b>concentrated</b> enjoyment of the
moment, <b>in the midst of the hard work of life</b>. The <i>carpe diem</i>
of Horace has to-day become <i>carpe horam</i>!</p>

<p>The forced labour which the fierce struggle for existence at
present entails upon the majority of men leaves no more time
for a simple undisturbed enjoyment of existence, for the inward
deep <b>experience</b> of reality, and for a quiet joy therein. No, our
sensual life of to-day bears in it the sting of <b>pain</b>, because the
will to live, which, according to Schopenhauer, continually strives
for an &#8220;<b>increase of life</b>,&#8221; has now degenerated into a convulsive
search for <b>the most violent sensations possible</b>, into a wild hunt
after the strongest possible and most frequent enjoyments,
because the time is lacking for a peaceful, harmonious existence.
Each man asks himself anxiously whether he may not have
&#8220;missed&#8221; this or that possibility of objective pleasure; and
forgets in doing so that the true happiness of life lies <b>within
himself</b>, and that the greatest possible sum of outward enjoyments
cannot procure him this happiness.</p>

<p>The signature of our time is &#8220;<b>amuse oneself</b>,&#8221; a phrase which
conveys the idea of all our modern superficial pleasures, and of
our sensual and spiritual sensations, which must chase one
another in rapid succession in order to enable the modern civilized
man to feel that he &#8220;lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the majority of those living in great towns, amusement is
equivalent to a <b>continued succession of superficial sensual
pleasures, as preparatory stimuli for an equally fugitive and
debasing sexual act</b>.</p>

<p>The frequently heard and favourite phrases &#8220;to go through
with it,&#8221; &#8220;to live one&#8217;s life,&#8221; &#8220;to sow one&#8217;s wild oats,&#8221; etc.,
have all the same significance, in the sense of preparation for
sexual indulgence by means of such stimuli.</p>

<p>From beer-saloons and public-houses of all kinds, especially
those at which the attendants are women, from the cabarets and
variety theatres, the low-class music-halls and dancing-saloons,
also, however, from better-class balls, soir&eacute;es, and luxurious
dinners, the road is open to the prostitute, or to the arms of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
girl excited by similar sensual stimuli to a similarly transitory
sexual desire.</p>

<p>A great physician has said: &#8220;We eat three times too much.&#8221;
I might add, in amplification of this saying, Not only do we eat
three times too much, but we look for all other sensual pleasures
in excess, and for this reason <b>we love also three times too much</b>,
or rather, we indulge <b>too often</b> in sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>One of our most talented psychologists, Willy Hellpach, has
described these relationships with great insight:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;To the enormous majority of our young men sexual indulgence is
a matter of course, like their card-parties, their evenings at the club,
their glass of beer; and of the few who live otherwise, a considerable
proportion do so simply from timidity, or from poverty of spirit (they
would like to, but they cannot screw their courage up). Another
portion is honourably continent, but does not dare to make any display
of this adhesion to principle, and rather pretends not to be distinguished
in any way from the majority; and the very few young
men who openly set their faces against the custom may be counted
on the fingers of one hand. It is obvious that in this way the extra-conjugal
sexual act loses the distinction of the unaccustomed; it is
effected continually in a more heedless, light-hearted, frivolous manner&mdash;until,
finally, the very idea of danger connected with indiscriminate
sexual indulgence is forgotten; the preventive is thrown aside with
an easy &#8220;Nothing has ever happened to me.&#8221; Indeed, many a man
goes to his fate in the shape of infection with his eyes open, and with
the most light-hearted confidence: if he is infected, there will be plenty
of time before his marriage to be thoroughly cured.</p>

<p>&#8220;This factor comes the more readily into play in proportion to the
degree in which the whole arrangement of the sensual life culminates
in the stimulation of erotic activities. Such a tendency is inevitably
associated with the development of the modern large town; and there
ensues an imitation of the sensual life of large towns in smaller towns,
and even in country <span class="nowrap">villages.<a id="FNanchor220"></a><a href="#Footnote220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Every large town provides the means for a much more extensive
stimulation of the senses than country life; and the alternate stimulation
and deadening of the senses, characteristic of town life, has in
the very large towns of our time reached an unheard-of degree of
intensity. The town is the typical habitat of that sensual and nervous
condition of irritability which historically characterizes our own
generation; the townsman is the typical representative of &#8220;nervousness&#8221;
in its modern form. The verbal connexion between &#8220;senses&#8221;
and &#8220;sensuality&#8221; represents an actual transition; and in ordinary
parlance, by the &#8220;sensual&#8221; we understand the &#8220;erotic.&#8221; Where
the senses are more strongly stimulated, there erotic desire grows,
there it loses its periodical course in favour of a continuous wakefulness,
or, at any rate, in favour of a light slumber, which the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span>
stimulus will disturb. And the townsman is more easily impelled
to the sexual act, not merely because the town offers him prostitutes,
&#8220;intimates,&#8221; etc., in much greater numbers, but also because his over-stimulated
nervous system impels him much more powerfully to search
for these objects, and makes it much more difficult for him to safeguard
himself against their allurements.</p>

<p>&#8220;And town life is nocturnal life! The more so, the larger the town;
and we see the extreme form of this in the great capitals of Europe.
The consequences in regard to the opportunities for and incitations to
sexual enjoyment are not lacking. First of all, nocturnal life gives
rise to a summation of stimuli, to an incredible variety of nervous
titillation, and this induces an increasing sensuality; and once the
sensual life has become habitually nocturnal, now, by a vicious circle,
all enjoyment is unavoidably fettered to the town. Natural recuperation
has become a secondary consideration, and in place of the
relief of tension, we have apparent restoration by means of variety.
All, all, tends in favour of a sharpening of sensual stimuli, of arousing
the wish for erotic pleasures. And the town is untiring, inexhaustible,
in its discovery of means for the gratification of these instincts. Variety
theatres, gin-palaces, low music-halls, and all the amusements of
similar kind, are simply unthinkable without the sensual note; and
even where they maintain themselves to be free from that note, it
will be unconsciously sought by the audience, will be easily found,
and if it were absent, its absence would be angrily resented. The
same is true, more or less, of entertainments of a higher &aelig;sthetic rank.
With very few exceptions, our theatres are compelled to take into
consideration the instincts of the public, and the instincts of the
population of our large towns are chiefly concerned with eroticism.
Even where sexual questions are elevated into the sphere of the
highest art, and by the artist himself the common is detested, the
audience will, after their kind, merely extract erotic stimulation;
and that the opera and the stage are sought by many merely on
account of these accessory influences, is too well known to need proof&mdash;not
to say a word regarding the pantomime and the ballet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the worst of all is yet to come. In his public dinners,
his parties, his clubs, his balls, etc., the man of the upper classes, and
also the man of the middle classes, does not find the much-to-be-desired
ethical counterpoise to this characteristic sensual life of our
young men; but rather finds the prolongation of it in a somewhat
more masked and artificial form. From the outset, the relationship
between the sexes is of so suggestive, so purposive a character, that
this exercises a gentle, stimulating influence upon desire; and a
man is thrown into a state of tension for which he often finds only one
outlet, sexual gratification&mdash;which he must either buy or obtain by
cunning&mdash;and thus he passes straightway from the influences of the
public sensual life, to become the customer of the prostitute, the
partner in the &#8220;intimacy,&#8221; the seducer in the nocturnal life of the
great town. He then either runs the danger of infection with venereal
diseases, or he occupies himself with their dissemination; for the man
suffering from venereal disease is not merely a victim: he is commonly
also a focus of infection, one who finds new victims in the
shape of girls hitherto uninfected.</p>

<p>&#8220;To this evil a remarkable trait in the sensual life of the simpler<span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span>
woman extends ready assistance&mdash;I mean that servility, that erotic
obsequiousness which finds expression already in the gossip, and in
the favourite reading of the lower classes, and which makes them feel
to some extent flattered if they are treated as means of enjoyment by
a man of good position. It is well known that the prostitute in her
talk gladly makes her lover a baron; but, unfortunately, a similar
tendency characterizes the feminine half of the lower classes throughout,
and to our regret, this is more especially true of the German
people. Our commercial-traveller nature, to which, according to
Sombart, we owe a portion of our ascendancy in the markets of the
world, finds its most regrettable and disastrous seamy side in the
readiness with which the masses forget their pride and self-respect,
when it is a question of snatching a pleasure. This characteristic has,
in recent lustra, unfortunately become not better, but rather worse;
the desire to look well at any cost, with which the simple girl so often
makes herself laughable, inspires also her longing to &#8216;walk out&#8217; with
a distinguished <span class="nowrap">admirer.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor221"></a><a href="#Footnote221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>But not only does the simple girl of the people sacrifice her
life and health in this pursuit of pleasure; the young men also
are not behindhand in the pursuit, which they regard as &#8220;gentlemanlike,&#8221;
of enjoyment and of women. It is astonishing what
an increase in recent times there has been in the number of
youthful embezzlers, learners and clerks in merchants&#8217; offices,
whose offences have been committed simply in order to provide
funds for the gratification of their pothouse pleasures. Among
them one meets lads between the ages of fourteen and eighteen
years, a symptom of the earlier sexual maturity of the present
day. When, as usually happens, they are arrested after a few
days, it comes out in evidence that the embezzled money was
squandered in the society of prostitutes, but we learn that the
tendency to such excess had existed in the embezzler long before
he actually committed a crime. If the heads of businesses were
to keep themselves better informed regarding the mode of life
of their employees, many a disillusion and many a loss would be
spared them.</p>

<p>Sexual seduction is at the present time effected less by individuals
than by the environment. <b>The sensual life as such</b>, the
entire stimulating sensual atmosphere of that life, plays to-day
a r&ocirc;le which at an earlier time, when our social life and
pleasures were less fully developed, fell to the &#8220;seducer,&#8221; the
<i>galant homme</i> and Don Juan of earlier days. Our young people
are subjected rather to the general influences of the pursuit of
amusement, which fascinates all circles, than to the allurements<span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span>
of the habitual seducer. <b>To-day, the victims of public seduction,
by means of the sensual life characteristic of our time, are far
more numerous</b> than those seduced by isolated individuals,
though such there have been, and will be, at all times.</p>

<p>Before I pass to the consideration of the individual influences
of the modern sensual life, those by which wild love is especially
favoured, and before I describe the general seduction of the
present day, I propose to touch upon the interesting question of
&#8220;<b>professional seduction</b>,&#8221; to consider Don-Juanism and the
practice of the &#8220;<i>ars amandi</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is remarkable how strongly the history of the art of seduction
reflects the general tendency of the evolution of love from
purely physical impulses to spiritual love. This we learn simply
from the study of the numerous <b>text-books of the art of love</b>, the
so-called &#8220;<i>ars amandi</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereas in the earlier text-books of this subject, from Ovid&#8217;s
&#8220;Ars <span class="nowrap">Amandi,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor222"></a><a href="#Footnote222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span>
widely celebrated in antiquity, to the &#8220;Practica
Artis <span class="nowrap">Amandi,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor223"></a><a href="#Footnote223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>

<span class="nowrap">Aimer,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor224"></a><a href="#Footnote224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span> of
the seventeenth century, and Gentil Bernard&#8217;s &#8220;L&#8217;Art
<span class="nowrap">d&#8217;Aimer,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor225"></a><a href="#Footnote225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>
of the eighteenth century, the principal stress was laid upon all
the possible sensual stimuli, and upon the superficial gallantry
associated with this; in the modern text-books, in that of
<span class="nowrap">Manso<a id="FNanchor226"></a><a href="#Footnote226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span>
(still belonging to the eighteenth century), but especially
in the more recent works by <span class="nowrap">Stendhal,<a id="FNanchor227"></a><a href="#Footnote227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
Paul <span class="nowrap">Bourget,<a id="FNanchor228"></a><a href="#Footnote228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>

<span class="nowrap">Kj&ouml;lenson,<a id="FNanchor232"></a><a href="#Footnote232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>
we find much more stress laid on all the <b>spiritual</b>
influences of the art of love. In this way it is possible to follow
in these works the whole course of the enrichment of the spiritual
and emotional life in <span class="nowrap">love.<a id="FNanchor233"></a><a href="#Footnote233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The same process of development can be recognized also in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
figure of Don Juan. His type has undergone gradual alteration,
always becoming more and more intellectual. The <b>purely sensual</b>
Don Juan, as Lord Chesterfield, for example, characterizes and
embodies him, is to-day quite out of date even among sensual
men of the ordinary type; whereas though Kierkegaard&#8217;s &#8220;Diary
of a Seducer&#8221; describes an extreme type, that of the purely
reflective libertine, yet in this extreme, the author has very
rightly recognized the general tendency of evolution.</p>

<p>Recently, Oscar A. H. Schmitz has published an extremely
original and thoughtful study of &#8220;Don Juan, Casanova, and
other Erotic Characters&#8221; (Stuttgart, 1906), in which he distinguishes
very sharply the seducer type of a Casanova from the
seducer-type of a Don Juan. Don Juan is a deceitful, cunning
seducer, to whom the <b>sense of possession</b> associated with the
attainment of his aim, the <b>danger</b>, the activity of his <b>desires for
power and dominance</b>, are the principal matters, but who is in
himself <b>unerotic</b>; whereas Casanova is pre-eminently the erotic,
also crafty and deceitful, not, however, for the gratification of
his need for power, but rather for the agreeable satisfaction of
his need for sensual love. Don Juan knows only &#8220;women&#8221;;
for Casanova each one is &#8220;the woman.&#8221; Don Juan is demoniacal,
devilish he goes on to the complete destruction of the women
seduced by him, deliberately he ensures their unhappiness;
Casanova is human, cares always for the happiness of the women
he loves, and devotes to them a tender reflection. Don Juan
<b>despises</b> women, he is of the type of the misogynist, of the satanic
woman-hater; Casanova is the typical feminist, he possesses a
profound understanding of woman&#8217;s soul, is not disappointed by
love, and needs for his life&#8217;s happiness continuous contact with
feminine natures. Don Juan seduces by means of his own
elemental nature, by the attractive power of brutal wild force;
Casanova does so by means of the sensual atmosphere which
surrounds him.</p>

<p>With an accurate psychological insight, Schmitz remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It seems as if the love of one, or, where possible, of several, women
inoculates the man, as it were, with a vital fluid, and gives his glance
a fire which at times makes him irresistible. Men of pleasure declare
that after the most fortunate nights, when, exhausted, they were
returning home to sleep, on the way the most eager and meaning
glances were cast upon them by the women whom they passed.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This distinction between the two types of seducer, which
Schmitz makes in his original book, containing excellent observations
on the psychology of love, is indeed not new. Stendhal, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span>
the chapter &#8220;Werther and Don Juan&#8221; of his book, &#8220;Ueber die
Liebe,&#8221; pp. 241-251 (German edition, Leipzig, 1903), points out
the same types. &#8220;The genuine Don Juans,&#8221; he says, &#8220;ultimately
come to regard women as their enemies, and find actual
pleasure in their manifold unhappiness&#8221;; whereas Werther, the
equivalent of Casanova, regards all women as entrancing beings,
towards whom we are far too unjust. The love of Don Juan is
&#8220;a similar feeling to the love of the chase&#8221;; Werther&#8217;s love is
gentle, idealizes the reality, is full of tender and romantic impressions.
Don Juan is the conqueror; Werther is the erotic.</p>

<p>I myself also, in my work on &#8220;Sexual Life in England,&#8221; vol. ii.,
p. 159 (Berlin, 1903), have, earlier than Schmitz, clearly distinguished
from one another these two seducer types, in a passage
in which I depict the British Don Juan, in contrast to the
French and Italian Don Juan.</p>

<p>The passage runs:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The principal characteristic of the British Don Juans, who are
completely distinct from the libertines of the Latin and of the other
Teutonic countries, is the <b>cold, brazen</b> quietude with which they
indulge in the sensual pleasures of life; <b>love is much less to them an
affair of passion than one of pride and of the gratification of their
consciousness of power</b>. The French, the Italian Don Juan is driven
by ardent sensuality from conquest to conquest. This is the <b>principal
motive</b> of their actions and of their mode of life. The English Don
Juan seduces on principle, for the sake of experiment; he pursues
love as a sport. Sensuality plays a part only in the second degree,
and in the midst of his sensual enjoyment the coldness of his heart is
still painfully apparent.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the <b>rake</b>, the type of <b>Lovelace</b>, which Richardson, in his
&#8216;Clarissa Harlowe,&#8217; has described with incomparable mastery.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Taine, also, in his &#8220;History of English Literature,&#8221; has described
this British Don-Juanism, which hates rather than loves.</p>

<p>Finally, we find these types also in Rosa Mayreder&#8217;s book,
&#8220;Zur Kritik der Weiblicheit&#8221; (&#8220;Critique of Femininity,&#8221; Leipzig,
1905), especially in the chapter, &#8220;A Few Words on the Powerful
Faust&#8221; (pp. 210-243). Her type of the &#8220;<b>masterful erotic</b>&#8221;
closely resembles the Don Juan type of Schmitz, and my own
British seducer type.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Erotic excitement,&#8221; says Rosa Mayreder, &#8220;gives rise in these
men to the lust of dominion; to them the relationship with women
signifies a grasping possession, an enjoyment of power, and they are
unable to think of women except as subject and dependent. Only
in so far as woman adapts herself to them as a means do they know
her; as a personality, with individual aims, she does not exist for
them.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span></p>

<p>This masterful eroticism exists among men of quite low social
position, just as much as among men of high
<span class="nowrap">position.<a id="FNanchor234"></a><a href="#Footnote234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span> Their
diametrical opposite is the love-perception of delicately sensitive,
erotical, highly differentiated men, whose highest type constitutes
the &#8220;<b>erotic genius</b>.&#8221; Rosa Mayreder characterizes this latter
type in the following terms:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The increasing differentiation of erotic perception brings with it
a new faculty, which extinguishes the consciousness of superiority
and transforms the need for contrast into the need for community,
for reciprocity&mdash;the capacity for devotion. Thus comes to pass the
most remarkable phenomenon in the masculine psyche, the great
miracle, which effects a complete transformation of the primitive
mode of perception, a transformation of the teleological sexual
nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;The erotic genius grasps the nature of the opposite sex with
intuitive understanding, and is capable of assimilating it completely.
The other sex is to him the primevally akin and primevally allied;
his love-relationships are accompanied by ideas of enlargement,
fulfilment, liberation of his own essential nature, or even by the idea
of a mystical union. To him sexuality does not denote an annulment
or limitation of personality, but rather an enlargement and enrichment
by means of the individuals with which, in this way, his personality
is associated.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>As an erotic genius of such a kind, Rosa Mayreder points to
Richard Wagner, as he manifests himself in his letters to Mathilde
Wesendonk.</p>

<p>The sensibility and refinement of the modern woman, her
emergence as a personality, must continually repel the masterful
type of erotic&mdash;although doubtless that type will never be entirely
eliminated. I do not believe in a complete transformation of
the teleological sexual nature of man, which has always assigned
to him the active aggressive r&ocirc;le. But it is true that the possibilities
of existence for the masterful erotic, the Don Juan type,
have become limited. He must, as Schmitz rightly insists, intellectualize
himself if he wishes to continue to exist. This psychological
satanism of the modern Don Juan is wonderfully described
by Kierkegaard, in his &#8220;Diary of a
<span class="nowrap">Seducer.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor235"></a><a href="#Footnote235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The hero of this book learns best from the girls themselves how
they can be betrayed; he develops in them &#8220;spiritual eroticism,&#8221;
in order then suddenly to abandon them, but <b>they themselves</b>
must loosen the tie. Woman and love are not to him in themselves
the principal need; what is important to him is, as he says<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
at the conclusion, that he has been able to enrich himself with
numerous erotic perceptions. The modern Don Juan is, therefore,
nothing more than a <b>cold psychological experimenter</b>. It is
in this way that, with prophetic insight, Choderlos de Laclos has
described him in the Vicomte de Valmont, the hero of his &#8220;Liaisons
Dangereuses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet another interesting Don Juan type of our time has to be
considered, one which indeed is not a genuine Don Juan, but a
<b>pseudo</b> Don Juan, or rather a pseudo Casanova; and this type
makes its appearance also in the female sex.</p>

<p>Like R&eacute;tif de la Bretonne, it is the man or woman seeking
eternally for the ideal, for true love; a type which only, in consequence
of the ever-repeated disillusions and errors, assumes a Don
Juanesque character. At the present day, we meet this type
very often. It is only the expression of the increasing difficulty
of the proper love choice, owing to the progressive differentiation
of our time; and it is not originated by the desire for sensual lust,
but rather by the eternally disillusioned yearning for genuine
individual love.</p>

<p>But we must return after this excursion to the consideration
of the commonest type of public seduction by means of the sensual
life of our time. It is significant that this also possesses its
literary guides and course of instruction, in the form of the
numerous printed <b>handbooks for the world of pleasure</b>. Among
these we may mention, &#8220;Guides du Viveur,&#8221; &#8220;Guides de Plaisir,&#8221;
&#8220;F&uuml;hrer durch das N&auml;chtliche Berlin&#8221; (&#8220;Guide to Berlin by
Night&#8221;), &#8220;New London Guide to the Night Houses,&#8221; &#8220;Die
Geheimnisse der Berliner Passage&#8221; (&#8220;Secrets of the &#8216;Passage&#8217;
of Berlin&#8221;), &#8220;Paris by Night,&#8221; &#8220;The Swell&#8217;s Night Guide
through the Metropolis,&#8221; &#8220;Bruxelles la Nuit, Physiologie des
&Eacute;tablissements Nocturnes de Bruxelles&#8221; (for Englishmen of
pleasure, published under the title of &#8220;Brussels by Gas-light&#8221;),
&#8220;Paris and Brussels after Dark,&#8221; &#8220;The Gentleman&#8217;s Night
Guide,&#8221; &#8220;Hamburgs galante H&auml;user bei Nacht und Nebel&#8221;
(&#8220;Hamburg&#8217;s Fast Houses by Night and Cloud&#8221;), &#8220;Das Galante
Berlin,&#8221; &#8220;Naturgeschichte der galanten Frauen in Berlin&#8221;
(&#8220;Natural History of the Fast Women of Berlin&#8221;), &#8220;Paris
Intime et Myst&eacute;rieux,&#8221; &#8220;Guide des Plaisirs Mondains et des
Plaisirs Secrets &agrave; Paris.&#8221; All these have appeared during the
last thirty years, some of them in several editions. For Vienna,
Buda-Pesth, St. Petersburg, Rome, Milan, Barcelona, Madrid,
Marseilles, Rotterdam, and New York, there also exist such
guides to all open and secret enjoyments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span></p>

<p>In order to give an idea of the contents of such a guide to the
sensual life, I need merely enumerate the chapter headings of a
book published in 1905, and, as the Paris bookseller from whom
I obtained it informed me, immediately confiscated, but <b>none
the less</b> still openly sold in the bookshops of the Boulevards and
the Rue de Rivoli. It bears the title, &#8220;<b>Pour s&#8217;Amuser</b>. Guide
du Viveur &agrave; Paris, par Victor Leca&#8221; (Paris, 1905). In his versified
dedication, the compiler writes:</p>

<p>And he states in the preface that all the various pleasures of
Paris, for the eye, the ear, and the sense of taste, lead ultimately
to&mdash;woman, in complete agreement with the definition which
I gave above of the sensual life of our time. All these
pleasures concur in leading to sexual indulgence&mdash;that is the end,
the climax of every &#8220;amusement,&#8221; the true <i>punctum saliens</i> of
the life of pleasure of our large towns. Thus Leca, in his comprehensive
and elaborate guide for men of pleasure, lays the
principal stress on announcements regarding eroticism and on
opportunities for erotic adventures in the individual places of
pleasure. He enumerates these in series: the theatre, especially
the &#8220;th&eacute;&acirc;tres tr&egrave;s l&eacute;gers,&#8221; the &#8220;caf&eacute;s-concerts,&#8221; the dancing-saloons,
the hippodromes, and circuses, the cabarets of Montmartre,
the Quartier Latin, the women&#8217;s caf&eacute;s, the boulevards,
the halls of the central market, the brothels (with an exact indication
of the streets, and with the numbers of the houses!!), the
houses of accommodation (<i>maisons de rendezvous</i>), the likenesses
of a few &#8220;ladies of pleasure,&#8221; the arcades, the parks and public
gardens, the popular festivals, the races, drives, public bathing
establishments, cemeteries, museums, and exhibitions&mdash;all, always,
in relation to the feminine element.</p>

<p>These handbooks of the art of enjoyment are existing proofs,
from the point of view of the history of civilization, of the fact
<b>that the sexual impulse is, in every possible way, influenced,
increased, elaborated, and complicated, by the civilization of the
present day</b>. Especially the life of great towns, where the
essence of modern civilization is found in its most concentrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
form, is a sexual stimulant in the highest degree, with its haste
and hunting, its &#8220;nocturnal
<span class="nowrap">life,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor236"></a><a href="#Footnote236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
with its multiplicity of enjoyments
for all the senses, with its gastronomic and alcoholic excesses&mdash;in
short, with its new device that after work comes
<b>pleasure</b>, and not repose.</p>

<p>In my &#8220;Sexual Life in England&#8221; (vol. ii., p. 261 <i>et seq.</i>) I
have described the momentous influence of the mode of life upon
sexuality, and have proved how both in the old England and in
the new the excessive consumption of meat and of alcoholic
beverages has unnaturally stimulated the sexual impulse, and
has conducted it into devious paths.</p>

<p>But of Germany also we may say that, apart from the times
of &#8220;meat famine,&#8221; we eat <b>too much meat</b> and drink <b>too much
alcohol</b>, the former especially among the higher classes, the latter
among all classes of society.</p>

<p>The sexually stimulating influence of luxurious feeding, which,
for example, Gabriele d&#8217;Annunzio describes in the early part of
his romance &#8220;Lust,&#8221; and which Tolstoi, in the &#8220;Kreutzer
Sonata,&#8221; describes as the principal cause of incitation to lasciviousness,
is indeed a well-known fact of experience; and the
<b>later</b> in the day these heavy meals are consumed, the more
dangerous are they in respect of their influence on the sexual
impulse. I am fully convinced that the good old German custom
of taking the principal meal of the day at noon <b>is greatly preferable</b>
to the so-called &#8220;English dinner,&#8221; when the principal
meal is deferred to four or six o&#8217;clock. Luxurious suppers, or
even midnight dinners, such as at the present day are quite
customary, must be definitely regarded as aphrodisiac.</p>

<p>A far more momentous r&ocirc;le is played by <b>alcohol</b> in the modern
sensual life. A writer who is not himself a strict teetotaller may
yet feel it his duty to lay all possible stress on this fact. Indeed,
from the standpoint of medical experience and observation, I am
prepared to term alcohol the <b>evil genius</b> of the modern sexual
life, because in a malicious and underhand manner it delivers its
victim to sexual misleading and corruption, to venereal infection,
and to all the consequences of casual sexual
<span class="nowrap">intercourse.<a id="FNanchor237"></a><a href="#Footnote237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>This is not the place for a detailed discussion of the drink
question, or for stating the reasons for my own opinion, that
complete abstinence is a Utopian idea, and that the <b>moderate</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
and careful use of alcohol, in quantities suited to the particular
individuality, and at <b>suitable</b> times, does no harm worth mentioning.
Though this be so, I cannot fail to recognize the deeply
tragic r&ocirc;le which the customary abuse of alcohol plays in the
sexual corruption of our time. As to the connexion between
alcohol and the sexual life, I must therefore speak at greater
<span class="nowrap">length.<a id="FNanchor238"></a><a href="#Footnote238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of alcohol upon the sexual life and upon the
psyche is a very peculiar one. Beer or wine, taken in <b>very
moderate</b> quantities, unquestionably give rise, in addition to their
general psychical stimulating influence, to sexual excitement of
greater or less degree. This sexual excitement, if more alcohol
is now taken, endures <b>longer</b> than the psychical excitement, which
soon gives place to psychical paralysis, to a discontinuance of
the inhibitory influences proceeding from the brain. It is in this
unequal influence exercised upon the purely sensual-sexual and
upon the psychical processes, that the peculiar danger of alcoholic
excesses appears to me to depend. The sexual stimulation produced
by the first draught of alcohol continues at a time when
the man has already lost all control over reason and will, and
thus he becomes an easy prey to sexual seduction.</p>

<p>It is only in this way that we can explain the momentous influence
of alcohol, for we know, generally speaking, it is not a means
for the increase of sexual power. On the contrary, it increases
voluptuousness and sexual desire, but almost always hinders
erection and delays the sexual orgasm.</p>

<p><b>Thus, a man under the influence of alcohol requires a longer
time for the completion of the act of sexual intercourse than a
sober man</b>, and in this way the danger of venereal infection is
notably increased, for the contact with the infecting person is
considerably longer. I have inquired of many patients who were
infected during intercourse with prostitutes after alcoholic excess,
and was almost always informed that the act of intercourse,
owing to the well-known relative impotence produced by alcohol,
was exceptionally long in duration, and this naturally gave more<span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span>
opportunity for excessive contact, for mechanical injuries dependent
upon increased friction, etc., and thus brought about infection.</p>

<p>In medical literature, numerous cases are reported in which
two men have completed intercourse with an infected prostitute,
shortly after one another, and, remarkable to relate, one only
became infected, whilst the other remained healthy. More exact
inquiry would show without doubt in many such cases that the
uninfected man was sober, in comparison with the infected man,
who must have been under the influence of alcohol.</p>

<p>In the case of women, with regard to whom there can be no
question of any specific effect upon sexual &#8220;potency,&#8221; the
influence of alcohol in exciting libido, in association with its
withdrawal of all psychical inhibitions, makes itself all the more
manifest. Thus, to woman, who, speaking generally, is far more
intolerant of the drug than man, very moderate enjoyment of
alcohol entails <span class="nowrap">dangers.<a id="FNanchor239"></a><a href="#Footnote239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The seducer, the procuress, and the prostitute are all familiar
with the above-described peculiar influence of alcohol upon the
libido sexualis and upon the psyche, and it is precisely this discriminative
duplex influence which is utilized by them. Not
only in the so-called &#8220;Animierkneipen&#8221;&mdash;that is, the drinking-saloons
with women attendants&mdash;and in the brothels does
alcohol subserve this purpose, but the street-walkers also await
their victims by preference outside the doors of the great restaurants,
or after festival dinners, and keep an eye especially
on drunken men, because in the case of these, in whom all self-command
has been lost, they have, in every respect, an easy
<span class="nowrap">prey.<a id="FNanchor240"></a><a href="#Footnote240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span></p>

<p>A man under the influence of alcohol is as easily led and as
devoid of will-power as a child. He is not particular in his
choice: he generally fails to notice whether the prostitute who
accosts him is young or old, pretty or ugly, clean or dirty; he
follows her blindly, and in most cases with results disastrous to
his pocket and to his health. The following case illustrates very
clearly this loss of will produced in a man by indulgence in
alcohol:</p>

<p>An officer of high rank, a married man, in general a man of
solid repute, left the officers&#8217; casino after a banquet late at night,
very tipsy, to seek his house. Suddenly he felt an arm thrust
into his; it was a prostitute who had noticed his condition, and
she had turned it to her own advantage. Without reflection and
without exercise of will, he allowed her to lead him to her dwelling,
and there, still in a quite apathetic condition, had intercourse
with her, without taking any precautions whatever. It was not
until afterwards that he saw, being then somewhat sobered, that
he was in the company of an elderly prostitute of the lowest
class. His dread of venereal infection was justified a few days
later by the appearance of a urethral discharge. In great alarm
he consulted me. Microscopic examination of the urethral secretion,
and the cure which ensued in a few days, showed me that
he was suffering from a simple urethral catarrh, and not from
gonorrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>Such cases as this, however, do not always end so fortunately.
It is notorious, and has been proved by the researches of leading
physicians and medical statisticians, that the majority of venereal
infections take place under the influence of alcohol.</p>

<p>For this reason, <b>the continued increase in the consumption of
alcohol leads to a further diffusion of venereal diseases</b>. While
our ancestors consumed alcoholic beverages to excess only on
Sundays and festival days, at the present time spirits are freely
consumed on weekdays&mdash;above all, during the evenings. Brandy
and beer have become everyday beverages, especially beer, whose
consumption increases year by year, so that in the year 1898 the
beer drunk in Germany was valued at &pound;100,000,000! Str&uuml;mpell
showed that labourers earning three marks a day are accustomed
to spend eighty pfennige&mdash;that is, more than one-third of their
income&mdash;on beer; these are by no means notorious drinkers, but
steady fellows who only follow the general &#8220;custom.&#8221; The part
played by beer in Germany is played by absinthe in France; the
well-known &#8220;ap&eacute;ritif&#8221; to which prostitutes of Paris so often
invite their male clients is in most cases absinthe. Wine, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
experienced Fiaux says, is merely an &#8220;ideal drink&#8221; in the dreams
of the ordinary Parisian prostitute.</p>

<p>We shall return in subsequent chapters of this work to the
consideration of alcohol in its relations to the sexual life in
general, and to abnormal sexual manifestations in particular.
We shall also have occasion to speak of the momentous r&ocirc;le
played by alcohol in the causation of offences against morality.
Baer goes so far as to assert that alcohol is the cause in 77 per
cent. of such offences.</p>

<p>Here we shall only once more insist upon the high degree to
which the excessive enjoyment of alcohol assists in seduction and
favours wild love&mdash;that is, sexual intercourse free from all choice
and all regulation. This is to be seen with especial clearness at
popular festivals and other occasions giving rise to alcoholic
excesses; and the effects are later shown by the resulting increase
in the number of illegitimate births.</p>

<p>Magnus Hirschfeld relates that when he was a student he spent
one Christmas Eve in the company of a professor of medicine in
Breslau. Among the guests were two of the maternity assistants,
and first one, then the other, was called away to attend confinements.
An old physician who was present thereupon remarked:
&#8220;Yes, yes; these are the children of the Emperor&#8217;s birthday.&#8221;
Hirschfeld, who asked for an explanation of this incomprehensible
phrase, was told that on Christmas Night the lying in hospitals
were overcrowded, because then the illegitimate children were
born which had been procreated nine months earlier, on March 22,
the birthday of the old Emperor, celebrated as a popular
holiday.</p>

<p>The increase in wild love, in sexual intercourse dependent upon
the inclination of the moment and upon chance, with a rapid
succession of different individuals&mdash;this increase, which is associated
in the way above described with the sensual life, is a
characteristic of our own time.</p>

<p>In addition to prostitution, which we shall treat in a separate
chapter, the so-called &#8220;<b>intimacy</b>&#8221; constitutes the true nucleus
of wild love. When those who support coercive marriage speak
of free love, they do not mean the free love, the higher individual
love, which we have described in the previous chapter, but they
always refer to the latter-day &#8220;intimacy,&#8221; which, in fact, does
involve the most serious dangers, alike from the physical and
from the moral point of view; for, on the one hand, the &#8220;intimacy&#8221;
forms the principal intermediate agent in the wider
diffusion of venereal diseases, and, on the other hand, this new<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
form of sexual relationship has above all introduced the element
of hypocrisy, lying, and mistrust, which poisons love to-day,
separates the sexes continually more each from the other, and
gives rise to that tragic <b>sexual hate</b>, enmity of men on the part
of women, and misogyny on the part of men, which is also
peculiarly characteristic of our own time.</p>

<p>The gradual differentiation of the originally ideal intimacy, to
the wild love of the present day, has been admirably described
and psychologically elucidated by Hellpach in his short work on
&#8220;Love and Amatory Life in the Nineteenth Century.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this admirable characterization of the &#8220;intimacy,&#8221; the fact
is first established, that it is above all and through and through
a product of great towns, and consequently that it is closely
connected with the capitalistic evolution which compels thousands
of young girls to earn their own living, so that from them are
especially recruited the great human class of shop-girls, and all
the allied varieties, so typical of large towns. This is the soil
in which the &#8220;intimacy&#8221; naturally develops. [Hellpach writes
first of conditions of a generation ago, and then passes on thirty
years to our own day.]</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;By day these girls were occupied. When the evening came,
bringing with it the greatly desired closing of the shop, the prospect
opened to them of going home to poor surroundings, often enough of
taking part in painful family scenes, then going to bed, and the next
morning early returning to business. This was their life, day in, day
out. Here was no very pleasant calendar, especially when the way
from the places of business to their home led through streets crowded
with brilliantly lighted beer saloons, cafes, theatres, and concert-halls.
And all this during the years of sexual blossoming, when the
ardent sensual desire for the first time ran through all the nerves!
Who can wonder that the longing became absolutely fiery, after all the
work of the day, to enjoy a little share of all the glories of the great
town which lay extended before their gaze? After the confinement
of the shop, not to return straightway to the confinement of the
family, but to learn to know a little about the freedom of pleasure&mdash;and
this under the most entrancing form of a little love affair?</p>

<p>&#8220;And the social conditions were such as to make it possible for
this yearning to be fulfilled. Were there not thousands of young
shopmen, hundreds of students, clerks, non-commissioned officers,
who would rather walk about in the evening with a girl on their arm
than alone? Prostitutes would be little suited for such companionship.
Besides, it would not be always the young man&#8217;s intention to
proceed to an extremity, to have a night of love following the evening
of amusement; the young man simply was in the mood to walk about
with the girl, to gossip, perhaps to embrace and kiss her a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here was the beginning. The young man accosted a shop-girl,
accompanied her a little way, made an appointment for the following
evening; then he went a little further; he saw how pleased the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
one was; the <i>tutoyer</i> and the kiss followed. So it went on for a few
evenings, and the young man felt that the happy girl was quite as
eager as he himself was to take the last step; and when this was done,
there was the &#8220;intimacy&#8221; complete. And in all respects it appeared
preferable to prostitution; it was inexpensive, unassuming, very
pleasant, and&mdash;involved no risk to health. Moreover, to both this
amatory life did not seem a &#8216;necessary evil&#8217; on the contrary, it was
a glorious pleasure, and there were only two little shadows in the
bright picture: the fear of having a child, and the thought of separation.
Moreover, this cloud troubled the man only; girls then, as
to-day, thought very little about matters so remote.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the development of the &#8216;intimacy&#8217; during the last thirty years,
many details have undergone change, but the picture as a whole has
been but little affected. The young shop-girl of to-day does not need
a long courting; she enters her business already fully aware that
she will soon be &#8216;intimate&#8217; with some one. At first she will always
prefer to choose a man of whom it is possible to assume that he may
marry her. A young shopman, a non-commissioned officer, will,
therefore, be most in demand. It is not till later, when resignation
comes, and the only remaining wish is for amusement, that University
students have the preference; they are jollier, more entertaining,
and the girl is vain about their position. That has all remained just
as it used to be; only thirty years ago there were many shop-girls
who, notwithstanding all their desire, remained untouched. For the
girl brought up in the atmosphere of the lower middle classes there
was a certain ill-odour about free sexual intercourse. <b>This has completely
passed away.</b> The girls of this stratum, who, with open eyes,
withstand all allurements, might be counted on the fingers. At the
present day, these &#8216;intimacies&#8217; extend deeply into the middle classes
of society.</p>

<p>&#8220;As regards the men, there has certainly been one marked change.
The illusion that sexual intercourse with an &#8216;intimate&#8217; offered any
guarantee against the danger of venereal disease has now long been
dispelled. We are to-day confronted with the fact that the intimacy
is the focus of venereal infection to a far greater
<span class="nowrap">extent<a id="FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span> than is actual
prostitution. In order to understand this, we must glance at the
dissolution of the intimacy.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We have already pointed out that in the German &#8216;intimacy&#8217;
there has never occurred a thorough development of a life like that of
the Parisian &#8216;grisette&#8217;; and there will be no change in this respect
within a time which we can at present foresee. Even in Berlin there
are not many dwellings in which the landlord would tolerate the visits
of ladies of doubtful reputation on any account whatever. But even
those who let quarters on easy terms, or, as the student calls them,
&#8216;storm-free&#8217; rooms, would never allow their lodger to entertain a
woman day after day, and could not do so without running the risk
of being suspected by the police of procurement. Thus, the only thing
that unites the two parties in the intimacy is in almost all cases sexual
intercourse. The characteristic of grisette-love, the prose of the life
in common, day after day, is hardly ever experienced in the &#8216;intimacy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>&#8217;
<b>In consequence of this, on the man&#8217;s side satiety very readily ensues.</b>
New impressions enchain and stimulate him. He breaks off the
intimacy, and this is not usually done with tenderness. The possibilities
are numerous, but the only decent way, the open verbal communication
of the fact, is probably the rarest. He breaks off the
intimacy without a word, and as far as he is concerned the matter is
at an end; he is richer by an agreeable experience, and after a while
begins to look round once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl also. But for her, this dissolution of the intimacy is
very often the first step upon a very steep downward path. At first
there perhaps ensues a short period of bitterness, but the sexual impulse
makes light of all other activities; a new intimacy begins. And
now, gradually, the idea gains ground in her mind that a change in
love is, after all, not such a bad thing. The second breach is borne with
equanimity; <b>and very soon it is by no means rare for the girl to limit
her love associations to a few days, and ultimately, as a matter of
daily custom, to seek fresh gratification with a new associate</b>. It
is not yet professional prostitution; psychologically also there is
still a difference. There is still sensual perception at the root of her
actions, and of such a strength, increasing owing to excess in sexual
intercourse, that the personality of the partner in the sexual act becomes
almost a matter of indifference. But now an economic difficulty
commonly intervenes: discharge from her position, expulsion from her
parents&#8217; house, either or both being due to her dissipated life, with its
heedlessness and the resulting dislike to hard work&mdash;and then the
avalanche falls. Hunger drives her to do that for payment which
hitherto she has done only for the gratification of her own desires.
Prostitution has one victim the more.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the whole period between the beginning of the second intimacy
and her enrolment in the list of prostitutes by the police offers to all
her lovers the greatest possible danger of venereal infection. <b>For
the majority of girls actually become infected in their very first intimacy.</b>
The explanation of this goes back to the time in which the
intimacy first began to become fashionable, and in which the control
of prostitutes with regard to their condition of health was even more
defective, and the safeguarding against the danger of venereal infection
was even less understood than at the present day. In the
majority of cases the young men of the large towns were infected in
their very first experience of love; for it was with prostitutes that they
always sought their first sexual gratification, as is still customary at
the present day. For the inexperienced youth this course is easier,
making, as it does, fewer demands on his adroitness, and none at all
on his seductive skill; whereas in the formation of an &#8216;intimacy&#8217;
these qualities are somewhat in demand. Later, when he had had
enough of prostitution, he sought an &#8216;intimate,&#8217; and since at that
time the treatment of gonorrh&#339;a was still extremely defective, he
promptly infected his partner in the intimacy. <b>In this manner the
girls engaged in intimacies, since they first became fashionable, have
been systematically infected.</b>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Next to <b>prostitution</b>, the <b>intimacy</b> is the great focus of sexual
infection; and wild love, from the psychological and ethical<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
points of view, involves the same danger as prostitution. The
frequent changes, the multiplicity of sexual intercourse in intimacies,
allows no deeper spiritual relationships to be formed;
thus, the girls are debased to become the simple objects of
physical sensuality, and they are forced more and more to depend
on the financially stronger men; thus, they rapidly become
partial or complete prostitutes. To them now the sensual life,
the pursuit of pleasure, is the principal thing, not love. Venereal
infection is soon superadded, to deprave them more thoroughly.
Still worse is the corruption of the world of men, who transfer to
the intimacy the practices they have learned in their association
with prostitutes; but, above all, they come finally to seek and
to desire the rude sexual act solely for its own sake, without
feeling the need for any deeper spiritual association. Hence
results the fugitive character of these sexual relationships, the
frequent changes on both sides, and the end&mdash;<b>lies, mistrust,
hatred</b>.</p>

<p>Belief in and hope for true love disappear for ever; there
remains only the cold, desolate, unspeakably embittered disillusionment,
the <b>distrust</b> of the other sex which is so characteristic
of our time. Never before were there so many woman-haters
and man-haters on principle. In the intercourse between
the sexes, neither believes the other any longer; and on both
sides the &#8220;intimacy&#8221; is entered on without any illusions, the
sole aim of both parties being to satisfy in the intensest possible
way their desire for enjoyment and their sensual lusts.</p>

<p>Prostitution can destroy no illusions, for its true character is
manifest at the first glance; but the modern intimacy has become
the grave of love, and has given rise to a new corruption of the
sexual life, which appears almost more dangerous than the old
corruption dependent on prostitution. It has, moreover, become
a second, and not less dangerous, focus of venereal infection, to
the diffusion of which it is extraordinarily favourable.</p>

<p>He, therefore, who wishes to take part in the fight against the
moral degeneration of our amatory life, and to assist in the campaign
against venereal diseases, <b>must attack and endeavour to
suppress the modern development of the life of &#8220;intimacy&#8221; just
as energetically as he attacks prostitution</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>wild love</b> of the present day, &#8220;extra-conjugal&#8221; sexual
intercourse (which, as I cannot too often repeat, has nothing
whatever to do with &#8220;free love&#8221;), and <b>coercive marriage</b>, are
the true causes of sexual corruption. They are intimately associated
one with the other. The social, economic, and spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
civilization of the present day demands free love, with which
neither coercive marriage nor wild love is compatible.</p>

<p>Neither for prostitution, nor for the wild extra-conjugal sexual
intercourse of our time, can any justification be found from the
point of view of medicine, racial hygiene, or sociology. In their
nature both lead to the same end: the death and destruction of
all individual love, of all the finer activities of love, by which the
spiritual nature of man is so greatly enriched; and they both
give rise to a continuous increase and rapid diffusion of venereal
diseases.</p>

<p>The salvation of our people is not to be found in the &#8220;recommendation&#8221;
of extra-conjugal sexual intercourse for all those
who are not in a position to marry&mdash;and the number of these
grows from day to day&mdash;but it is to be found in the <b>reform of
marriage</b>, in a <b>freer</b> configuration of the amatory life, in connexion
with which we can confidently trust Ibsen&#8217;s saying in the
&#8220;Lady from the Sea&#8221;:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get away from this&mdash;that a voluntary promise is to the
full as binding as a marriage.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>There shall not and must not be &#8220;<b>sexual</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>freedom</b>,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor242"></a><a href="#Footnote242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> but there
must be &#8220;freedom of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>When anyone asks me whether I should advise him to indulge
in &#8220;extra-conjugal sexual intercourse,&#8221; as a physician and a
man of science I am compelled to answer with a bald &#8220;No,&#8221;
because I cannot undertake the responsibility of the consequences
of such advice.</p>

<p>Fortunately, alike in the world of women and in the world of
men, there manifests itself an increasing disapproval of wild love
as it exhibits itself in the modern &#8220;intimacies.&#8221; There are
already numerous intimacies which closely resemble free love,
and in which all the conditions of free love are fulfilled, in respect
of duration, of a profound spiritual relationship, a sense of sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span>
responsibility alike physical and moral, and in the joyful
acceptance of the consequences in respect of offspring.</p>

<p>We must, however, continually keep up the fight against wild
love as the enduring associate of prostitution, to which it constitutes
the bridge or stage of transition. Therein lies its greatest
danger. This we shall recognize more clearly in the ensuing
chapter, in which we turn to consider the subject of <b>prostitution</b>.</p>

In the titular heading to this chapter, throughout the chapter, and in most
cases throughout the book, the German word <i>Verf&uuml;hrung</i> has been translated as
<i>seduction</i>. <i>Verf&uuml;hrung</i> means &#8220;leading astray,&#8221; and one of the commonest
uses of the term is to denote <i>sexual</i> leading astray&mdash;the <i>seduction</i> of a woman by
a man. But in some cases <i>Verf&uuml;hrung</i>, like the English <i>seduction</i>, is used in its
more primitive and wider signification. The context will suffice to show the
sense in which the word is employed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

Thus, at the present day, in quite small country towns, we find variety
theatres and low music-halls; and with these, prostitutes are commonly introduced
into the town, so that the wild love, which was previously free from danger,
now becomes a focus of venereal infection.</p>

It has been established by Bonhoeffer, Hoppe, A. H. H&uuml;bner, and others,
that chronic alcoholism constitutes an important cause of prostitution in the case
of the so-called &#8220;late prostitutes&#8221;&mdash;that is to say, in those women who do not
commence a life of professional prostitution at puberty, but usually after the age
of twenty-five years. <i>Cf.</i> Artur Hermann H&uuml;bner, &#8220;Prostitutes in Relation to

At the great public dinner which, in 1890, the town of Berlin gave in the
Rathaus to the members of the International Medical Congress, and at which
4,000 persons consumed 15,382 bottles of wine, 22 hectolitres (484 gallons) of
beer, and 300 bottles of brandy, there were witnessed in and outside the Rathaus
the most disgusting scenes of drunkenness. &#8220;As the blowflies gather round a piece
of carrion, so in the street in front of the Rathaus there had gathered a swarm
of prostitutes, who found a rich booty among the drunken, staggering guests&#8221;
(<i>cf.</i> Rosenfeld, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 325).&mdash;A striking example of the manner in which alcohol
sometimes completely annihilates every &aelig;sthetic perception is reported by
E. Kraepelin (&#8220;The Psychiatric Duties of the State,&#8221; p. 6; Jena, 1900): &#8220;A
number of students were infected by a prostitute, who from early youth had been
weak-minded, and who was suffering from both lupus of the nose and recent
syphilis.&#8221;</p>

<p><a id="Footnote241"></a><a href="#FNanchor241"><span class="label">[241]</span></a>
It is not yet quite so bad as this. But the number of venereal infections
that occur in consequence of wild love, and of free sexual intercourse in these
relations of &#8220;intimacy,&#8221; is continually on the increase.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote242"></a><a href="#FNanchor242"><span class="label">[242]</span></a>
Sexual freedom&mdash;that is to say, the formal organization of sexual promiscuity&mdash;was
demanded by a certain Dr. Roderich Hellmann in a book which has
now become very rare, because it was confiscated immediately after publication.
Its title was &#8220;Sexual Freedom: a Philosophic Attempt to Increase Human
Happiness&#8221; (Berlin, 1878). The author demands that immediately after
puberty &#8220;the sexual organs shall have the opportunity of a regulated activity,&#8221;
and that it shall now be allowed to persons of both sexes &#8220;to indulge in sexual
intercourse as much as they please,&#8221; of course, with the avoidance of injury to
health and of pregnancy. This remarkable freak proceeds to demand that
public lavatories shall be done away with, so that persons of both sexes shall
relieve themselves freely in one another&#8217;s presence in the open street, and, with
equal freedom, shall display their sexual organs to one another for the purpose of
sexual allurement!!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class="noindent"><b>Prostitution</b>, and the <b>venereal diseases</b> so intimately connected
with it, constitute, properly speaking, the <b>nucleus</b>, the <b>central
problem</b>, of the sexual question. The abolition of prostitution
and the suppression of venereal diseases would be almost tantamount
to the solution of the entire sexual problem. Imagine the
extension and the intension of the idea: No prostitution, no more
venereal disease!</p>

<p>There is, in fact, no more gratifying notion, no more illuminating
ideal, than that of moral and physical purity in the relations
between the sexes. At a time in which, especially in social
spheres, such abundant activity and such far-seeing ideas of
reform are apparent, this notion of a campaign against prostitution
and venereal diseases, in the hope of eradicating both evils,
should stand in the forefront of all the demands of civilization,
in order that finally the tragical influence, the poisonous sting,
should be removed from the disordered, unhappy, amatory life
of the present day, and herewith, unquestionably, a proper
<b>foundation</b> should be laid for a more beautiful future for that
life. This idea is unique; it is the greatest of all that man, at
length become <span class="nowrap">self-conscious,<a id="FNanchor243"></a><a href="#Footnote243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span>
has ever grasped; and to this idea
belongs the future!</p>

<p>The French term prostitution and venereal diseases <i>une plaie
sociale</i>, a rodent ulcer in the body of society. I take this apt
comparison, and carry it a stage further, to show a clear picture
of the way along which we must go in order to eradicate prostitution;
for in this respect I am a confirmed optimist. I <b>believe</b>
in the possibility of the eradication of venereal diseases, and of
the abolition of prostitution within the civilized world by national
and international measures. I do not join in the chorus of those
who say, &#8220;because prostitution has always existed, it must always
exist in the future; because venereal diseases have
<span class="nowrap">always<a id="FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
existed, they are unavoidable accompaniments of civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span></p>

<p><b>How long is it</b>, then, since any attempt has been made to oppose
prostitution and venereal diseases? As regards the latter, it is
only within the <b>last few years</b> that we have begun, in the battle
against them, to make systematic use of the results of scientific
research; and the study of prostitution, and the measures based
on that study for its control and prevention, do not date further
back than the second half of the eighteenth century. In fact,
for practical purposes, they date from the appearance of the
classical and epoch-making work of Parent-Duchatelet (1836).</p>

<p>We are, indeed, <b>in the very first stages</b> of the campaign against
prostitution and venereal diseases. All that has hitherto been
done has been to make inadequate, isolated attempts to introduce
unsuitable and half-considered regulations, based upon successive
misconceptions, which have only made matters worse. <b>To-day</b>
medicine, social science, pedagogy, jurisprudence, and ethics have
combined in a <b>common</b> campaign; and this is not national merely,
but unites all civilized nations in a common cause.</p>

<p>Here we find an actual prospect, a credible hope, of a radical
cure of the <i>plaie sociale</i>. But such an ulcer can only be
radically cured when we are not content merely with the <b>local</b>
treatment of the existing sore; we must simultaneously attack the
<b>internal</b> causes of this chronic disease, and in the case with which
we have to do the internal causes are even more important than
the external&mdash;that is to say, <b>ethics</b>, <b>pedagogy</b>, and <b>social science</b>
are even more important and indispensable in the campaign
against prostitution than <b>medicine</b> and <b>hygiene</b>. We shall never
attain our goal by considering and fighting prostitution and
venereal diseases, the consequences of prostitution, purely from
the medical and hygienic standpoint. In this case, one-sidedness
will prove tantamount to failure. The problem of prostitution
must be approached from many sides, because the causes that
have to be considered are <b>manifold</b>, alike anthropological,
economic, social, and psychological, in their nature. There are
<b>many varieties</b> of prostitution; in the same way there are
numerous and various <b>types</b> of prostitutes. It is, therefore, impossible
for one who is acquainted with actual life to hold fast
in a one-sided manner to a single theory. Thus, in one and the
same case the most various points of view have to be considered.</p>

<p>The <b>history</b> of prostitution is an extremely interesting chapter
of the general history of civilization, which has <b>not hitherto</b> been
written in a manner satisfying scientific and critical demands;
but the <b>literature</b> of prostitution is already alarmingly comprehensive.
Here, also, critical grasp and mode of presentation are<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
still entirely wanting. It is impossible, in this place, in which
we speak only of the present-day conditions, to enter at any
length into the historical and literary aspects of the question of
prostitution. This I must leave for a later, comprehensive work,
for which I have for several years been collecting the materials.
Here I shall only briefly refer, for the sake of the reader interested
in the matter, to the most important writings on the subject of
prostitution which have any scientific and historical importance.</p>

<p>Prostitution in antiquity is treated in a masterly manner by
Julius Rosenbaum in his celebrated &#8220;History of Syphilis in
Antiquity&#8221; (Halle, 1839); this is, down to the present day, the
chief source of our knowledge of the conditions in antiquity. It
is true that he starts from the false assumption that syphilis
already existed in ancient times, a view which in the second
volume of my book on the &#8220;Origin of Syphilis&#8221; (now in course
of preparation) I show to be incorrect; this work will also contain
a thorough study of prostitution among the ancients, based upon
the more recent researches published since the year 1839, when
Rosenbaum&#8217;s book appeared.</p>

<p>The first truly classical descriptions of the nature of modern
prostitution dated from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;
these are not scientific, belonging rather to the province of belles-lettres;
but they are of great value in respect of the accuracy of
their observations, and of their psychological insight into the
nature of prostitution. I refer above all to the celebrated
&#8220;Ragionamenti&#8221; of Pietro
<span class="nowrap">Aretino;<a id="FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
next, to the not less important
work, published earlier, in 1528, &#8220;Lozana Andaluza,&#8221;
by Francisco Delgado
(Francesco <span class="nowrap">Delicado).<a id="FNanchor246"></a><a href="#Footnote246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
Both these books,
and also the celebrated &#8220;Zafetta&#8221; of Lorenzo Veniero (<i>circa</i>
1535), describe the conditions of prostitution at the time of the
Italian renascence; these display a most astonishing similarity
to the conditions of the present day, and the books mentioned
have therefore still an instructive
<span class="nowrap">value.<a id="FNanchor247"></a><a href="#Footnote247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>From the seventeenth century we have as important documents
of civilization the description of prostitution in Holland in
the interesting work &#8220;Le Putanisme d&#8217;Amsterdam&#8221; (Brussels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span>
1883; the original Dutch edition, Amsterdam, 1681), and also in
the work published in the same year, 1681, &#8220;Disputatio Medica
qua Lupanaria ex Principiis quoque Medicis Improbantur,&#8221; by
Georg Franck von <span class="nowrap">Franckenau,<a id="FNanchor248"></a><a href="#Footnote248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
noteworthy as being the first
medical polemic against brothels.</p>

<p>Down to the middle of the nineteenth century the study of
prostitution was most active in
<span class="nowrap">France.<a id="FNanchor249"></a><a href="#Footnote249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span> In the second half of
the eighteenth century, according to the expression of the de
Goncourts, &#8220;pornognomonie&#8221; was a scientific problem. Various
attempts at reform were made; as early as 1763 &#8220;<b>moral control</b>&#8221;
was recommended; and in 1769 there appeared the celebrated
&#8220;Pornographe&#8221; of R&eacute;tif de la
<span class="nowrap">Bretonne,<a id="FNanchor250"></a><a href="#Footnote250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span> the first extensive
work on the <b>state regulation</b> of prostitution, the great historical
importance of which was recognized by Mireur, the well-known
syphilologist of Marseilles, by the publication of a new edition
(Brussels, 1879).</p>

<p>But it was with the publication of the immortal and most
admirable work of <span class="nowrap">Parent-Duchatelet,<a id="FNanchor251"></a><a href="#Footnote251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
on prostitution in Paris,
that in the year 1836 the modern <b>scientific</b> literature of prostitution
really began. It is the first work in which full justice is
done to the importance of prostitution in <b>all</b> its relations, and it
is based upon exact medical observations and psychological and
social studies. Even to-day it remains unique in its kind, and
a standing example of critical research and of French learned zeal.</p>

<p>A very short account of the contents of this epoch-making book
of Parent-Duchatelet will best teach us its importance, and will
give us an insight into all the problems connected with prostitution,
and considered by the French author.</p>

<p>In the introduction, Parent-Duchatelet explains the reasons
which led him to undertake the work, and the literary sources he
has consulted. The first chapter then proceeds to the consideration
of certain general problems, gives a <b>definition</b> of the term
prostitute, an estimate of the <b>number</b> of prostitutes in Paris,
their <b>origin</b> in respect of native country, position, culture, profession,
their <b>age</b>, and the <b>first cause of their adoption of this
profession</b>. The second chapter discusses the <b>manners and
customs</b> of prostitutes, the opinion they have of themselves, their
religious ideas, their sense of shame, their spiritual qualities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
tattooing, occupation, uncleanliness, speech, defects and good
qualities, the various classes of prostitutes, and, finally, the
<i>souteneurs</i>. The third chapter contains <b>physiological observations</b>
concerning prostitutes&mdash;namely, concerning their obesity, the
changes in their voice, peculiarities in the colour of the hair and
the eyes, the stature, the condition of the genital organs, and
fertility. In the fourth chapter he deals with the <b>influence of
professional prostitution on the health of the girls</b>, and describes
the various morbid conditions which may result from their
occupation. The fifth chapter treats of the public <b>houses of
prostitution</b> (brothels), their advantages and disadvantages, the
question of brothel streets, and the localization of prostitution
in definite quarters of the town. In the sixth chapter the <b>inscription
of prostitutes in police lists</b> is discussed; in the seventh
<b>procurement and the owners of brothels</b>. Chapters eight, nine, and
ten deal with <b>secret prostitution</b> in houses of accommodation,
drinking-saloons, coffee-houses, tobacconists&#8217; shops, etc.; chapter
eleven discusses <b>street prostitution</b>; chapter twelve, the <b>diffusion
of prostitution</b> in the various parts of Paris; chapter thirteen, the
<b>relation of prostitution to military life</b>; chapter fourteen, <b>prostitution
in the environs of Paris</b>. The fifteenth chapter describes the
<b>ultimate destiny</b> of prostitutes; the sixteenth deals with their
<b>medical treatment</b>&mdash;above all, the methods of examination to
ascertain their state of health are accurately described. Chapters
seventeen and eighteen deal with <b>hospitals</b> and <b>prisons</b> for prostitutes;
chapter nineteen, with the former taxation of prostitutes;
chapter twenty considers <b>questions relating to administration,
and the special branch of police dealing with the institution</b>&mdash;for
example, the suggestion (recently revived) is discussed of the
medical examination of the male clients of prostitutes; prurient
pictures and books are also considered, and thefts in brothels.
The twenty-first chapter is devoted to the question which still
attracts attention at the present day, viz., the <b>peculiar relationship
between the owner of a house and the prostitutes living there</b>,
and deals also with the legal aspect of the punishments decreed
against prostitutes. Chapter twenty-two is occupied with a
general discussion of the <b>legal questions</b> connected with prostitution.
At the conclusion, in chapters twenty-three and twenty-four,
the author discusses the question <b>whether prostitutes are
necessary</b>, and this question (<i>nota bene</i>, from the standpoint of
coercive marriage morality) he answers in the affirmative; he
asks also <b>whether the police should be entrusted with the application
of measures for the prevention of venereal diseases</b>, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span>
he agrees to conditionally only, for he considers that the <b>public</b>
recommendation of protective measures should be forbidden by
police ordinance. Finally, in the last chapter, the twenty-fifth,
he speaks of the <b>institutions for the rescue of fallen women</b>, and
he concludes his comprehensive work, in which he has dealt so
thoroughly with all the subdivisions of his general topic, with the
words:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;My work is at an end. When I commenced it, I pointed out what
reasons I had for undertaking it, what aim I wished to attain. Had I
not been firmly convinced that the investigations begun by me
regarding the nature of prostitutes might favour health and morality, I
should not have published them. I have exposed to the public gaze
great infirmities of mankind; thoughtful men, for whom I have
written, will thank me for doing so. He who loves his fellow-men will
without anxiety follow me into the department of knowledge I have
described, and will not turn away his glance from the pictures I have
drawn. <b>He who wishes to know the good that remains to be done, and
who wishes to learn how to pursue with good results the way by which
something better is to be attained, must first know what actually exists;
he must know the truth.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;The profession of prostitution is an evil of all times, all countries,
and appears to be innate in the social structure of mankind. It will
perhaps never be entirely eradicated; still, all the more we must strive
to limit its extent and its dangers. With prostitution itself it is as with
vice, crime, and disease; the teacher of morals endeavours to prevent
the vices, the lawgiver to prevent the crimes, the physician to cure the
diseases. All alike know that they will never fully attain their goal;
but they pursue their work none the less in the conviction that he who
does only a little good yet does a great service to the weak man. I
follow their example. A friend whose loss I shall always mourn drew
my attention to the fate of the prostitute. I studied them, I wished to
learn the causes of their degradation, and wherever possible to discover
the means by which their number could be limited. What experience
has taught me on this subject I have openly stated, and I am convinced
that the lawgiver, the man whom the State has empowered with
authority to care for public health and morality, will find in my book
useful information.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Parent-Duchatelet&#8217;s book, no less admirable in its execution
than in its design, still remains the foundation for the scientific
study of prostitution. It is the exemplar for all contemporary
and subsequent works.</p>

<p>The powerful influence exercised by this book was shown above
all in this&mdash;that works on prostitution appeared in rapid succession
in the various capitals of the civilized world. These were all
based to a greater or less extent upon the work of Parent-Duchatelet,
and thus they constitute extremely valuable scientific monographs
regarding the conditions of prostitution in particular towns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span>
such as since that date have not been issued. Here there still lies
hidden a wealth of material, a large part of which has not yet
been utilized.</p>

<p>As an enlargement and continuation of the work of Parent-Duchatelet,
there appeared three years later, in the year 1839,
the work of the Commissary of Police
<span class="nowrap">B&eacute;raud<a id="FNanchor252"></a><a href="#Footnote252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span> on the prostitutes
of Paris and on the Parisian <i>police des m&#339;urs</i>. The book is more
especially distinguished by an elaborate history of prostitution,
and by the wealth of psychological observations it contains; also
by its exact information regarding secret prostitution.</p>

<p>In the same year a well-known London physician, Dr. Michael
<span class="nowrap">Ryan,<a id="FNanchor253"></a><a href="#Footnote253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>
published his important book on <b>Prostitution in</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>London</b>,<a id="FNanchor254"></a><a href="#Footnote254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>
with a comparison of the conditions in Paris and New York.
Ryan first dealt with the general <b>social</b> and <b>economic</b> causes of
prostitution, with critical acumen, as we could not but expect
from an Englishman. His book also contained an interesting
account of the extraordinary diffusion in England at that time
of pornographic books and <span class="nowrap">pictures,<a id="FNanchor255"></a><a href="#Footnote255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>
and concerning their publication
and sale by pedlars, and the measures undertaken to
repress this traffic. Valuable also are the detailed reports given
in this book, on pp. 212-252, regarding prostitution in the United
States, and especially in New York.</p>

<p>The example of Ryan was followed by his countrymen, Dr.
William Tait and the Rev. Ralph Wardlaw. The former treated
in a comprehensive work the subject of prostitution in
<span class="nowrap">Edinburgh;<a id="FNanchor256"></a><a href="#Footnote256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span>
the latter, in a shorter book, described prostitution in
<span class="nowrap">Glasgow.<a id="FNanchor257"></a><a href="#Footnote257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Very interesting is the book, of which a few copies only ever
reached Germany (one of which is in my own possession), and
which even in Portugal is extremely rare, of Dr. Francisco Ignacio
dos Santos Cruz regarding prostitution in
<span class="nowrap">Lisbon,<a id="FNanchor258"></a><a href="#Footnote258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span> in which the
whole subject of Portuguese prostitution is admirably described,
with special reference to the capital city. Santos Cruz gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span>
most careful attention to the legislative aspect of the question.
He was the first to advocate a measure which has recently been
proposed also by Lesser (doubtless in ignorance of the work of
his predecessor)&mdash;viz., the <b>formation of polyclinics for the gratuitous
treatment of</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>prostitutes</b>.<a id="FNanchor259"></a><a href="#Footnote259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Regarding prostitution in the town of Lyons, renowned for its
immorality, Dr. Potton wrote a celebrated book, which received
a prize from the Medical Society of Lyons in the year 1841. This
work was based on official sources, and had especial reference to
the relationships of prostitution to the hygienic and economic
conditions of the <span class="nowrap">population.<a id="FNanchor260"></a><a href="#Footnote260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>A valuable book, also, is the work on prostitution in Algiers
by E. A. <span class="nowrap">Duchesne.<a id="FNanchor261"></a><a href="#Footnote261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
It contains an elaborate account of
&#8220;<b>male prostitution</b>&#8221;&mdash;that is, prostitution of men for men&mdash;an
expansion of the idea of prostitution which is, as far as my
knowledge goes, found here for the first time. Naturally,
in earlier works we find allusions to men who practise pederasty
for money, but the idea &#8220;prostitution&#8221; had hitherto been
strictly limited to the class of purchasable women.</p>

<p>We see this, for example, in the anonymous book &#8220;<b>Prostitution
in Berlin, and its</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>Victims</b>,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor262"></a><a href="#Footnote262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
published in Berlin seven years
before the appearance of the work of Duchesne. The author
definitely states that &#8220;the admirable book of Parent-Duchatelet
on prostitution in the town of Paris, and its remarkable success,
have chiefly given occasion to the publication of my own work.&#8221;
The book is, however, quite independent in character, and treats
of the individual relationships of prostitution in Berlin, on the
basis of <b>official</b> sources and experience, in historical, moral,
medical, and political relations, and also from the point of view
of police administration. It contains an appendix on &#8220;<b>prostituted
men</b>&#8221; (p. 207), who, however, are not homosexual prostitutes,
but, according to the writer&#8217;s own definition, &#8220;men who
make it their profession to serve for payment <b>voluptuous women</b>
by the gratification of the latter&#8217;s unnatural passions.&#8221; This
species still exists at the present day, but there is no particular
name for the type. (In the seventies, in Vienna, men who could
be hired to perform coitus were known locally as &#8220;stallions&#8221;&mdash;Ger.
<b>Hengste</b>.) We must include them in the great army of<span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span>
<i>souteneurs</i>, although the term is not strictly applicable. Later
we shall return to the consideration of this peculiar variety of
male prostitution.</p>

<p>As an enlargement of the work just mentioned, we can regard
the book published in the same year, 1846, by the Criminal Commissary,
Dr. Carl R&ouml;hrmann, on <b>Prostitution in</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>Berlin</b>.<a id="FNanchor263"></a><a href="#Footnote263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>This book is especially remarkable from the fact that it contains
&#8220;complete and candid biographies of the best-known prostitutes
in Berlin,&#8221; an idea which has recently been revived, for example,
in W. Hammer&#8217;s &#8220;The Life-History of Ten Public Prostitutes in
Berlin&#8221; (Berlin and Leipzig, 1905).</p>

<p>Very valuable official material is, finally, to be found in a third
work on prostitution in Berlin, written by the celebrated syphilologist
F. J. <span class="nowrap">Behrend.<a id="FNanchor264"></a><a href="#Footnote264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>
It begins with a careful history of the
police regulations regarding prostitution in Berlin, then discusses
the consequences of the abolition of the Berlin brothels in the
year 1845, and proceeds to demand new measures and regulations
for the control of prostitution and for the prevention of syphilis
in Berlin. As a collection of material, the book is of considerable
value.</p>

<p>Little known, but thoroughly original, is the work of the
Hamburg physician, Dr. Lippert, on <b>prostitution in</b>

Blaschko even fails to mention it in the bibliography at the end
of his own work, presently to be described. Lippert adduces
numerous and interesting new contributions to our knowledge
of &#8220;the many-headed hydra, the colour-changing chameleon,&#8221;
of prostitution. After an introductory sketch regarding the historical
development of prostitution in Hamburg, he gives a
&#8220;characterization of the present moral condition of Hamburg,&#8221;
embodying important information regarding the number of
brothel prostitutes and street-walkers, the topographical distribution
of prostitution and of brothels, the secret houses of accommodation,
the remarkable decline in the number of marriages,
the relationship between legitimate and illegitimate births, and
the number of drinking-saloons and dancing-halls; and he goes
on to describe with more detail these individual factors of prostitution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
and especially the opportunities for prostitution. The third
chapter contains an extremely interesting physiological and pathological
description of the Hamburg prostitutes. According to
Lippert, the principal motives of prostitution are &#8220;<b>idleness</b>,
<b>frivolity</b>, and, above all, the <b>love of finery</b>.&#8221; He rightly lays
especial stress upon the last-named cause, which, in the more
recent scientific investigations regarding the causes of prostitution,
has, unfortunately, been too much neglected. Then follow
data regarding the age, nationality, class, and occupation of
prostitutes. We learn that as early as the date of this book of
Lippert&#8217;s the greatest number of public prostitutes had originally
been <b>maidservants</b> (p. 79), not girls of the labouring classes. Thus
the fact that prostitutes recruit their ranks chiefly from the
servant class is not, as recent writers assert, exclusively the
consequence of the increasing mental culture of the modern
proletariat, but is most probably rather connected with the freer
configuration of the amatory life among the labouring classes,
where the nobler form of &#8220;free love&#8221; has long been dominant.
From the very nature of the case, this must lead to a limitation
of the supply of prostitutes from this class. The chapter closes
with an elaborate description of the physical and mental peculiarities
of the Hamburg prostitutes, and of the diseases observed
in them. In the fourth chapter the various classes of prostitutes
are considered more closely&mdash;the brothel prostitutes (with an
exact description of the celebrated brothel streets of Hamburg),
the prostitutes living alone, the street-walkers, the &#8220;kept
women,&#8221; the large group of secret prostitutes. There follow in
an appendix interesting accounts of the public places which
are related to prostitution; of prostitution in the Hamburger
Berg and in the suburb of St. Pauli; and of the rescue work of
Hamburg.</p>

<p>A very good account of prostitution in Hamburg is also found
in a book contemporary with that of Lippert, entitled &#8220;<b>Memoirs
of a Prostitute, or Prostitution in Hamburg</b>&#8221; (St. Pauli, 1847).
This work, which is now extraordinarily rare, resembles the book
which recently gained such celebrity, the &#8220;Tagebuch einer Verlorenen&#8221;
(&#8220;Diary of a Lost Woman&#8221;), by Margaret B&ouml;hme, in
that it was edited by a Dr. J. Zeisig, professedly after the &#8220;original
manuscript.&#8221; As usual, it has all happened before!</p>

<p>In the preface to his book, Lippert remarks that, since prostitution
in Berlin and in Hamburg has now been adequately described,
it was desirable that an analogous book should be compiled
regarding Vienna, in order that we might have the necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page316">[316]</span>
comparative statistics of &#8220;the three principal towns and principal
factors of German prostitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>The actual account of prostitution in Vienna did not, however,
appear till forty years later, in the year 1886. Still, as early as
1847 the book of Dr. Anton J. Gross-Hoffinger was published,
describing exclusively the conditions of prostitution in Austria,
and naturally chiefly concerned with conditions in
<span class="nowrap">Vienna.<a id="FNanchor266"></a><a href="#Footnote266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span> In
my opinion, this book has an epoch-making significance, because
therein we find asserted for the first time, with all possible
emphasis, that the institution of <b>coercive marriage</b> is the ultimate
cause of prostitution, to which all the other causes are subsidiary.
In no other book do we find so painful a description, drawn with
such astonishing clearness, of the horrible conditions resulting
from the artificial preservation of the official and ecclesiastical
coercive marriage, which was really based upon economic conditions
peculiar to the remote past. The two first sections,
&#8220;Woman the Slave of Civilization&#8221; and &#8220;Woman in her Degradation,&#8221;
are the most frightful accusations of conventional
marriage. On pp. 190 and 191 the author formulates in fifteen
paragraphs a law of marriage reform, which has a very close
resemblance to the previously described ideas of Ellen Key. A
perfect classic is the chapter on servant-girls (pp. 226-284), unique
in its thoroughness, and affording an admirable description of the
legal, moral, and economic relationships of domestic service.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;<b>The great army of domestic servants</b>,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;<b>constitute the
ever-ready reserve force of prostitution. Daily from this reserve are
drawn new recruits for the regular service, and daily the vacant places
in the reserve are once more filled.</b>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Gross-Hoffinger, in 1847, came also to the conclusion that in
&#8220;free love&#8221; or &#8220;free marriage&#8221; was to be found the only salvation
from the misery of prostitution.</p>

<p>The comprehensive work of Schrank upon prostitution in
<span class="nowrap">Vienna<a id="FNanchor267"></a><a href="#Footnote267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span>
is distinguished by an abundance of interesting isolated
observations, and these are especially to be found in the earlier
historical portion. The second part is occupied with the administration
and hygiene of prostitution in Vienna. The work gives
an exhaustive account of Viennese prostitution down to the
year 1885.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span></p>

<p>Prostitution in Leipzig was described in three chapters of a
general work on prostitution, published in the year
<span class="nowrap">1854.<a id="FNanchor268"></a><a href="#Footnote268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span> The
titles of these three chapters are: &#8220;Moral Corruption in Leipzig&#8221;;
&#8220;Tolerated Prostitutes and Tolerated Houses in Leipzig&#8221;;
&#8220;Tolerated Prostitutes in Leipzig: their Morals, their Customs,
their Hygienic Condition, their End.&#8221; Very interesting is the
statement of the author that of the 3,000 maidservants in Leipzig,
<i>one-third</i> were engaged in secret prostitution.</p>

<p>The prostitution in the largest town of the new world, in
New York, also found an admirable description in the sixth
decade of the nineteenth century in the great historical work of
the New York physician, William M.
<span class="nowrap">Sanger.<a id="FNanchor269"></a><a href="#Footnote269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span> Of the 685
large octavo pages which the book contains, pages 450 to 676 are
devoted to the description of the conditions of prostitution in
New York. The historical portion of the book is also extremely
valuable, being based upon the best historical authorities.</p>

<p>With the year 1860, or thereabouts, this first period of the
scientific literature of prostitution, characterized by monographs
dealing with individual <b>towns</b>, in pursuance of the example of
Parent-Duchatelet, came to a close. Just as Parent-Duchatelet
had inaugurated this kind of description, so the French now
undertook the introduction of the further researches into prostitution.
First of all, Dr. J. Jeannel summarized the results of
the books we have already mentioned in a general work on
<span class="nowrap">prostitution,<a id="FNanchor270"></a><a href="#Footnote270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>
which contained a comparative view of the conditions
in various countries and towns. An Englishman, W. Acton,
also wrote a similar general work on
<span class="nowrap">prostitution;<a id="FNanchor271"></a><a href="#Footnote271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span> whilst yet
another general work on the subject was written by the German
<span class="nowrap">H&uuml;gel.<a id="FNanchor272"></a><a href="#Footnote272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The extremely important question of <b>secret</b> prostitution has
been elucidated especially by the writings of
<span class="nowrap">Martineau<a id="FNanchor273"></a><a href="#Footnote273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span> and
<span class="nowrap">Commenge;<a id="FNanchor274"></a><a href="#Footnote274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span>
the not less important question of prostitution
practised by <b>girls under full age</b> is treated by
<span class="nowrap">Augagneur;<a id="FNanchor275"></a><a href="#Footnote275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span>
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
<b>problems of regulation and of brothels</b> have been studied by
Fiaux, whose work is comprehensive and based upon carefully
compiled statistics, and the author attempts the solution of these
<span class="nowrap">problems;<a id="FNanchor276"></a><a href="#Footnote276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span>
the sometime French Minister Yves Guyot has discussed
the problem of prostitution from the higher philosophical
and social point of <span class="nowrap">view;<a id="FNanchor277"></a><a href="#Footnote277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span>
in short, the French physicians illuminated
this obscure province of thought from every side, and
<b>laid the foundations for the scientific and critical study of prostitution</b>,
which began with the last decade of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>To Alfred Blaschko unquestionably belongs the credit of having
broken entirely new ground in connexion with the problem of
prostitution, by means of the debate instituted by him in the
year 1892 in the Medical Society of Berlin, and by several works
distinguished by a sharp-sighted, critical
<span class="nowrap">faculty.<a id="FNanchor278"></a><a href="#Footnote278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span> Upon his
exhaustive scientific studies, and upon the most careful practical
considerations, Blaschko bases the demands:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;<b>Abolish Regulation!</b><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><b>Away with Brothels!</b>&#8221;<br /></span>
</div>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p class="noindent">At the same time, Blaschko is a convinced advocate of the
economic theory of prostitution.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time, Cesare Lombroso, the celebrated
alienist and criminal anthropologist of Turin, propounded his
<b>anthropological</b> theory of prostitution, and enunciated the
doctrine, which attracted so much attention, of the &#8220;Donna
delinquinte e prostituta,&#8221; of the &#8220;<b>congenital</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>prostitute</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor279"></a><a href="#Footnote279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span> This
doctrine found an unconditional supporter in the St. Petersburg
syphilologist Tarnowsky; whilst the latter strongly opposed the
efforts made by the International Federation, founded in 1875
by Mrs. Josephine Butler, for the abolition of the regulation of
<span class="nowrap">prostitution.<a id="FNanchor280"></a><a href="#Footnote280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span>
Str&ouml;hmberg, in an interesting work on
<span class="nowrap">prostitution,<a id="FNanchor281"></a><a href="#Footnote281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span>
takes the same standpoint as Lombroso and Tarnowsky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span></p>

<p>It is, however, noteworthy that quite recently the French observers
also, and, above all, the experienced Fiaux, are inclining to
the views of Blaschko, of the accuracy of which I myself am now
fully convinced, notwithstanding the fact that in my work on
prostitution in <span class="nowrap">England,<a id="FNanchor282"></a><a href="#Footnote282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span>
which appeared eight years ago (October,
1900), I still advocated regulation. E. von D&uuml;ring also, who, as
professor of medicine in Constantinople for many years, has made
elaborate study of the conditions of prostitution in that town,
adheres, in an essay well worth reading, without qualification to
the opinion of Blaschko regarding the uselessness of regulation
and of <span class="nowrap">brothels.<a id="FNanchor283"></a><a href="#Footnote283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>After this brief enumeration of the most important descriptive
and scientific studies of prostitution, we shall now proceed to a
short account of the conditions that obtain at the present day.</p>

<p>The idea of &#8220;<b>prostitution</b>&#8221; is in no respect clearly and sharply
limited. Parent-Duchatelet considered that prostitution only
occurred</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;when a woman was known to have accepted money for this purpose
on several successive occasions, when she was openly recognized as
being engaged in this occupation, when an arrest had occurred and the
offence had thus been definitely discovered, or when in any other way
it was proved to the satisfaction of the police&#8221; (vol. i., p. 11).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>But in this way he entirely excluded the so-called &#8220;secret&#8221;
prostitution&mdash;that is to say, he excluded by far the largest
category of prostitution.</p>

<p>As soon as we take this latter into consideration, we find it
necessary to have a wider conception of the term &#8220;prostitution.&#8221;
This is recognized by the French physician Rey in his little
book on &#8220;<b>Public and Secret Prostitution</b>&#8221; (German edition, p. 1;
Leipzig, 1851). He regards as prostitution the act &#8220;by which a
woman allows the <b>use of her body by any man, without distinction</b>,
and <b>for a payment made or expected</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this admirable definition we see the two most important
characteristics of prostitution: <b>complete indifference with regard
to the person of the man demanding the use of her body</b>, and
the fact that <b>the act is done for reward</b>. The only point omitted
from consideration is the condition mentioned by Parent-Duchatelet&mdash;namely,
the <b>frequent repetition</b> of the act of prostitution
with <b>different</b> men.</p>

<p>Schrank combines all these characteristics of prostitution in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span>
much briefer phrase, by defining them as &#8220;<b>professional acts of
fornication performed with the human body</b>,&#8221; by which, in the
first place, we include male and female <b>homosexual</b> prostitution,
which are not covered by the definitions previously quoted,
and, in the second place, Schrank&#8217;s definition lays stress on the
fact that in <b>genuine</b> prostitution the <b>monetary reward</b> is the aim
of the act of prostitution much more than any kind of enjoyment.
Where enjoyment plays a prominent part, <b>in addition to</b> the
earning of money, we are no longer concerned with genuine prostitution.
Even a prostitute, who in other respects is typically a
woman of that class, ceases at that moment and for that time
to be a prostitute, when her earnings become a secondary consideration,
and the <b>man</b> to whom she gives herself the principal
consideration.</p>

<p>For this reason, strictly speaking, a large proportion of secret
prostitutes and numerous members of the half-world cannot be
reckoned as prostitutes in the proper sense of the term&mdash;at any
rate, <b>not always</b>; not when, for instance, the man who supports
and pays them is at the same time their
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;lover&#8221;;<a id="FNanchor284"></a><a href="#Footnote284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span> they then
belong for the time being to the not less dangerous province of
&#8220;wild love.&#8221; But in practice this distinction cannot be strictly
maintained, for the <b>same</b> woman will very frequently undertake
a genuine act of prostitution.</p>

<p>It is only the &#8220;sale of the sweet name of love,&#8221; as the celebrated
politician Louis Blanc expresses it, which constitutes prostitution&mdash;the
<b>complete lack</b> of all spiritual and all personal relationships
on the one side, and the ignominious predominance of the
<b>mercantile</b> character of the sexual union on the other. Hence
there may be prostitution in marriage, although this always
remains widely different from the sale of the body to <b>numerous</b>
and <b>frequently changing</b> individuals.</p>

<p>The &#8220;prostitution&#8221; of primeval times, in which social relationships
were so utterly different from ours, unquestionably resembled
rather the wild love of the present day than our own prostitution.
It was sexual promiscuity, not professional fornication. According
to Heinrich Schurtz, prostitution is indeed not an exclusive
product of higher civilization, but occurs also among primitive
peoples, and appears everywhere where the unrestricted sexual
intercourse of youth&mdash;wild love&mdash;is prevented, without early
marriage taking its place. But what he describes as prostitution&mdash;for
example, the living of several unmarried girls in the houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
of men&mdash;is still no more than a peculiar form of wild love. Still,
according to the reports of numerous travellers, there are among
primitive peoples also <b>purchasable</b> women, and this must be
explained, just as in our own case, from the combined influence
of individual, social, and economic conditions.</p>

<p>To my mind there is no doubt that the so-called &#8220;<b>religious</b>&#8221;
prostitution is to be regarded as at least a <b>germinal form</b> and
<b>predecessor</b> of the prostitution of the present day. In this case
also we had to do with <b>professional</b> fornication; only, although
the temple-girls, just like our modern prostitutes, gave themselves
<b>indifferently to any man</b> that offered the money paid for this
service, that money did not, in the case of religious prostitution,
go to the girl herself, but to the deity, or to the crafty priests
who represented him; thus the priests really played the part of
our modern brothel-keepers. It is absolutely unquestionable
that in this religious prostitution a more ideal element also played
a part. This subject was discussed at considerable length above
(<a href="#Page100">pp. 100</a>-<a href="#Page112">112</a>).</p>

<p>Prostitution is everywhere a product of the <b>growth of large
towns</b>; its peculiar characteristics are developed only in large
towns. To the country it was always foreign until those beautiful
times of the middle ages, in which prostitution was regarded as
a <b>necessary of life</b>, like eating and drinking, and was organized
in guilds, so that everywhere &#8220;women-houses&#8221; were instituted
for the public, unconstrained use of all classes, for peasant and
prince. At that time quite small towns also had their brothels.
The appearance of syphilis, and the awakening of modern
individualism, brought these conditions to an end; the brothels
disappeared everywhere; and this tendency to a <b>continuous
decrease</b> of barrack prostitution, to a progressive diminution in
the number of brothels, has continually strengthened. On the
whole, the rural districts to-day do not know prostitution; there
we have only free love and wild love. The existence of prostitution
is confined to the large towns, because in these all the necessary
conditions are fulfilled, and, above all, because in large
towns the possibilities for the gratification of the sexual impulse
by marriage or by free love are in the case of men much more
limited than they are in the country. In the town there is even
a <b>demand</b> for prostitutes, but not in the country. It is true that
the demand on the part of men does not correspond to the extension
which modern prostitution has assumed in the large towns;
this demand corresponds, as it were, to a portion only of prostitution.
In his admirable work on the campaign against prostitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page322">[322]</span>
(<i>Journal for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases</i>, vol. ii.,
pp. 311-313) F. Schiller proves that prostitution has not increased
merely in proportion to the increase in the male population, <b>but
that in reality, in recent decades, it has increased, on the whole,
in a much greater proportion than the population, and that different
towns exhibit the most remarkable contrasts in the respective
ratios of prostitutes to male population</b>.</p>

<p>For example, in Berlin prostitution has increased <b>to an extent
almost double</b> that of the increase in male population. A similar
relationship is to be observed in other large towns. Everywhere
the supply of prostitutes <b>exceeds</b> the demand; and we cannot
doubt that by this great supply the need for prostitutes is to a
large extent at first aroused. Street-walkers and brothels <b>allure</b>
many men to sexual intercourse who otherwise would not have
felt any need for it.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the existence of a <b>voluntary demand</b> for
prostitutes on the part of <b>men</b> is a fact which cannot be denied.
In this sense prostitution has been described as mainly a &#8220;man&#8217;s
question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here we touch upon an extremely difficult problem, and one
which, as far as I can see, no one before myself has definitely
stated, perhaps because no one has <b>ventured</b> to do it&mdash;and yet,
for our knowledge of prostitution, the question is one of great
importance.</p>

<p>What precisely is the &#8220;need of man for prostitution&#8221; of which
Blaschko speaks? Is it merely the sexual impulse? Or is there
any other factor in operation?</p>

<p>Certainly the sexual impulse, simple sensuality, plays a large
part in this male demand for prostitutes; but this does not
explain the fact why married men, and so many men who, if not
married, have yet opportunities for other sexual intercourse,
have recourse to prostitutes; it does not explain the fact, by
which I am myself continually and anew astonished, of the
peculiar attractive force which prostitutes exercise upon cultured
men with delicate &aelig;sthetic and ethical perceptions. Is there any
deeper physiological relationship here involved?</p>

<p>I answer this question unconditionally in the affirmative.</p>

<p>It is not by chance that prostitution is mainly a product of
civilization, that it finds in civilization its proper vital conditions,
whereas in primitive states it cannot properly thrive.</p>

<p>In primitive times, unrestrained by the (just) demands of a
higher civilization, and by the social morality intimately
associated therewith, men could, without fear or regret, satisfy<span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span>
their wild impulses, no less in the sexual sphere than in others;
they could give free play to those peculiar biological instincts
of a sexual nature which lie hidden in every man. Their sexual
&#8220;supra- and sub-consciousness,&#8221; to use the happy phrase which
Chr. von Ehrenfels invented to denote the dualism of modern
sexuality, were still <b>monistic</b>. To-day, however, the primitive
instincts are <b>repressed</b> by the necessities of civilized life, and by
the coercive force of conventional morality; but these instincts
still slumber in every one. Each one of us has also his sexual
sub-consciousness. Sometimes it awakens, demands activity,
free from all restraint, from all coercion, from all convention. In
such moments it seems as if the man were an entirely different
being. Here the &#8220;two souls&#8221; in our breast become a reality.
Is this still the celebrated man of learning, the refined idealist,
the sensitive &aelig;sthetic, the artist who has enriched us with the
most magnificent and the purest works of poetry or of plastic art?
We recognize him no longer, because in such moments something
quite different has awakened to life; <b>another</b> nature stirs within
him and urges him with an elemental force to do things from
which his &#8220;supra-consciousness,&#8221; the consciousness of the
civilized man, would draw back in horror.</p>

<p>Such a delicate sensitive nature, open to the finest spiritual
activities, as that of the Danish poet J. P. Jakobsen, must feel
this contrast in an especially painful manner; it is precisely such
natures&mdash;those in which the extremes we have described appear
most sharply and most clearly&mdash;which afford us proof of the
existence of a double consciousness. The primitive instinct breaks
out, like a monomania&mdash;of which old psychiatric doctrine of
&#8220;monomania&#8221; we are involuntarily reminded when we see how
even men of light and leading, men who in other respects live
only in the highest regions of the spirit, are subjected to the
domination of this purely instinctive sexualism, so that they lead
a &#8220;secret&#8221; inner life, of whose existence the world has no suspicion.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Niels Lyhne&#8221; J. P. Jakobsen has admirably characterized
this double life.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;But when,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;he had served God truly for eleven days, it
often happened that <b>other powers</b> gained the upper hand in him; by
an overwhelming force he was driven to the coarse lust of coarse
enjoyments; he yielded, overcome by the human passion for self-annihilation,
which, while the blood burns as blood only can burn,
demands degradation, perversity, dirt, and foulness, with no less force
than the force which inspires the equally human passion for becoming
greater than one is, and purer.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span></p>

<p>These human instincts can be satisfied only by prostitution.
By the purchasable prostitute this desire, described so aptly
and with so much insight by Jakobsen, can be fully satisfied.
To the origin of the desire we shall return in another connexion.
The common, the rough, the brutal animal in the nature of prostitution,
exercises a formal magical attractive force on large numbers
of men.</p>

<p>Ludwig Pietsch, in his &#8220;Recollections of Sixty Years,&#8221; vol. ii.,
p. 337 (Berlin, 1894), tells of the celebrated cocotte of the Second
French Empire, Cora Pearl, whom he saw in Baden-Baden:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I have never been able to understand how it was that she exercised
so powerful an attraction. In her appearance, her tumid, painted
&#8216;pug-face,&#8217; the secret was certainly not to be found. Perhaps the
influence which she exercised on so many men rested principally in the
quality which the royal friend of the Danish Countess Danner described
to the latter, when explaining to her the reason of the power, to others
quite incomprehensible, which Cora Pearl had exercised on his own
heart. He said: &#8216;<b>She is so gloriously vulgar</b>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This word speaks volumes, and illuminates the peculiar influence
of prostitutes and prostitution upon man in an apt and
powerful <span class="nowrap">way.<a id="FNanchor285"></a><a href="#Footnote285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Admirably, also, has Stefan Grimmen, in his novelette &#8220;Die
Landpartie&#8221; (published in <i>Die Welt am Montag</i>, No. 22, May 28,
1906), described this influence, which in this case was exercised
by two demi-mondaines lying in the grass, upon the masculine
members of a picnic-party, who were so enthralled as completely
to forget the ladies of their company. The de Goncourts were
also aware of the specific allurement exercised by prostitutes, for
in one place in their diary they recommend a wife to adopt
certain customs of prostitutes, in order to bind her husband to
her for a long time.</p>

<p>In this respect, we cannot fail to recognize a certain masochistic
trait in the sensibility of men, which appears especially
remarkable when we call to mind the contrast between the nature
of the above described spiritually lofty persons and the nature of
a prostitute. In this way we should be led to the view that
<b>prostitution is in part a product of the physiological male masochism</b>&mdash;that
is to say, of the impulse from time to time to plunge
into the depths of coarse, brutal, sexual lust and of self-mortification<span class="pagenum" id="Page325">[325]</span>
and self-abasement, by surrender to a comparatively worthless
creature. This attraction towards prostitutes is one of the
most remarkable phenomena in the psyche of the modern civilized
man; it is the curse of the evolution of civilization.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The most ideal man also is unable to free himself from his body,&#8221;
says Heinrich Schurtz; &#8220;refinement leads ultimately to an unnatural
over-nicety, <b>which must necessarily be permeated from time to time by
a breath of fresh unrefinement and coarse naturalism</b>, if it is not to
perish from its own inward contradiction.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In a certain sense the same need finds expression also in
Gutzkow&#8217;s remark in the &#8220;Neue Serapionsbr&uuml;der,&#8221; vol. i., p. 198
(Breslau, 1877), that man sometimes has a need for &#8220;<b>woman-in-herself</b>,&#8221;
not woman with the thousand and one tricks and
whimsies of wives, mothers, and daughters.</p>

<p>Without question, this need is much more characteristic of
man than of woman. Still, I am not prepared altogether to
deny its existence in the latter. In another connexion I shall
return to this extremely important question.</p>

<p>Naturally in this we see no more than a <b>favouring factor</b> of the
appearance of prostitution <b>in the mass</b>; we do not speak of it as
the definite cause of the production of any individual prostitute.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, I consider the dispute regarding the causes
of prostitution as superfluous; a number of causes are in operation,
and in each individual case it is always an unfortunate
<b>concatenation</b> of circumstances, of subjective and objective
influences, which have driven the girl to prostitution. The
various <b>theories</b> regarding the causes of prostitution have therefore
only a relative value. Not one of them explains it wholly;
each explanation demands the assistance of others.</p>

<p>This is, above all, true of the celebrated theory of Lombroso,
regarding the &#8220;<b>born prostitute</b>,&#8221; a theory which states, to put
the matter shortly and clearly, that the girl is born with all the
<b>rudimentary characteristics</b> of a prostitute, and that these rudimentary
characteristics have also a <b>physical</b> foundation, in the
form of demonstrable <b>stigmata of degeneration</b>.</p>

<p>Lombroso&#8217;s &#8220;born prostitute&#8221; is, above all, distinguished by
a complete lack of the moral sense, by typical &#8220;moral insanity,&#8221;
which is the true &#8220;<b>root</b>&#8221; of the prostitute life, for he regards
that life as very little dependent upon the sexual. Prostitution,
therefore, according to Lombroso, &#8220;is only a special case of the
early tendency to all evil, of the desire which characterizes the
morally idiotic human being from childhood upwards, to do that<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
which is <span class="nowrap">forbidden.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor286"></a><a href="#Footnote286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span>
The individual cause of prostitution,
according to this view, is to be found, not in the sexual, but in
the ethical province. With the ethical defects are associated
greediness, the love of finery, a tendency to drink, vanity, dislike
of work, mendacity, and an inclination towards criminality. To
this moral degeneration there corresponds the presence of stigmata
of degeneration, such as anomalies of the teeth, cleft palate,
abnormal distribution of the hair, prominent ears, asymmetry
of the face, etc.</p>

<p>The above-described type of degenerate woman does, as a fact,
exist. But, in the first place, such women constitute only a
small fraction of prostitutes, and such women are found <b>following
other occupations</b>. Thus, the expression &#8220;born prostitute&#8221; is a
false one; it should run, &#8220;born degenerate,&#8221; for not all born
degenerates become prostitutes.</p>

<p>In the second place, <b>not all degenerate prostitutes are born
degenerates</b>. In many cases the degeneration is a result of the
professional unchastity.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; says Friedrich Hammer, &#8220;who has not personally
investigated the matter can conceive how <b>rapidly</b> and <b>completely</b> the
<b>process of transformation from an honourable girl into a prostitute
proceeds</b>&mdash;the transformation into a street-walker. A few weeks before
she was clean-looking and trim, perhaps with a somewhat frivolous
appearance, but still able to understand the position in which she found
herself; now, however, she seems to have completely &#8216;gone to pieces&#8217;;
she is dirty and verminous, and on her face is an expression of absolute
wretchedness, not, as you perhaps might imagine, of unbridled sensuality&mdash;<b>no,
rather one of indifference</b>, of complete helplessness and loss
of will, of unresponsiveness alike to punishment and to
<span class="nowrap">benefit.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor287"></a><a href="#Footnote287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The earlier investigators of prostitution, including the first of
all, Parent-Duchatelet, did not fail to recognize that the mental
and physical abnormalities of the prostitute were <b>changes</b> due
to her mode of life. In many prostitutes we can observe a
<b>typical obliteration of the secondary and tertiary sexual characters</b>
after a prolonged practice of their profession. Virey remarked,
very justly, that &#8220;in consequence of the frequent embraces of
men, prostitutes gain a more or less masculine appearance&#8221;:
their neck is thicker, their voice harsher and more masculine
(J. J. Virey, &#8220;Woman,&#8221; pp. 157, 158; Leipzig, 1827).</p>

<p>Most prostitutes have done more or less injury to the functions
of the human body, have completely disordered their sexual life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
and are sterile. It is not to be wondered at that this sometimes
manifests itself in their outward appearance&mdash;as, for example, in
the slight development of the breasts, which often amounts to
a simple atrophy. The &#8220;unmistakable development&#8221; of the
tertiary characters of the male in individual prostitutes, which
has led Kurella to propound the interesting hypothesis that
prostitutes are a sub-variety of the
<span class="nowrap">homosexual,<a id="FNanchor288"></a><a href="#Footnote288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span> rests for the
most part upon their assumption of a masculine mode of life
and masculine habits, which in the long-run cannot fail to influence
also the bodily development&mdash;as, for example, smoking and
the excessive use of alcohol, pot-house life, gluttony, and other
masculine habits. The &#8220;deep masculine voice&#8221; of many prostitutes
is unquestionably in most cases the result of the excessive
use of tobacco and alcohol. To this striking <b>gradual</b> change in
the voice Parent-Duchatelet devoted considerable attention
(vol. i., pp. 86-88, of the German edition); it also attracted
Lippert&#8217;s notice. Parent-Duchatelet refers the common development
in prostitutes of the masculine voice to their excessive
indulgence in alcoholic beverages, and to their exposure to
frequent changes of weather (catching cold, etc.). Smoking also
certainly plays a part.</p>

<p>Lippert draws attention to other changes (&#8220;Prostitution in
Hamburg,&#8221; pp. 80 and 90):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;By the daily practice of their profession for many years their eyes
acquire a piercing, rolling expression; they are somewhat unduly
prominent in consequence of the continued tension of the ocular
muscles, since the eyes are principally employed to spy out and attract
clients. In many the organs of mastication are strongly developed;
the mouth, in continuous activity either in eating or in kissing, is conspicuous;
the forehead is often flat; the occipital region is at times
extremely prominent; the hair of the head is often scanty&mdash;in fact, a
good many become actually bald. For this reasons are not lacking:
above all, the restless mode of life; the continued running about in all
weathers in the open street, sometimes with the head bare; the often
long-lasting fluor albus from which they
<span class="nowrap">suffer;<a id="FNanchor289"></a><a href="#Footnote289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span> the incessant brushing,
manipulation, frizzling, and pomading of the hair; and, among the
lower classes of prostitutes, the use of brandy.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The rough voice is the physiological characteristic of the woman
who has lost her proper functions&mdash;those of the mother.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>However, the <b>majority</b> of <b>youthful prostitutes</b> exhibit purely
<b>feminine</b> characteristics; it is only late in life that the above-described<span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span>
type becomes predominant, and this shows us that the
masculine characteristics are the result of <b>objective</b> influences.
From five to ten years bring about a notable difference. In the
year 1898 I treated a maidservant for syphilis. At that time
she was of an elegant, genuinely feminine appearance. Seven
years later, in the year 1905, I saw her once more. What a
change! Her face was bloated and widened; her eyes, once so
bright and clear, had become cloudy and expressionless; her
voice was rough; all the specific feminine forms and characters
had been obliterated by extreme corpulence. It was no longer
a woman, it was a &#8220;prostitute,&#8221; a special type of humanity,
but one which had been <b>gradually produced</b>, and as a result
of no more than six years of the practice of professional
prostitution.</p>

<p>These facts do not by any means exclude the existence of
<b>genuine degenerates</b> among prostitutes in a greater percentage
than among <span class="nowrap">non-prostitutes;<a id="FNanchor290"></a><a href="#Footnote290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
nor do they exclude the existence
of genuine homosexuals among prostitutes. To this extent
Lombroso&#8217;s theory contains a nucleus of truth; but it concerns
only a fraction of the entire world of prostitutes. Lombroso has
himself been repeatedly compelled to recognize the frequency
with which he has encountered among prostitutes women of
normal appearance, and even beautiful
<span class="nowrap">women.<a id="FNanchor291"></a><a href="#Footnote291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, the doctrine of the &#8220;born prostitute&#8221; is contradicted
by the fact that the same types of degenerate which are described
by Lombroso among prostitutes are found also among women
who are not <span class="nowrap">prostitutes.<a id="FNanchor292"></a><a href="#Footnote292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span>
In fact, Lombroso has been led to this
view by the recognition of an &#8220;equivalent of prostitutes among
the upper classes&#8221;; but in this way he has only proved that the
<b>same</b> moral degeneration that is encountered in a certain proportion
of prostitutes is also seen in misconducted women of other
and higher classes. There are, in fact, prostitute natures among
the &#8220;upper ten thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The best limitation of the general value of the doctrine of the
&#8220;born prostitute&#8221; is the concluding chapter of Lombroso&#8217;s book<span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span>
upon &#8220;Occasional Prostitutes.&#8221; He begins with the pertinent
remark:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Not all prostitutes are ethically indifferent&mdash;that is to say, they
are <b>not all born prostitutes</b>; in this province <b>opportunity</b> also plays its
part.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Lombroso proceeds to develop this thesis, thus markedly
limiting the application of his own theory, and recognizing
that, in addition to natural predisposition, quite other causes
and influences come into play in the production of prostitution.</p>

<p>Above all, the <b>economic</b> factors are of greater importance in the
genesis and growth of prostitution, even though their influence
is not an exclusive one.</p>

<p>I distinguish here between <b>real, genuine poverty</b> (lack of food,
proper housing accommodation, etc.) and merely <b>relative poverty</b>.
Hitherto, in considering the economic causes of prostitution,
these two elements have not been distinguished with sufficient
clearness.</p>

<p><b>The fact that real, absolute poverty and lack of the necessaries
of life drives many girls to a life of prostitution can, in view of
recent statistical data, no longer be disputed.</b> More exact material
dealing with this subject is to be found in the above mentioned
writings of Blaschko, one of the principal advocates of the
economic theory of prostitution; also in the works of Georg
<span class="nowrap">Keben,<a id="FNanchor293"></a><a href="#Footnote293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
Oda <span class="nowrap">Olberg,<a id="FNanchor294"></a><a href="#Footnote294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span>
Anna <span class="nowrap">Pappritz,<a id="FNanchor295"></a><a href="#Footnote295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>
Pfeiffer,<a id="FNanchor296"></a><a href="#Footnote296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Paul
<span class="nowrap">Kampffmeyer,<a id="FNanchor297"></a><a href="#Footnote297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span>
E. von <span class="nowrap">D&uuml;ring,<a id="FNanchor298"></a><a href="#Footnote298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>
and many others. Here we have a
superabundant material, a quantity of distressing and tragical
individual data and proofs of Gutzkow&#8217;s thesis, that <b>the material
evils of society always and everywhere undergo transformation
into immorality</b>. Here unquestionably must we <b>first</b> apply the
lever for the removal of this economic predisposing condition of
prostitution. <i>Hic Rhodus, hic salta!</i> I am myself firmly convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
of this fact, although I do <b>not</b> consider that the causes of
prostitution are to be found <b>exclusively</b> in economic conditions&mdash;an
opinion which Anna Pappritz, for example, maintains in the
most extreme form. It is quite true, however, that our entire
sexual life at the present day is so intimately connected with the
<b>social question</b> that the reform of the sexual life demands as an
unconditional preliminary a reform of economic conditions.
Prostitution <b>on the large scale</b>, as it manifests itself in modern
days, and its <b>continuous increase</b> to an extent quite unparalleled
in former times, is only explicable by the rapid transformation
of economic conditions&mdash;as, for example, by the concentration
of population in large towns, by the industrial revolution, and
by the development of great aggregations of capital, by the consequent
greatly increased severity of the struggle for existence,
the postponement of marriage, and the ever-increasing number
of individuals who are not economically and professionally independent.
The increase in <b>child-labour</b> (naturally we refer especially
to children of the female sex) has also to be considered as a
remarkable phenomenon of modern industrial life; but, above
all, we must take into account the fact that <b>woman&#8217;s work</b> is
on the average regarded at a very low valuation, and is paid
accordingly.</p>

<p>The insufficiency of their earnings is the immediate cause of
the fact that so many women and girls seek <b>accessory earnings</b>
in the form of prostitution. It is well known that employers
reckon on this fact in drawing up their pay-lists, and frequently
are so brutally cynical as to point out to their female employees
the possibility of increasing their earnings in this manner&mdash;one
very convenient to the employer!</p>

<p>The <i>Reichsarbeitsblatt</i>, No. 2, of the year 1903, publishes a very
remarkable account of the conditions of work and life of the
<b>unmarried female factory employees</b> in Berlin. It is based upon
the reports of the professional factory inspectors in Berlin, who
have access to material affording them accurate information
regarding the mode of life of factory women. The reports concern
939 unmarried factory hands, and include all occupations
in which in Berlin a considerable number of women were employed.
The average age of the women who came under observation was
22<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> years; the oldest was 54 years; 53&middot;5&nbsp;% of the whole number
were over 21 years of age; 42&nbsp;% were between 16 and 21 years
of age; 4&middot;5&nbsp;% were below 16 years of age. The average number
of hours of daily work was 9<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>; 3&middot;2&nbsp;% of all the women worked
from 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 8 hours; 37&middot;2&nbsp;%, 8 to 9 hours;
47&middot;7&nbsp;%, 9 to 10 hours;<span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span>
and 11&middot;9&nbsp;%, 10 to 11 hours. The weekly wage amounted on the
average to 11&middot;36 marks (shillings); individually, the wages were
very variable; 4&middot;3&nbsp;% of the women were paid less than 6 marks
(shillings); 1&middot;1&nbsp;% were paid from 20 to 30 marks (shillings).
<b>In a very large majority of instances the wages varied between
8 and 15 marks.</b> Supplies from a source independent of their
wages, in the form of money, clothing, and means of subsistence,
were received, according to their own statement, by 88 of the
women; among these, 41 were assisted by parents, 4 by other
relatives, 3 in other ways; 542 of those examined lived with
their parents, 57 with other relatives&mdash;that is, altogether 64&middot;2
of the total number&mdash;21&middot;5&nbsp;% lived in common lodging-houses,
14&nbsp;% in their own rooms. The worst-paid workwomen lived
chiefly with their parents; as soon as the wage sufficed to support
them away from home a great many left their parents&#8217;
houses. The housing accommodation was ascertained in 846
instances; in 758 of these a single room constituted the dwelling,
in 82 cases a kitchen, in 2 cases an attic, in 3 some other room.
In isolated cases quite unsuitable places were used to sleep in.
<b>Speaking generally, the conditions were worse</b> than appears from
the above figures. Of 832 workwomen, only 169 had a room to
themselves; 193 slept in a room with one other person, and 470&mdash;that
is, 56&middot;6&nbsp;%&mdash;<b>with several persons</b>. With regard to the
cost of their dwellings, there were 464 reports; the average payment
was 1&middot;79 marks (shillings) per week. The cost of the food
(dinner and lesser meals) amounted on the average, in the case
of 568, to 6&middot;77 marks (shillings); of these, 205 paid less than
6 marks (shillings), 109 more than 8 marks (shillings) per week.
The total cost for lodging and food amounted in the case of 867
workwomen on the average to 7&middot;62 marks; 44&middot;7&nbsp;% had their
principal meal at midday; 55&middot;3&nbsp;% in the evening; 79&middot;4&nbsp;% took
it at home; 9&middot;4&nbsp;% in the factory; 11&middot;2&nbsp;% in a public kitchen, a
cooking-school, or an eating-house. With regard to the expenditure
for clothing, etc., <b>very scanty</b> details were obtained&mdash;too
scanty to be worth recording. Of the 939 workwomen of whom
inquiry was made on the point, 197, or 21&nbsp;%, contributed money
to the education or support of relatives or children; about 10&nbsp;%
paid (direct) taxes, with a mean expenditure of 8 pfennige (one
penny) per week. For amusement, 233 women recorded an
average weekly expenditure of 1 mark (shilling). To a considerable
number of those examined it was possible to put a little
money by; in most cases the amount averaged from half to one
mark (sixpence to one shilling) per week; in many cases, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span>
the money saved <b>was spent at some other time during the year</b>,
in consequence of diminished earnings or illness. The figures
obtained, although in many cases they require further examination,
elaboration, and illustration, still suffice to show that much
remains to be done for the improvement of the conditions of life
of female factory employees.</p>

<p>That these wages are quite insufficient is shown by the following
table of the daily expenditure of a sempstress for food
and lodging (based on the reports of von St&uuml;lpnagel):</p>

<p>That amounts per week to 8 marks 40 pfennige (eight shillings
and fivepence) for board-lodging. For the rest, clothing, washing,
and a little amusement, have to be provided for, and this is only
possible in the case of the highest wages, varying from 12 to 15
marks; but this higher wage <b>often enough</b> suffices, as Anna
Pappritz herself admits. In many cases the weekly wage is only
5 to 8 marks. In the majority of occupations connected with
the manufacture of ready-made clothing, trade is only brisk for
four to six months in each year. Thus, there is necessarily a
great deal of unemployment.</p>

<p>According to the report of the Statistical Bureau, the average
yearly income of women factory employees throughout the
German Empire was only 322 marks!</p>

<p>It is, therefore, no matter for surprise that the industrial councillors
of Frankfurt-on-the-Main and of Wiesbaden, in their published
reports on the wages of female factory employees for the
year 1887, state:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In Frankfurt, at the end of last month, among 226 persons under
the observation of the <i>police des m&#339;urs</i> (that is, not reckoning secret
prostitution), 98 were female factory employees. Since for their
necessary bare support (food and sleeping accommodation only), the
minimum daily sum needed is 1&middot;25 marks, it appears that the wages
which can be earned by female employees of 1&middot;50 to 1&middot;80 marks can
hardly suffice to provide for all their needs. It would seem, therefore,
that the lowness of their earnings must play some part in the matter
under discussion.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The reports of the industrial councillors of D&uuml;sseldorf, Posen,
Stettin, Neuss, Barmen, Elberfeld, Gladbach, Erfurt, etc., have
a similar signification.</p>

<p>Important in relation to the incontrovertible connexion between
material poverty and prostitution is the fact that in the majority
of cases the prostitution of female factory employees is only
<b>occasional</b>, and not professional prostitution&mdash;that is to say, such
women have recourse to prostitution only when compelled thereto
by deficient means.</p>

<p>As regards genuine <b>professional</b> prostitution, female factory
employees, who live in a state of comparative freedom, contribute
a smaller contingent of recruits than <b>maidservants</b>, whose
position is always a <b>more dependent</b> one, and who are much less
experienced in the struggle for existence, although, generally
speaking, they live in better conditions. From a computation
based upon figures for the years 1855, 1873, and 1898 (those for
1855 and 1898 relating to far too small a number of cases),
Blaschko derives the opinion that formerly female factory
employees provided a greater number of recruits to prostitution
than they do at present; but that, on the contrary, the contribution
of maidservants to the ranks of professional prostitution has
enormously increased. This assertion cannot pass without contradiction.
Gross-Hoffinger, in the work previously mentioned,
pointed out that the class of maidservants was the true nucleus
of prostitution, and devoted to this fact a long and illuminating
chapter of his book. And at about the same time (1848) Lippert
also wrote (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 79): &#8220;The principal sources of prostitution
are <b>maidservants</b>, sempstresses, flower-girls, tailoresses, hairdressers,
shop-girls, and barmaids.&#8221; (Gross-Hoffinger himself
emphasizes the word &#8220;<b>maidservants</b>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that the preponderance of ex-maidservants
in the ranks of professional prostitution is by no means a new
phenomenon, although, possibly, that preponderance is even
<b>greater</b> now than it was in former times. And though in isolated
instances it may happen that simple poverty forces a maidservant<span class="pagenum" id="Page334">[334]</span>
to become a prostitute, this explanation does not suffice for the
generality of cases. The same reservation must be made in
respect of seduction and illegitimate motherhood as causes of
prostitution. And in so far as poverty is a cause, we must speak
rather of <b>relative</b> poverty, poverty which has more of a subjective
than an objective character.</p>

<p>Schiller rightly remarks, in his admirable essay on the &#8220;Prevention
of Prostitution,&#8221; that in respect of prostitutes who have
been maidservants, in the majority of cases there can be no
question of insufficient wages and actual poverty (if we except
the badly paid servants in public-houses, laundry-maids, and a
few others), since the maidservant receives, in addition to her
wages, free board and lodging, and therefore is in a much better
position than the majority of female factory employees and of
women engaged in home industries. Notwithstanding this, maidservants
supply the largest proportion of prostitutes.</p>

<p>The majority of maidservants come from the country, where lax
views prevail regarding sexual relationships. In addition, girls
usually come to town when still very young. The want of education
and experience of life is, in their case, very striking; and this
is increased by their permanently dependent position, in contrast
with the early independence of the town factory-women, who are
speedily initiated into all the possible evils of town life. In addition,
there comes into the question an influence which hitherto
has been underestimated: the <b>love of finery</b>. Among maidservants
this is especially powerful, since, in this respect, they are continually
exposed to suggestive influences, arising from the clothing
of their mistresses. This love of dress, in association with a far
greater unscrupulousness in sexual matters than exists among
workwomen, drives many servant-girls, even <b>without</b> real poverty,
to prostitution. After they have lost their place, after they have
acquired a distaste for work, have given birth to an illegitimate
child, or have been infected with venereal disease, they very
readily enter the ranks of professional prostitution.</p>

<p>This <b>subjective psychological</b> factor plays nearly as great a r&ocirc;le
as the economic factor. Blaschko himself draws attention to the
fact that, in proportion to the hundreds of thousands of women
who are compelled to earn their bread by hard, badly paid toil,
the number of those who ultimately become prostitutes is really
almost infinitesimally small; and that, therefore, we must regard
as accessory causes of prostitution, defective will-power, want of
industry, of perseverance, and of moral instincts, and, finally, also&mdash;and
here Lombroso is justified&mdash;congenital deficiency. Hellpach<span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span>
is right when, in his most readable essay on &#8220;Prostitution
and Prostitutes&#8221; (Berlin, 1905), he lays the principal stress on
this &#8220;social-psychological&#8221; explanation of prostitution, and
regards the purely economic factor as &#8220;the ultimate turning-point&#8221;
in the fatal road that leads to prostitution. (Earlier
than Hellpach, Anton Baumgarten attempted to give a social-psychological
explanation of prostitution. See his essays, containing
much valuable material, &#8220;Police and Prostitution,&#8221; and
&#8220;The Relations of Prostitution to Crime,&#8221; published in the eighth
and eleventh volumes respectively of the &#8220;Archives of Criminal
Anthropology.&#8221;)</p>

<p>We must, therefore, hold firmly to the fact that the most
<b>diverse</b> and <b>heterogeneous</b> vital conditions may ultimately lead
to prostitution. Among these, <b>lack of education</b>, <b>premature
habituation</b> to sexual depravation by <b>casual observation</b> and by
<b>deliberate seduction</b>, play an important r&ocirc;le. And these causes
are themselves to a large extent secondary to the <b>miserable housing
conditions</b> in great towns, recently so dramatically described by
von Pfeiffer and Kampffmeyer.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is easier,&#8221; says Pfeiffer, &#8220;to thunder against immorality from
the top of a lofty tower, than it is to resist every allurement in dull,
narrow dwellings, in the midst of poverty and deprivation.... The
lodger flirts with the wife; the married or free-loving pair, also living
in the house, do not wait to begin their caresses until the children are
out of the way. The children are witnesses of many scenes which are
little adapted to the preservation of pure morals; they see things
which they later come to regard as matters of course, and when they
have the opportunity they act in the same way themselves, for they
have not learned otherwise, and they think that every one does the
same....</p>

<p>&#8220;The servant-girl becomes pregnant; no one knows what has become
of her child&#8217;s father. Driven out of her place, she remembers that she
has a married sister, and after long search she finds her in a damp
basement dwelling. This dwelling consists of a single room and a dark
kitchen; three shivering, dirty children are playing on the floor; the
husband is out of employment; but still they can find room for this
sister-in-law and her illegitimate child. Then perhaps there are better
days for a time. But within the narrow limits of the one-roomed
dwelling the association is too intimate, and the sister-in-law again
becomes pregnant, and ultimately in the same week both the sisters
are delivered as the result of impregnation by the same man. When
we think how all this has taken place in the <b>only</b> available room, we can
understand that the children must have seen a great deal little suited
to childish eyes.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The housing statistics of Berlin for the year 1900 give horrible
reports regarding this, and even much worse conditions&mdash;conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span>
which are sufficiently explained when we consider how often
families living in a single room take in a <b>male</b> or a <b>female lodger</b>
for the night. One-roomed dwellings in which from four to seven
sleep every night are common; those in which eight to ten sleep
are by no means rare!</p>

<p>After what has been said above, no elaborate demonstration is
needed to show that <b>alcoholism</b> everywhere, in the most diverse
conditions, prepares the soil for prostitution. Kr&auml;pelin and
O. Rosenthal have thoroughly exposed this intimate connexion
between prostitution and alcoholism.</p>

<p>An even more important source of prostitution is to be found
in <b>procurement</b> and in the <b>traffic in girls</b>&mdash;this grave social evil
of our time. How often are children initiated into the practice of
prostitution, for the sake of pecuniary gain, by their own parents,
or by some other individual devoid of all moral feeling, and taught
to serve as mere instruments of earning money by lust! Paris
offers more examples of this traffic than any other European city,
but London is not far behind, as was proved by the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i> scandals of 1883, to which we shall return in another connexion.
In Berlin itself in recent years the number of half-grown,
and even childish, prostitutes has enormously increased.
Prostitutes from thirteen to fourteen years of age are no longer
rare.</p>

<p>An even sadder phenomenon is the modern <b>traffic in girls</b>, a
characteristic product of the age of commerce, although earlier
times were, indeed, familiar with it, especially France in the
eighteenth <span class="nowrap">century,<a id="FNanchor299"></a><a href="#Footnote299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span>
witness more especially the accounts of the
celebrated <i>Parc-aux-Cerfs</i>.</p>

<p>The modern traffic in <span class="nowrap">girls<a id="FNanchor300"></a><a href="#Footnote300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
is intimately connected with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page337">[337]</span>
<b>brothel question</b>. We can, in fact, assert that if there were no
brothels there would be no traffic in girls. This is proved also
by the <b>growing dislike</b> to brothels felt by prostitutes, who prefer
a free life. For this reason, it becomes more and more difficult
for the keepers of brothels to obtain inmates, and the international
traffic in girls attempts to fill the continually increasing deficiency
in the number of girls entering brothels.</p>

<p>The traffic in girls is to-day almost exclusively recruited from
Eastern Europe. As regards its original sources, we find that
Galicia&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Austrian Poland&mdash;supplies 40&nbsp;%, Russia 15&nbsp;%,
Italy 11&nbsp;%, Austria-Hungary 10&nbsp;%, Germany 8&nbsp;%, of the &#8220;White
Slave Trade.&#8221; Most of the girls are transported to the Argentine,
where we find them in the
<span class="nowrap">brothels.<a id="FNanchor301"></a><a href="#Footnote301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>The traders in girls, or &#8220;kaften&#8221; as they are called in Brazil,
are, for the most part, Polish Jews. Rosenack shows, in his
report on the campaign against the traffic in girls (a campaign
actively taken up by the Western European Jewish Unions, and
especially by the Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls
and Women), that five out of six of the Galician Jews engaged
in this traffic are what are called &#8220;Luftmenschen&#8221; (men of air)&mdash;that
is, men without any definite or secure means of livelihood&mdash;and
that only an improvement in their social conditions can put
an end to the traffic in girls. As regards that part of the world,
he considers that the measures resolved upon by the <b>National</b>
and <b>International Conference for the Suppression of the Traffic
in Girls</b> (Berlin, 1903; Frankfurt-on-the-Main, 1905) are not
adapted to offer any important hindrances to the traffic. More
effective has been the work of the Jewish Branch Committee in
Germany for the suppression of the Galician traffic in girls. Dr.
Rosenack, Berta Pappenheim, and Dr. Sera Rabinowitsch, in
furtherance of the work of the committee, studied the local conditions;
the population was instructed verbally and by leaflets
and pamphlets. Endeavours have been made to improve the
economic condition of the workwomen of Galicia. For this purpose,
instructed female assistants are sent from Germany to
Galicia. It has been possible to awaken in Galicia general<span class="pagenum" id="Page338">[338]</span>
interest in the work of the suppression of traffic in girls. In a
Conference held at Lemberg, the Galician clubs and Jewish committees
made representations to German and other societies, in
order to formulate a plan, and to devise measures for the improvement
of Galician conditions.</p>

<p>In Buenos Ayres, the principal town of entry for Galician girls,
a committee has been formed to oppose the traffic in girls, the
members of this committee being of all religions and nationalities.
This has had one good effect&mdash;that the traders in girls have
become alarmed; they no longer practise their profession so
openly as before. The Argentine police are also taking an active
part in the fight with the traffic. Not more than two of the judges
at Buenos Ayres were found to make common cause with the
&#8220;traders,&#8221; and to discharge them on receipt of large bribes. A
law has been drafted for the punishment of those engaged in this
traffic, by imprisonment for six years and confiscation of their
property.</p>

<p>The traders in girls constitute an international ring, and the
centre of their organization is in Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>In Berlin, since 1904, there has existed a <b>central police organization</b>
for the suppression of the international traffic in girls, the
activity of which extends throughout the Empire. Every case
of this traffic which comes to the notice of the police in Germany
is reported to the central police organization. This draws up a
list of all the traders in girls whose names are definitely known.
It has started an album containing photographs of traders who
have been punished, and it exchanges experiences with the police
of other countries. It is to be hoped that in comparison with the
other countries of Europe the number of German girls exported
to brothels abroad will continually grow smaller, and that the
local measures undertaken in Galicia and the Argentine will have
a good effect in limiting, and ultimately suppressing, this traffic.</p>

<p>Henne am Rhyn has shown that to and from other countries&mdash;for
example, from England to Belgium and Germany (Hamburg),
from Galicia to Turkey, from Italy to North America, etc.&mdash;individual
girls are transported. According to Felix Baumann,
the number of traders in girls in New York approaches 20,000.
They have close relations to the police, and they employ young
handsome men, called &#8220;cadets,&#8221; to attract the girls. The abolition
of brothels would here also be the best means of abolishing
the traffic in girls.</p>

<p>Having now learned the sources of prostitution, we must proceed
to give a brief account of the places in which it is carried on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page339">[339]</span>
Here we have first of all to distinguish <b>public</b> from <b>secret</b> prostitution.</p>

<p>As regards public prostitution, there are only <b>two</b> principal
varieties to consider: street prostitution, where the women seek
their victims in the streets, in order to carry them off either to
their <b>own dwellings</b> or to <b>houses of accommodation</b>; and <b>brothel
prostitution</b>. At the present day in most countries public street
prostitution is far the most general form, and this is especially
true as regards Germany, where in a few towns only brothels
continue to exist. In many places this street prostitution&mdash;for
example, in the Friedrichstrasse of Berlin, and also on the
boulevards of Paris&mdash;gives rise to conditions which recall the
worst days of imperial Rome. The <b>contact</b> between public life
and professional prostitution is unquestionably a great evil. The
activity of prostitutes in the open streets, the shameless and
lascivious display of their sexual charms, their bold solicitation
<i>coram publico</i>, the stimulating character of professional unchastity&mdash;all
these poison our public life, obliterate the boundary between
cleanliness and contamination, and display daily a picture of
sexual corruption&mdash;alike before the eyes of the pure, blameless
girl, those of the honourable wife, and those of the immature boy.
Aptly has this <b>street</b> prostitution been termed the <i>cloaca</i> of our
social life, which empties into the open street, whereas at least
<b>brothel</b> prostitution only represented a hidden <i>cloaca</i>, whose offensive
odour need not annoy all the world, as inevitably happens in
the case of street prostitution. In addition, we have to consider
the serious dangers involved in the practice of professional fornication
in private dwellings and houses of accommodation, as they
involve the decent families living in such houses. What do the
children living in such houses see and hear? Frequently prostitutes
are admitted to confidential family intercourse, and they
seduce the daughters of poor people to join them in the practice
of prostitution, and the sons to a vicious life or to become souteneurs.
That the danger of contamination of the lower classes
of the population by means of prostitution is by no means
imaginary, is clearly shown by numerous examples from actual
life. I subscribe to all that the advocates of brothels say in this
respect.</p>

<p>And yet <b>brothels</b> are a <b>still</b> greater evil! They constitute an
incomparably <b>more dangerous</b> centre of <b>sexual corruption</b>, a
worse <b>breeding-ground of sexual aberrations</b> of every kind, and
last, not least, the <b>greatest focus of sexual infection</b>. With reference
to the last point, the matter will be discussed more fully in<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
the chapter dealing with the question of regulation in connexion
with the suppression of venereal diseases.</p>

<p>The brothel is the <b>high-school</b> of refined sexual lust and perversity.
The detailed proof of this I must leave to the descriptions
of the two writers most experienced in the life of brothels,
L&eacute;o <span class="nowrap">Taxil<a id="FNanchor302"></a><a href="#Footnote302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
and Louis <span class="nowrap">Fiaux.<a id="FNanchor303"></a><a href="#Footnote303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fact well known to all that many young men learn in
brothels for the first time the manifold and artificial ways in
which natural sexual intercourse can be replaced by perverse
methods of sexual activity. <b>Here, in the brothel, psychopathia
sexualis is systematically taught.</b> And what the old debauchee
demands from the prostitute and pays her for, perverse intercourse,
is <b>spontaneously offered to the youthful initiate</b>, because
competition between the prostitutes, and the hope of a higher
payment, lead them to do so. The opinion of the French authors
just mentioned is perfectly credible&mdash;that there are young men
who in this way have learned about perverse sexuality <b>before</b>
they were fully acquainted with natural sexuality, and who thus
have permanently acquired more inclination for these mysteries
of Venus than for a natural and normal sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>Brothel-jargon</b>,&#8221; or &#8220;<b>brothel-slang</b>,&#8221; contains a number of
words almost peculiar to this dialect, by which the contra-natural,
abnormal methods of sexual intercourse are denoted in
a more or less cynical manner; for example, <i>faire feuille de
rose</i> = anilinctus; <i>sfogliar la rosa</i> (to pluck the leaves from the
rose) = p&aelig;dicare; <i>faire t&ecirc;te-b&ecirc;che</i> = reciprocal cunnilinctus of two
tribades; <i>punta di penna</i> = masturbatio labialis; <i>pulci lavoratrici</i>
(learned fleas!) = tribades, etc.</p>

<p>A learned investigator like Fiaux is led by his observations of
many years to the conclusion that <b>brothels</b> constitute not only
the most <b>dangerous</b> form of public prostitution, but the most
dangerous kind of prostitution that exists at all, and that it is
urgently necessary that they should be abolished in all countries
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In addition to the two varieties and localities of &#8220;public&#8221;
prostitution&mdash;that is, prostitution carried on under the observation
of the police&mdash;there is a much more extensive <b>secret</b> prostitution,
in connexion with which, however, the word &#8220;secret&#8221; must
always be accepted with reserve, since in its case also it comes
more or less under the eye of the public. This secret prostitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page341">[341]</span>
is, for example, accessible at numerous places, and these are very
different one from another. Secret prostitution also has its
types, its peculiarities&mdash;in short, its definite local colouring,
according to the place in which it is practised. Let us give a
brief account of the various localities of secret prostitution.</p>

<p id="Ref1">1. <b>Public-houses with Women Attendants, the so-called &#8220;Animierkneipen.&#8221;</b>&mdash;The
<b>waitress</b> (barmaid) is the true exemplar of the
secret prostitute, and further, in consequence of the perpetual
association with alcoholism, is the most dangerous
<span class="nowrap">variety;<a id="FNanchor304"></a><a href="#Footnote304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span> for
the barmaid allures the guest even more to the excessive consumption
of alcohol than to sexual indulgence. For this purpose
barmaids receive a percentage of the receipts from the sale of
liquor, and this sum, in addition to free board, is their only wage.</p>

<p>The <span class="nowrap">&#8220;animierkneipen&#8221;<a id="FNanchor305"></a><a href="#Footnote305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span>
and the restaurants with women
attendants can be plainly distinguished from a considerable
distance by their <b>curtained</b> windows, and by the <b>red, green, or
blue glass panes</b> over the doors of entry. These coloured panes
are so characteristic of these places of lust and gluttony that at
the last year&#8217;s District Synod of the Friedrichswerder section of
the town of Berlin the attempt was made (<i>cf.</i> <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>,
No. 248, May 30, 1906) to forbid the use of such illuminated
panes for the advertisement of the houses of entertainment in
Berlin with female attendants. To this proposal the reasonable
objection was made that if this distinguishing mark were abolished,
there would be no means of recognizing such places, and therefore
no warning signal for blameless individuals.</p>

<p>Many &#8220;animierkneipen&#8221;&mdash;the French similarly term the girls
in such places &#8220;<i>les</i>
<span class="nowrap"><i>inviteuses</i>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor306"></a><a href="#Footnote306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>&mdash;by
their mysterious-looking
interior; by the heavy curtains, which produce semi-obscurity; by
small very discreet <i>chambres s&eacute;par&eacute;es</i>, lighted by little coloured
lanterns and with erotic pictures on the walls; by their Spanish
walls and their enormous couches&mdash;obtain the appearance of small
lupanars. To these the richer customers and the initiates are
brought, whilst the ordinary habitual guests commonly assemble
in the larger bars, where also music&mdash;it must be admitted very<span class="pagenum" id="Page342">[342]</span>
bad music&mdash;in the form of a piano- or a zither-player, is not
wanting.</p>

<p>The whole shameless activity of these &#8220;animierkneipen,&#8221; in
which alcohol and indecency play the principal r&ocirc;le, has recently
been described by Hermann Seyffert in a manner no less perspicuous
than true to <span class="nowrap">life.<a id="FNanchor307"></a><a href="#Footnote307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span>
The clients of such places are, for
the most part, immature lads, who squander here the money of
their parents or their employers; but we find there also the
habitual guests, usually elderly married men, who find in this
atmosphere a welcome variety in comparison with the monotony
of their homes. The quantities of alcohol which are consumed
in the &#8220;animierkneipen,&#8221; both by the guests and by the attendants,
are enormous. The barmaids must always drink at the
cost of the guests, in order that the sales of liquor may be larger.
O. <span class="nowrap">Rosenthal<a id="FNanchor308"></a><a href="#Footnote308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span>
speaks of barmaids who consume twenty to thirty
glasses of beer a day, and more, without mentioning brandy and
liqueurs!</p>

<p>2. <b>Ball-Rooms and</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>Dancing-Saloons.</b><a id="FNanchor309"></a><a
href="#Footnote309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span>&mdash;Properly
speaking, these
are only a sub-variety of the places described in Section 1; they
are enlarged &#8220;animierkneipen,&#8221; with the addition of (better)
music and of dancing. But the beautiful days of the Bal Mabille
and the Closerie des Lilas, or of Cremorne Gardens, the Portland
Rooms, the Argyll Rooms, and the Orpheum have long passed
away. The majority of the ball-rooms of Berlin and Paris (in
London they disappeared long ago) have sunk to a lower level.
Prostitution is now dominant. The &#8220;intimacy,&#8221; which in the
earlier more idyllic ball-rooms felt so much at home, is now no
longer to be found there. It is only necessary to visit the celebrated
ball-rooms of Berlin&mdash;the Ballhaus in the Joachimstrasse,
the &#8220;Blumens&auml;le,&#8221; etc., not to speak of the seats of baser
prostitution, as, for example, Lestmann&#8217;s Dancing-Saloon&mdash;in
order to be aware of this fact. Here also the principal thing is
drinking, and always more drinking! In Paris, in the dancing-rooms
of Montmartre, we can see the &#8220;inviteuses&#8221; in full cry;
some of the French dancing-rooms, however, appear more attractive
from the &aelig;sthetic point of view than the haunts of Terpsichore
in Berlin. A dancing-saloon that was not exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span>
concerned with prostitution was that of Emberg in the Schumannstrasse,
but in the year 1906 this was closed for ever. Now,
similar great ball-rooms exist, properly speaking, only in the
suburbs&mdash;in Halensee, Gr&uuml;nau, Nieder-Sch&ouml;nhausen, etc. Here
also, however, the dance is not the principal thing&mdash;procurement
and prostitution are widely diffused, as was pointed out fifty
years ago by Thomas Bade in his essay, in this respect most convincing,
&#8220;Ueber Gelegenheitsmacherei und &Ouml;ffentliches Tanzvergn&uuml;gen&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Procurement
in Relation to Public Ball-Rooms&#8221;
(Berlin, 1858).</p>

<p>3. <b>Variety Theatres, Low Music-Halls, and Cabarets.</b>&mdash;The principal
object of these places, so characteristic of our time, is &#8220;to
kill time&#8221; in as amusing a manner as possible, &#8220;amusement&#8221;
being what the &#8220;average sensual man&#8221; of to-day, dull and
empty-headed, demands. What he wants is the satisfaction of
his desire for sensations by the appearance of more or less d&eacute;collet&eacute;
singers, dancers, acrobats, male and female, by the representation
of tableaux vivants in which the parts are played by
beautiful women, by the kinematograph, or by pantomime, by
spicy songs, by the performance of clever jugglers, by wrestling
and boxing matches between men and women, by juggling, and
all kinds of spectacles, etc. In short, the most diverse &#8220;varieties&#8221;&mdash;hence
the name&mdash;of amusement are offered here, and it is significant
that these places of pleasure first appeared in the great
seaports of Liverpool, London, Hamburg, and Marseilles, where
the sailors, after the weary monotony of long sea voyages, found
satisfaction in the variegated display of enjoyment offered to
them in such places. Now the monotony, the emptiness of their
life, drives innumerable crowds of townsmen to the variety
theatres, which, even though as little as the drinking-saloons
can they be called true &#8220;places&#8221; of prostitution, still serve as
localities in which prostitutes meet their clients; and in this way
evening after evening a large number use them as the field of
their activities.</p>

<p>The lowest class of variety theatre, the &#8220;<i>Tingel-Tangel</i>&#8221; (low
music-hall), also euphemistically called &#8220;Academy of Music,&#8221; is,
in fact, nothing more than a brothel, the only difference being
that the actual sexual intercourse does not take place in the
house itself, as so often occurs in the similar &#8220;animierkneipen.&#8221;
The singers appearing in these &#8220;tingel-tangel&#8221; are all low-class
prostitutes. In most cases, whilst one of their number is practising
the &#8220;art of song&#8221; (<i>sit venia verbo</i>), the others, sitting about
the hall in shameless d&eacute;collet&eacute;, display their charms, and incite<span class="pagenum" id="Page344">[344]</span>
(&#8220;animieren&#8221;) the visitors to drink. Clerks and students form
the indulgent audience; in seaport towns the audience consists
generally of sailors. Who is not familiar with the most celebrated
tingel-tangel streets in the world, the Spielbudenplatz and
the Reeperbahn, in St. Pauli, near the docks of Hamburg? In
these streets we see one variety theatre after another, and all are
crowded by a smoking, drinking audience, taking part in the
choruses of the songs. A peculiar kind of these places of pleasure
is constituted by the so-called &#8220;<b>Rummel</b>,&#8221; a speciality of Berlin.
Wherever, within or without the town limits, by the demolition
of old houses or in any other way, a large area remains free from
building for a considerable time, these tingel-tangel proprietors
invade the place, erect merry-go-rounds and cake-stalls, and there
develops in the place a manifold activity, in which the lower
classes of the population exclusively share. Here the very lowest
types of prostitute seek their prey, and find it.</p>

<p>4. &#8220;<b>Boarding-Houses</b>&#8221; (&#8220;<b>Pensionate</b>&#8221;) <b>and Maisons de Passe</b>
(<b>Houses of Accommodation</b>).&mdash;Anyone walking through the streets
of Berlin will not fail to notice boards at the doors of certain
houses, bearing the inscription, &#8220;Here rooms can be hired by the
month, week, or day.&#8221; I do not assert that this announcement
<b>always</b> represents an invitation to fornication, or the provision
of an opportunity therefor; but in many cases these announcements
serve as indications of the &#8220;intercourse&#8221; obtainable in
such dwellings. Often several stories, or even the entire house,
is devoted to this purpose. It professes to be a &#8220;Private Hotel&#8221;
or Furnished Lodgings; but in reality it is a masked brothel, a
&#8220;house of accommodation&#8221; for prostitutes and their clients, a
place in which the landlord&mdash;in most cases the landlord is of the
female sex&mdash;has for principal occupation the practice of procurement.
Other dwellings, <b>without</b> these sufficiently well-known and
suspicious boards attached to the door-posts, passing under the
less striking name of a &#8220;pension,&#8221; are adapted rather for the
exquisite and artificial enjoyment of the richer classes, and are
employed for sexual orgies of a more extensive character, for
the procurement and seduction of young girls, and for the
assignations of the higher classes of the demi-monde and their
client&egrave;le.</p>

<p>5. &#8220;<b>Massage Institutes.</b>&#8221;&mdash;To these distinctly modern establishments,
which mainly subserve the purposes of masochistic
prostitution, we shall return in the chapter on masochism. Many
prostitutes have some knowledge of massage, and masquerade as
&#8220;masseuses&#8221;; their supplementary profession is ordinary prostitution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page345">[345]</span>
and for this reason we are justified in alluding to them in
this section.</p>

<p>6. <b>The Weibercaf&eacute;s.</b>&mdash;These are found in all the large towns,
especially in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Buda-Pesth, and
they serve as the principal places in which <b>prostitution is carried
on by day</b>. Prostitutes sit here in great numbers hour after
hour, and wait for their clients, who, of course, must pay for
drinks which are consumed. Certain caf&eacute;s in Berlin&mdash;as, for
example, the &#8220;Caf&eacute; National,&#8221; the Caf&eacute; Keck in the Leipziger
Strasse, etc.&mdash;are typical <b>nocturnal cafes</b>, in which from the
onset of darkness until early in the morning prostitutes await
their clients.</p>

<p>Naturally, the above classification does not include all varieties
of modern prostitution, which exhibits many other modes of
activity. Most of these others, however, have some sort of
relationship to the varieties already described, and it is, therefore,
unnecessary to deal with them all at length. Prostitution
can, of course, be practised anywhere; and its allurements are
found in all places in which great numbers of human beings come
together.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX<br />
THE HALF-WORLD</h3>

<p>To prostitution in the wider sense of the term belongs also the
&#8220;<b>half-world</b>&#8221; (&#8220;demi-monde&#8221;), under which name, first used
by the younger Dumas, we include the various categories of
&#8220;mistresses,&#8221; femmes soutenues (kept women), lorettes, cocottes,
and fast women.</p>

<p>Alexandre Dumas, in the celebrated passage of his play &#8220;Demi-Monde&#8221;
(Act II., Scene 9), gives by the mouth of Olivier de
Jalin the following definition of the half-world:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;All these women have made a false step in their past; they have a
small black spot upon their name, and they go in company as much as
possible, so that the spot may be less conspicuous. They have the
same origin, the same appearance, the same prejudices as good society;
but they no longer belong to it, and they form that which we call the
half-world (demi-monde), which floats like an island upon the ocean
of Paris, and draws towards itself, assumes, and recognizes, everything
which falls from the firm land, or which wanders out or runs away
from the firm land, without counting the foreign shipwrecked individuals
who come no man knows whence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the married men, under the protection of the legal code, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page346">[346]</span>
had the right to banish from the bosom of the family a woman who has
forgotten her duty, the morals of married life have undergone a revolution
which has created a new world&mdash;for what becomes of all these
expelled, compromised women? The first of them who found herself
shown the door, bewailed her fault, and hid her shame in retirement;
but&mdash;the second? She sought the first one out, and as soon as there
were two of them, they called the fault a misfortune, the crime a mistake,
and began to make excuses for one another mutually. Having
become three, they asked one another to dinner; having become four&mdash;they
danced a quadrille. Now round these women there grouped themselves
young girls also who had begun their life with a false step; false
widows; women who bore the name of the lovers with whom they
lived; some of those rapid &#8216;marriages&#8217; which had lasted as liaisons of
many years&#8217; duration; finally, all the women who wished people to
believe that they were something else than they really were, and did
not wish to appear in their true colours. At the present day this
irregular world is in full bloom, and its bastard society is greatly loved
by young men. For here love is less difficult than in circles above&mdash;and
not so expensive as in circles below.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>From the last sentence we see that the original idea of the
&#8220;half-world&#8221; was not so wide as that of the present day; above
all, the former notion did not, as it does at present, include the
idea of prostitution. The ladies of the half-world of Dumas were
&#8220;not so expensive&#8221; as ordinary prostitutes. Our modern demi-mondaines
are characterized by the fact that their price is high.
They are prostitutes for the upper ten thousand. And yet they
have this in common with the other demi-monde&mdash;that they do
not, like prostitutes properly speaking, give themselves indifferently
to anyone able to pay the price, but they lay stress on the
social position of their lover for the time being, and upon his
character as a &#8220;gentleman.&#8221; They can even exhibit something
of the nature of love. The modern half-world can most aptly
be compared with the Greek hetairism. It forms a characteristic
constituent of modern &#8220;high life.&#8221; Whether this especially
manifests itself on the racecourse, at first nights at the theatre,
in great charitable bazaars, at masked balls, at fashionable seaside
resorts, at Monte Carlo, at floral festivals, and the like, there
also we encounter the half-world; and its members, in respect of
beauty, toilet, distinguished appearance, cultivation, and conversation,
are in no way to be distinguished from the ladies of
high society. Certain types of the demi-monde realize, in fact,
the ideal of the Greek hetair&aelig;; but even more than these, the
modern demi-mondaine represents elaborated enjoyment. These
women are thoroughly cultivated, the true law-givers of fashion,
the arbiters in every question of taste. Mondaines and demi-mondaines
are in outward appearance hardly to be distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span>
one from the other; at least, this is the case in Paris, where a
witty writer defined the distinction between them in this way&mdash;that
the former received their lovers only in the daytime, the
latter also by <span class="nowrap">night.<a id="FNanchor310"></a><a href="#Footnote310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span>
It is only the connoisseur who is able to
detect the &#8220;half-world aroma,&#8221; that indefinable quality which
gives the demi-mondaine such an exceptional value in the eyes
of the <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>From what circles do the recruits of the half-world come?
The ladies of the theatre, the stars of the variety stage and of
the ballet, send their contingent; the aristocracy is also represented
in their ranks; but many a distinguished lorette or &#8220;fille
de marbre&#8221; is of low origin, and yet understands admirably
how to adapt herself rapidly to all the demands of high life, to
drive her dog-cart as smartly as the most genuine Countess, and
in Longchamps, Karlshorst, Ostend, or Trouville, to play the
part of the fine lady.</p>

<p>The one distinction between them&mdash;and it is the distinction of
half a world&mdash;is the fact that this fashionable life of the demi-monde
is not provided out of their own means, but out of the
pockets of one, or more often of several, rich galants.</p>

<p>The type of the &#8220;grande cocotte&#8221; is encountered in its genuine
and unadulterated form only in Paris. Here the demi-mondaine
plays a great part in public life. The time of the earlier mistresses
of princes, with their political intrigues and their far-reaching
spheres of influence, is indeed over&mdash;a Lola Montez, an
Aurora K&ouml;nigsmark is to-day no longer possible; and yet the
Parisian demi-mondaine maintains influential relationships with
the new great power of our time&mdash;the power of the <b>press</b>. The
journalists who are in the service of the demi-monde are by George
Dahlen termed the &#8220;Press-Fridoline,&#8221; because &#8220;their pens are
paid, not with ducats, but with more or less enviable hours of
love in distinguished
<span class="nowrap">boudoirs&#8221;;<a id="FNanchor311"></a><a href="#Footnote311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span>
and Victor Joze also describes
the advertisements&mdash;paid for by a night of love, or perhaps only
by a smile&mdash;which the writers of Paris give in the newspapers to
the distinguished cocottes of the Quartier Marb&#339;uf or of the
Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, in order to attract the attention
of Indian nabobs, Russian Grand Dukes, or American millionaires,
to this or that fashionable beauty. This is characteristic
of Paris. In other great capitals marketable gallantry does not
seek publicity in this way, but pursues a more hidden course.</p>

<p>For what the German, and especially what the Berliners, term<span class="pagenum" id="Page348">[348]</span>
the &#8220;half-world&#8221; is very different from the type we have just
described of the true Parisian demi-mondaine. Our half-world
(the half-world of Berlin) is recruited for the most part from
intelligent prostitutes, who are to be found chiefly in the public
gardens, in the Zoological Gardens, in the Lehrter Ausstellungspark,
and in the leading restaurants. Here <b>every evening</b> they
seek new prey, every evening they sell their charms to a new
lover for a definite sum of money; whereas the true lady of the
half-world never has at any time more than one or two admirers,
who provide for all the expenses of her life, and she never&mdash;at any
rate <b>in public</b>&mdash;practises professional prostitution, as do the
women just described.</p>

<p>Finally, there is yet another type, which must not be confused
with the demi-monde. This is the <b>international prostitute</b>, who
journeys from one place to another, has indeed often the appearance
of a distinguished lorette, but leads a much more insecure,
unstable life than the true demi-mondaine, and often combines
with prostitution the profession of an adventuress. Now she is
in Paris, now in London, now at Biarritz, now at Monte Carlo
(the principal field of her activity), now in Constantinople,
Smyrna, St. Petersburg, or Berlin. Sometimes she undertakes a
voyage of discovery to the New World. Germany provides a not
insignificant percentage of these international cocottes. Such
wanderers are especially well known in the circles of officers and
of speculators on the Bourse; by these they are not seldom
&#8220;recommended,&#8221; after the manner in which a traveller is given
letters of introduction. They may even be &#8220;raffled for,&#8221; as
recently happened in an officers&#8217; mess in Munich, and so pass to
the share of the fortunate (generally much to be commiserated)
winner. Abroad they prefer to adopt French or exotic names.</p>

That this opinion is false, I have proved incontestably as regards syphilis in

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p class="noindent">The central problem of the sexual question is, as I pointed out
at the commencement of the previous chapter, the suppression
of prostitution and of <b>venereal diseases</b>, the former evil being the
principal focus of the latter. I say the principal &#8220;<b>focus</b>,&#8221; not
the &#8220;cause.&#8221; For, if all prostitutes were <b>healthy</b>, we could leave
prostitution quietly alone&mdash;leaving out of consideration the moral
depravity to which it gives rise&mdash;and venereal diseases would
spontaneously disappear.</p>

<p>This opinion I advance at the beginning of the chapter on
venereal diseases because, even at the present day, there is a
remarkable species of <b>philosophy, or rather theology, of venereal
diseases</b>, which propounds the most extraordinary hypothesis
regarding their <b>origin</b>.</p>

<p>For example, the Alsatian writer Alexander Weill, in his confused
work &#8220;The Laws and Mysteries of Love,&#8221; writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Why should we bother our heads about the cure of syphilis? If
anyone wishes to get rid of any evil, he must first of all ascertain its
causes in order to remove these. If the cause of it is removed, the evil
disappears spontaneously. If the snake has been killed, its poison no
longer does any harm. But how can we put an end to the causes of
syphilis, when this disease is spontaneously renewed and increased day
by day by means of neglected prostitution, and by our social laws
which combine to oppose the monogamy of youth and the increase of
population? If to-day we could cure all patients suffering from
syphilis, <b>to-morrow the same disease would return in a new form, for it
would be recreated by the same irregularities that first led to its production</b> (!)
It is absolutely useless to employ iodide of potassium and
mercury, for every new infringement of natural laws would again bring
into being new incurable diseases, which can only be avoided by those
who have firmly resolved to observe these laws strictly.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Weill, indeed, goes so far as to maintain that every man who
<b>simultaneously, or rather in brief succession, has intercourse with
two healthy women, acquires syphilis</b>, even although both these
women remain faithful to him, because &#8220;<b>any kind of libertinism
in sexual intercourse suffices by itself to give rise to this disease</b>!&#8221;</p>

<p>According to this view, which is shared by many members of
the laity, venereal diseases, and, above all, the worst of them,
syphilis, would be as old as sexual licentiousness itself&mdash;that is,
<b>as old as the human race, and an inalienable associate of that
race</b>.</p>

<p>In my book on &#8220;The Origin of Syphilis&#8221; I have disproved<span class="pagenum" id="Page352">[352]</span>
this view. I have answered the question, so important alike on
general philosophical and on social-hygienic grounds, regarding
the true nature of syphilis, and have proved that syphilis (and
also the other venereal diseases) had a definite <b>local</b> and <b>temporal</b>
origin; that syphilis has not existed since the beginning of time;
and that some day, when certain definite conditions are fulfilled,
the disease will disappear.</p>

<p>The history of syphilis is a matter of profound <b>practical</b> importance.
From that history we learn with certainty that the
most dangerous and most dreaded of the venereal diseases has,
for the European world, and for the &#8220;old world&#8221; in general,
the character of a <b>pure chance comer</b>; and we learn that <b>retrospectively</b>&mdash;regarded
from the point of view of our present
experience&mdash;at the time when the disease first began to flourish,
it might perhaps have been nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to overestimate the <b>practical</b> importance of
the recognition of this fact&mdash;that for the old civilized world
syphilis represents a historical phenomenon, that it has a history,
a beginning, or, as Voltaire half-ironically remarks, a genealogy.</p>

<p>Is there not a deliverance, a redemption, in the idea that for
the old world there was a time in which syphilis did not exist;
that this time, in comparison with the time which has elapsed
since syphilis first appeared, was almost infinitely long; and that
for this reason, when we look out into the future, the history of
the lues venerea assumes the character of a simple episode in
the history of European civilized humanity?</p>

<p>At the same time, the definite acceptance of this view would
be an urgent warning to all those obscurantists of both sexes who
imagine that the problem of the diffusion of venereal diseases
can be solved exclusively by religious and moral considerations,
and who thus confuse the simplest and clearest relationships,
place everything upon an insecure foundation, and exclude every
possibility of a successful campaign against syphilis.</p>

<p>Even to-day it unfortunately happens that many continue,
as of old, to believe that sexual intercourse is a sin for which a
punishment has been provided, and that this punishment is a
venereal disease&mdash;for example, syphilis. Tylor, the celebrated
English anthropologist, has proved that this idea has developed
out of the <b>animism</b> extending back into prehistoric times, which
regarded all illnesses as the work of demons. We are still influenced
by this doctrine, this gloomy, demoniacal conception in
respect of everything sexual. I need hardly remind the reader
of the ideas of Tolstoi, and of his disciple, the unhappy Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page353">[353]</span>
Weininger, a disciple exceeding even his master in respect of
fanatical condemnation of sexual intercourse. Until recently
the laws regulating our German system of workmen&#8217;s insurance
against illness continued to exhibit definite traces of our legislators&#8217;
adhesion to this view. The majority of physicians and
historians who said that syphilis was as old as sexual intercourse
itself, who employed the phrase <i>ubi Venus ibi syphilis</i>, were unconsciously
influenced by this idea, that venereal diseases are to
be regarded as a mark of the Divine wrath.</p>

<p>This theological theory, as we may call it, of the origin of
syphilis is opposed by certain incontrovertible facts, which
suffice to show its utter nullity and untenability.</p>

<p>The mere fact that there exists a <b>blameless</b> infection with
syphilis (<i>syphilis innocentium</i>), that, for example, in certain
districts of Russia as many as 90&nbsp;% of the cases of this disease
are acquired <b>quite independently</b> of sexual intercourse, by simple
contact, shows the absurdity of this superstitious idea.</p>

<p>In the second place, it is a widely known fact that quite frequently
persons who are still entirely uncontaminated, blameless
initiates, become infected with syphilis on the very first occasion
in which they have sexual intercourse, whilst greater experience
and more exact knowledge of the threatening dangers induce
notorious debauchees to adopt effective measures of protection
(which, however, would be useless if syphilis were really a divinely
decreed punishment for licentiousness of this kind!).</p>

<p>In the third place, the occurrence of syphilis <b>in little children</b>&mdash;partly
owing to inheritance, partly, however, acquired in the way
already mentioned by casual contact&mdash;affords a striking refutation
of the above idea, which, unfortunately, still dominates and
fascinates a large circle of people.</p>

<p>We could adduce further arguments against this view, but
what we have said should suffice to show clearly the untenability
of such a superstition. The syphilis of one individual is not the
consequence of sexual intercourse, but the consequence of another
case of syphilis in another individual&mdash;that is to say, syphilis is
a <b>specific infective disease</b>, transmissible only by means of its
peculiar specific virus, and this transmission can be effected
<b>without any sexual intercourse</b>, by means of contacts of other
kinds. <b>Syphilis arises only from syphilis.</b></p>

<p>We have, therefore, to attack <b>this</b> disease precisely in the same
manner as the other venereal diseases. As a Portuguese physician
has most aptly remarked, to the tyranny of syphilis we must
oppose the tyranny of human reason. The principal aim of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page354">[354]</span>
campaign against venereal diseases will be the <b>organization</b> of
the means offered to us by reason and experience to cope with
the disease. The knowledge of these means must be diffused in
ever-wider circles of humanity, and care must be taken that every
individual is fully and clearly informed regarding the importance
and the dangers of syphilis and the other venereal diseases.</p>

<p>Here also history is our teacher, our lamp of truth, and promises
us complete success as the result of our campaign against venereal
diseases.</p>

<p>The results of my investigations regarding the origin of syphilis
all point to a <b>single</b> extremely important fact&mdash;namely, that in
the case of syphilis, and as regards the &#8220;old world,&#8221; we have
to do with a <b>specific disease of modern times</b>, which made its first
appearance <b>at the end of the fifteenth century</b>, and of the previous
existence of which, even in the most distant prehistoric times,
not the minutest trace remains. This view was held by very
eminent physicians, even before the publication of my own
critical work, based upon entirely new sources of study. Among
these authorities I may mention Jean Astruc and Christoph
Girtanner, in the eighteenth century; in the nineteenth century,
the Spanish army surgeon Montejo, and of German physicians,
above all, Rudolf Virchow, A. Geigel, von Liebermeister, C. Binz,
and P. G. Unna. The great philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer
held the same <span class="nowrap">view.<a id="FNanchor312"></a><a href="#Footnote312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Ricord, the celebrated French syphilologist, spoke once of a
romance of syphilis which still remained to be written. I should
rather compare it with a <b>drama</b>, the separate acts of which are
<b>centuries</b>. Of this drama, <b>four</b> acts have already been played.
At the present moment we find ourselves at the <b>beginning</b> of the
<b>fifth</b> act. Thus, we have an <b>entire</b> century before us, in which,
with all the powers placed at our disposal by scientific medical
research, by practical therapeutics, and by hygiene in association
with social measures, we must work to this end, that this fifth
act shall also be the <b>last</b>, as it is in the case of a proper drama.</p>

<p>The history of syphilis has remained so long obscure, because,
until the time of Philipp Ricord&mdash;<b>that is to say, until the beginning
of the second half of the nineteenth century</b>&mdash;the three venereal
diseases, <b>syphilis</b>, or <b>lues</b>, the so-called <b>soft chancre</b> (<b>venereal ulcer
or chancroid</b>), and <b>gonorrh&#339;a</b>, were regarded as essentially one
disease; whereas we know to-day that syphilis is a specific infective<span class="pagenum" id="Page355">[355]</span>
disease of a <b>constitutional</b> character, which permeates the
whole body, and must be absolutely distinguished from the other
venereal diseases, these latter being purely <b>local</b> in character.
This earlier belief in the identity of all venereal infections, an
error held even by so great an authority as John Hunter, who
was misled by falsely interpreted experiments, renders it necessary
that the historical side of the question should be considered
also from this point of view.</p>

<p>If gonorrh&#339;a and chancroid were of a syphilitic nature, then
certainly syphilis must have existed from very early times. It
would not be difficult to refer to syphilis some descriptions and
accounts of diseases of the genital organs given by the ancient
and medieval writers. It was the progressive enlightenment
regarding the essential differences between the three venereal
diseases which first proved the untenability of such opinions;
we were further assisted by the knowledge of <b>pseudo-venereal</b>
and <b>pseudo-syphilitic</b> diseases which we have obtained from
modern dermatology. Moreover, in the old world syphilitic
bones belonging to ancient or medieval times have <b>never</b> been
<span class="nowrap">discovered.<a id="FNanchor313"></a><a href="#Footnote313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>
The first syphilitic bones date from <b>after the time
of the discovery of America</b>. They appear, above all, <b>after the
outbreak of the great epidemic of syphilis which followed the
Italian campaign of King Charles VIII. of France, in the years
1494 and 1495</b>; it was then that syphilis first became diffused
in the old world.</p>

<p>In my work on &#8220;The Origin of Syphilis&#8221; (Jena,
<span class="nowrap">1901),<a id="FNanchor314"></a><a href="#Footnote314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span> I have
adduced proof, basing my views upon the criticism of older
opinions, and assisted by the utilization of very abundant new
sources of material, that syphilis was first introduced into Spain
in the years 1493 and 1494 by the crew of Columbus, who brought
it from Central America, and more especially from the island of
<b>Hayti</b>; from Spain it was carried by the army of Charles VIII.
to Italy, where it assumed an epidemic form; and after the army
was disbanded the disease was transported by the soldiers to the
other countries of Europe, and also was soon taken by the Portuguese
to the Far East, to India, China, and Japan. At the
time of its first appearance in the old world, syphilis was extraordinarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page356">[356]</span>
<b>virulent</b>. All the morbid phenomena produced by the
disease had a more rapid and violent course than at the present
day; the mortality was much higher; the consequences, even
when a cure was effected, were much more severe. This virulence
of syphilis at the time of its first introduction can only be explained,
in accordance with our modern views of the nature and
mode of appearances of the disease, by the fact that the nations
of the old world (who, <i>nota bene</i>, were <b>all</b> attacked with equal
intensity) had, until that time, been <b>completely free</b> from syphilis.
<b>All classes</b> of the people and <b>all nations</b> were visited by syphilis
to an equal extent and with the same violence.</p>

<p>Even to-day we observe everywhere, when syphilis is introduced
into regions which have hitherto been <b>free</b> from the disease,
that it has the same acute course, the same violence of morbid
manifestations, that characterized its first appearance in Europe.
In the four centuries that have elapsed since its introduction
into Europe there has occurred a gradual <b>mitigation</b> of the
syphilitic virus, or rather a certain degree of immunization of
European humanity against the disease. Speaking generally,
syphilis has to-day&mdash;in comparison with that earlier time&mdash;a
relatively mild course. To this point we shall return
<span class="nowrap">later.<a id="FNanchor315"></a><a href="#Footnote315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The two other venereal diseases, <b>gonorrh&#339;a</b> and <b>chancroid</b>,
unquestionably existed in Europe in the days of antiquity. But
they also are <b>specific infective diseases</b>, and are only produced
by the virus peculiar to each, just as syphilis has its own peculiar
virus.</p>

<p>Ricord (1800-1889), in the years 1830 to 1850, proved the complete
<b>diversity</b> of syphilis and gonorrh&#339;a, established the doctrine
of the three stages of syphilis&mdash;primary, secondary, and tertiary&mdash;and,
finally, taught us to distinguish the <b>soft, non-syphilitic
chancre</b> (<b>chancroid</b>) from the <b>hard, syphilitic chancre</b>. Virchow,
in his celebrated essay on &#8220;The Nature of Constitutional Syphilitic
Affections&#8221; (<i>Virchow&#8217;s Archiv</i>, 1858, vol. xv., p. 217 <i>et seq.</i>),
then threw a clear light on the peculiar course of constitutional
syphilis and on the causes of the occasional disappearance and
sudden reappearance of the morbid phenomena. Hitherto, however,
our knowledge of venereal diseases had rested on an extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page357">[357]</span>
insecure foundation; and <b>the truly scientific study of
the subject</b> may be said to have begun in the year 1879, with
Albert Neisser&#8217;s epoch-making discovery of the <b>gonococcus</b> as
the specific exciting cause of gonorrh&#339;a. In the years 1889 to
1892 there followed the discovery of the <b>bacillus of chancroid</b> by
Ducrey and Unna, by means of which discovery the complete
distinction between the soft and the hard chancre was definitely
proved; and, finally, the three years 1903 to 1906 were
characterized by <b>remarkable discoveries</b>, the full importance of
which is not as yet fully realized, <b>regarding the nature of the
syphilitic virus</b>. In the year 1903 Eli Metchnikoff succeeded in
transmitting syphilis from human beings to <b>apes</b>, and thus laid
the foundation for progressive research regarding syphilis by
means of experiments on animals; this was carried further by
Lassar, by the inoculation of the syphilitic virus from one ape
to another, and also by A. Neisser in his experimental researches
in <span class="nowrap">Java;<a id="FNanchor316"></a><a href="#Footnote316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span>
and in March, 1905, the Berlin protozoologist Fritz
Schaudinn, since prematurely lost to the world of science, published
his first studies on the probable exciting cause of syphilis,
the so-called &#8220;<b>spiroch&aelig;te pallida</b>.&#8221; Numerous subsequent investigations
have established the connexion between this spirilla-form,
belonging to the order of protozoa, and syphilitic disease.
In this way we have been brought notably nearer to the discovery
of the certain cure of syphilis and to the discovery of means of
immunization against the disease. In this direction quite new
views are opening before our <span class="nowrap">eyes.<a id="FNanchor317"></a><a href="#Footnote317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span>
Numerous ideas suggested
by recent discoveries in the province of syphilitic research are
described in the admirable essay by J. Jadassohn, &#8220;Contributions
to Syphilology,&#8221; published in the German &#8220;Archives for
Dermatology and Syphilis,&#8221; 1907. <i>Cf.</i> also the account of the
recent doctrines regarding syphilis by P. G. Unna and Iwan
Bloch, &#8220;Die Praxis der Hautkrankheiten,&#8221; pp. 548-592 (Vienna
and Berlin, 1908).</p>

<p>When some day humanity has been freed from the &#8220;<b>sexual
plague</b>,&#8221; from the hydra of venereal diseases, and when a monument
is erected to the liberators, four names will there be commemorated:
Ricord, Neisser, Metchnikoff, and Schaudinn!</p>

<p>After these preliminary remarks on the nature of venereal
diseases, I proceed to a short description of them, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page358">[358]</span>
begin with the most dangerous of all the venereal diseases,
<span class="nowrap"><b>syphilis</b>.<a id="FNanchor318"></a><a href="#Footnote318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The first manifestations of syphilis make their appearance
about three or four weeks <b>after</b> infection, at the place at which
infection has occurred, and this is not in every case the genital
organs. It is true that syphilis is most commonly transmitted
by means of sexual intercourse, but frequently also by contacts
of other kinds&mdash;for example, by <b>kissing</b>; by gynecological or
surgical examinations and operations; by <b>drinking from a glass</b>
which has previously been used by some one suffering from
syphilis; by the use of uncleansed pocket-handkerchiefs, towels,
and bedding, which have been used by a syphilitic patient; by
the use of tobacco-pipes, wind-instruments, tooth-brushes, tooth-picks,
a glass-blower&#8217;s mouthpiece, etc., belonging to strangers;
<b>by an uncleansed razor</b>; by the nasty habit of licking the point
of a pencil; by moistening postage-stamps with the tongue;
by sucking the wound in circumcision; <b>by the suckling of the
infant at the breast of a syphilitic wet-nurse</b>,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a id="FNanchor319"></a><a href="#Footnote319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></span> In England
the custom, when taking a judicial oath, of kissing the Bible
has repeatedly sufficed to transmit syphilitic infection.</p>

<p>In certain districts in which the level of civilization is a low
one&mdash;as, for example, in some parts of Russia and of Turkey&mdash;as
many as 50 to 60&nbsp;% of all infections occur independently of
sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>All the <b>discharges</b> from syphilitic lesions in all three stages of the
disease are infective. The infective character of the tertiary stage
of syphilis was formerly doubted, but has recently been proved
beyond dispute. <b>Blood</b> also, although more rarely, can prove
infective. On the other hand, the <b>pure</b> secretions&mdash;that is, the
physiological secretions, not contaminated by morbid products&mdash;such
as the saliva, tears, and milk, are not infective. Syphilis
is, however, very frequently transmitted by means of the <b>semen</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page359">[359]</span></p>

<p>Infection occurs in places in which there is a solution of continuity
of the skin or mucous membrane, such as a scratch or a
superficial wound, through which the virus can enter. In this
way an apparently healthy syphilitic patient&mdash;when, for example,
he gets a small abrasion on the penis (or, in the case of a woman,
in the vagina)&mdash;can transmit syphilis if the other individual also
has a similar abrasion through which infection can occur.</p>

<p>As we have said, it is not till the lapse of two to four weeks
after infection has occurred that the first manifestations of
syphilis appear, in the form of a small vesicle or nodule in the
infected area; less often merely an abraded area of a peculiar
red colour. Gradually this nodule or area enlarges, and becomes
continually <b>harder</b> at the base, whilst the surface often undergoes
ulceration, and secretes extremely infective pus (the so-called
&#8220;<b>hard chancre</b>&#8221; or &#8220;<b>primary</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>lesion</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor320"></a><a href="#Footnote320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span>).</p>

<p>This induration is in most cases a certain sign that the syphilitic
virus has already entered the body; at least, it has only been
possible in a few very rare cases, by excision or cauterization of
the hard chancre, to prevent syphilis from entering the blood.
Almost always, notwithstanding such endeavours, the manifestations
of general infection of the body soon appear.</p>

<p>From the place of infection&mdash;that is, from the place at which
the hard chancre forms&mdash;the syphilitic virus next passes by way
of the lymph-stream into the inguinal glands, so that these, in
the third or fourth week after the appearance of the hard chancre,
begin to swell and to become hard. This swelling of the inguinal
glands is painless (the so-called &#8220;<b>indolent bubo</b>&#8221;), in contrast to
the painful swelling which accompanies the soft chancre. From
this region the poison now proceeds by way of the bloodvessels
and lymph paths on its wanderings all over the body, the individual
stages of which can be detected by swellings of the lymph-glands
of the axilla, the elbow, the neck, etc. Sometimes other
symptoms of general infection are noticeable; above all, the
appearance of <b>fever</b> (never earlier than forty days after infection),
<b>pains</b> in the muscles, joints, nerves, also severe headaches,
a general feeling of <b>lassitude</b>, <b>pallor</b>, and a falling-off in the
nutritive condition.</p>

<p>These are the forerunners of the so-called <b>secondary</b> stage of
syphilis, which now manifests itself by the appearance of a
multiform <b>skin eruption</b>, rendering the diagnosis of syphilis absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page360">[360]</span>
certain. For this reason, in doubtful cases of ulceration of
the genital organs the patient should inspect his skin very carefully
every day for several weeks or months, and keep watch for the
appearance of red spots or nodules. This syphilitic eruption on
the skin is also in the later periods one of the most certain and
most characteristic insignia of the disease.</p>

<p>The eruption commonly appears first on the trunk, in the form
of rose-coloured spots (the so-called &#8220;<b>roseola syphilitica</b>&#8221;),
spreads thence over the whole body, and in many cases, simultaneously
with or shortly after the spotted eruption, <b>nodules</b>
appear on the skin, and marked thickenings form on the mucous
membranes, especially at the anus, in the mouth, and on the
tongue (the so-called &#8220;<b>plaques muqueuses</b>,&#8221; or &#8220;<b>condylomata</b>&#8221;).
The patient&#8217;s attention is spontaneously directed to these lesions
by painful sensations in the mouth or by itching of the anus.
Often it is these painful sensations, associated with a violent
inflammation of the tonsils and pharynx (the so-called &#8220;<b>angina
syphilitica</b>&#8221;), which first lead the patient to consult a doctor,
after all the earlier symptoms have passed by unnoticed! As
characteristic forms of the secondary syphilitic changes in the
skin must, therefore, be mentioned the so-called &#8220;<b>corona Veneris</b>,&#8221;
by which distinguished name is denoted an eruption on the forehead,
especially along the margin of the hair, which by members
of the laity is easily confused with other affections of the skin
common in this locality; the so-called &#8220;<b>collier de Venus</b>,&#8221; or
<b>leukoderma syphiliticum</b>, a peculiar pigmentation of the skin on
the throat and the back of the neck in the form of <b>brown</b> patches
with <b>white</b> intervening areas. This symptom, <b>which occurs
almost exclusively</b> in women, is an absolutely certain sign of
syphilis. Equally characteristic is the so-called &#8220;<b>syphilitic
psoriasis</b>,&#8221; the appearance of peculiar patches and thickenings
on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet; characteristic
also is the syphilitic <b>loss of hair</b>, by its sudden onset and by the
patchy way in which it occurs. Not rarely do we see <b>purulent</b>
eruptions on the skin in this secondary stage of syphilis.</p>

<p>The syphilitic eruption of the skin is only an external manifestation
of a disease affecting the entire body, for the internal
organs also suffer. The affection of the liver manifests itself by
jaundice; that of the brain and the meninges by headaches and
by <b>weakness of memory</b>, which is often well marked at this stage;
that of the spleen by swelling; that of the kidneys by the appearance
of albumin in the urine; that of the bones by very painful
inflammatory swellings; that of the eyes specially by the well-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page361">[361]</span>
<b>syphilitic iritis</b> (60&nbsp;% of all inflammations of
the iris are syphilitic in nature!).</p>

<p>If the disease remains untreated, the appearances just described
become more general and continually more severe; and after
some time, quite new morbid symptoms are superadded (often
as early as the third year, on the average five to ten years after
infection, but also later), resulting from the transformation of the
syphilitic morbid process into the <b>tertiary</b> stage. To these new
manifestations belong the appearance of large <b>nodules</b> in the skin
and other organs, which sooner or later undergo ulceration, the
so-called &#8220;<b>syphilitic gummata</b>&#8221;; their ulcerative destruction may
entail the greatest disfigurement or danger to life&mdash;for example,
perforation of the hard palate; sinking of the bridge of the nose
(the syphilitic &#8220;<b>saddle-nose</b>&#8221;); ulcerative destruction of large
portions of the bones of the skull, of the intestine, of the liver,
the lungs, the testicles, the bloodvessels (especially dangerous
are gummous diseases of the bloodvessels of the brain), the brain,
and the spinal cord. <b>Apoplectic strokes</b> occurring in comparatively
young persons and <b>nervous paralysis</b> of the most various
kinds, as well as sudden <b>deafness</b> and <b>blindness</b>, are in most cases
referable to syphilitic disease. Many chronic diseases of the
liver, kidneys, and nervous system, are consequences of previous
syphilis; also <b>calcification of the arteries</b>, the very dangerous
dilatation of the great bloodvessels, especially of the aorta
(aneurism of the aorta), are very often of syphilitic origin.</p>

<p>By the researches of Alfred Fournier and Wilhelm Erb, we
know to-day that two severe diseases of the central nervous
system&mdash;<b>tabes dorsalis</b> or <b>locomotor ataxy</b>, and <b>general paralysis
of the insane</b> (<b>paralytic dementia</b>)&mdash;are almost always (in about
95&nbsp;% of the cases) referable to earlier syphilis. Among 5,749
cases of syphilis encountered in his own private practice, Fournier
observed no less than 758 cases of brain syphilis, 631 cases of
tabes, and 83 cases of softening of the brain. Tabes and general
paralysis of the insane are all the more dangerous because they
are no longer, properly speaking, &#8220;syphilitic&#8221; diseases, and
therefore they cannot be cured by antisyphilitic treatment;
they are severe degenerative changes of the central nervous
system, which has been, as it were, prepared for their occurrence
by the previous syphilis. These belong to the class of the so-called
&#8220;<b>parasyphilitic</b>&#8221; diseases in which antisyphilitic treatment
has little or no good effect.</p>

<p>Even more tragic are the consequences of syphilis to the <b>family</b>,
the <b>offspring</b>, and the <b>race</b>. <b>Syphilis in married life</b>, <b>congenital<span class="pagenum" id="Page362">[362]</span>
syphilis</b>, and the <b>degeneration of the race by syphilis</b>&mdash;these are
the tragic manifestations which come under consideration in this
connexion.</p>

<p>In his admirable work on &#8220;Syphilis and Marriage,&#8221; Alfred
Fournier, the greatest living authority on syphilis in all its manifestations
and relationships, has described the momentous influence
exercised by syphilis in conjugal life; and in his recently
published work, &#8220;Syphilis a Social Danger,&#8221; he has dealt also
with congenital syphilis and racial degeneration. He found that,
on the average, among 100 women suffering from syphilis, 20 had
been infected by their husbands, either at the very commencement
of married life, or in its later course, or finally through the
offspring after conception. Divorce on the ground of syphilitic
infection by the husband is at the present day of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>The transmission of syphilis to the child by <b>inheritance</b> may
be effected either by the father or the mother; when both the
father and the mother are syphilitic, it occurs with absolute certainty.
The various possibilities of transmission, and the contingent
immunity of mother or child, as they are expressed in
Colles&#8217;s law (Baum&egrave;s&#8217;s law), and in Profeta&#8217;s law, cannot here be
further dealt with. If the mother has herself been infected with
syphilis, or if she was previously syphilitic, either the child is not
carried until term, abortion or miscarriage ensuing, or, finally, it
is born with symptoms of congenital
<span class="nowrap">syphilis.<a id="FNanchor321"></a><a href="#Footnote321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>The frequent occurrence of premature births and still-births in
any family suggests strong suspicions that they are due to syphilis.
The <b>general mortality</b> of the children in a family is regarded by
Fournier as an important sign to the physician of congenital
syphilis. Syphilitic infection of the father gives rise to a mortality
in the children of 28&nbsp;%; syphilis in the mother causes a
mortality in the children of 60&nbsp;%; when the disease affects both
parents, the mortality among the children amounts to 68&nbsp;%.
Absolutely astounding is the mortality of the children of syphilitic
prostitutes; it amounts to from 84 to 86&nbsp;%.</p>

<p>Children born <b>alive</b>, suffering from congenital syphilis, are
generally <span class="nowrap">weakly,<a id="FNanchor322"></a><a href="#Footnote322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></span>
of deficient body-weight; have often a flaccid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page363">[363]</span>
wrinkled skin, covered with typical syphilitic eruptions, and frequently
with great purulent vesicles, especially on the palms of
the hands and the soles of the feet (&#8220;pemphigus syphiliticus&#8221;);
the internal organs also, the spleen, the liver, and the bones,
exhibit morbid changes. Characteristic is the syphilitic affection
of the upper air-passages, especially the syphilitic &#8220;cold in the
head&#8221; (<b>syphilitic rhinitis</b>&mdash;&#8220;snuffles&#8221;), of new-born congenitally
syphilitic children. Congenital syphilis further gives rise to
severe <b>disturbances of development</b> and to phenomena to which
Fournier has given the name of &#8220;<b>late syphilis</b>&#8221; (&#8220;syphilis hereditaria
tarda&#8221;), because they first make their appearance in the
later years of <span class="nowrap">life.<a id="FNanchor323"></a><a href="#Footnote323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span>
Permanent <b>debility</b>, <b>arrest of development</b>,
<b>stigmata of degeneration</b>, in the form of various <b>malformations</b>&mdash;as,
for example, notching of the edge of the upper central incisor
permanent teeth (a symptom first described by Jonathan Hutchinson),
malformations of the nose, the ears, and the palate, dwarfing,
deaf-mutism, malformations of the external and internal reproductive
organs, <span class="nowrap">rickets,<a id="FNanchor324"></a><a href="#Footnote324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></span>
epilepsy, and mental weakness&mdash;are the
consequences of congenital syphilis. Tarnowsky, Fournier, and
Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my have traced the consequences of congenital syphilis
into the second and third generation, and so have discovered an
important cause of racial degeneration. Syphilis in the grandfather
can still exercise its disastrous influence in the grandson,
and give rise to the above-mentioned stigmata of
<span class="nowrap">degeneration.<a id="FNanchor325"></a><a href="#Footnote325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span>
Indeed, congenital syphilis of the second generation often appears
with the same severity as that of the first generation; and, like
acquired syphilis, congenital syphilis in women can cause a predisposition
to miscarriages and still-births.</p>

<p>According to statistics obtained by Edmond Fournier, relating
to 11,000 cases of syphilis (10,000 men, 1,000 women) from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page364">[364]</span>
private practice of his father, Alfred Fournier, regarding the age
at which infection occurs, it appears that in <b>men</b> it most commonly
occurs between the ages of twenty and twenty-six years (the
maximum number of infections during the twenty-third year); in
<b>women</b>, between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one; 8&nbsp;% of
syphilitic males and 20&nbsp;% of syphilitic females were infected
before the age of twenty years. Syphilis is to a considerable
extent at the present day a disease of <b>inexperienced youth</b>. This
fact is important in relation to the problem of prevention and
the problem of <span class="nowrap">enlightenment.<a id="FNanchor326"></a><a href="#Footnote326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Of much less importance than syphilis is the purely local <b>soft
chancre</b>, or chancroid, which never results in general infection.
Chancroid is produced by a specific exciting cause, a chain-forming
bacillus (streptobacillus), <i>Bacillus ulceris cancrosi</i>, which
is found in the pus secreted by the ulcer. <b>One or two days</b> after
infection, a small pustule forms at the site of inoculation, generally
on the external genital organs. This pustule soon bursts, and a
deeply hollowed ulcer makes its appearance, which usually undergoes
rapid increase, and frequently, owing to the infective character
of the pus, gives rise to new chancres in the neighbourhood
of the original one, so that the soft chancre is commonly multiple.
When suitably treated with antiseptic powders and cauterization,
chancroid usually heals quickly; there are, however, very dangerous
varieties of chancroid&mdash;for instance, the <b>serpiginous</b>
chancre, which continues to creep irresistibly forward; and the
<b>phaged&aelig;nic</b> or <b>gangrenous</b> chancre, which puts the skill of the
physician to the utmost test. A less dangerous but extremely
disagreeable complication of chancroid is inflammation of the
inguinal glands, most commonly only on one side; this painful
&#8220;bubo&#8221; (painful in contrast with the painless syphilitic bubo)
has a well-marked tendency to suppuration. If this occurs,
and the pus finds its way to the surface, fistulas and new chancrous
ulcers are liable to occur at the place where it opens. By rest in
bed, the inunction of iodide ointment, the application of cold
compresses, the injection into the bubo of a solution of nitrate
of silver, and the internal use of iodide of potassium, this unfortunate
course may be prevented.</p>

<p>A remarkable <b>change of views</b> has, in the course of the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page365">[365]</span>
thirty years, taken place in respect of the nature and importance
of <span class="nowrap"><b>gonorrh&#339;a</b>.<a id="FNanchor327"></a><a href="#Footnote327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span>
Whereas formerly this was regarded as a comparatively
harmless disease, we know to-day that gonorrh&#339;a in
the male, and still more in the female, gives rise to tedious dangers
and painful morbid phenomena, and is the source of unspeakable
sorrows, and of the miserable ill-health of numerous women, and
that it is the chief cause of <b>sterility</b> in both sexes.</p>

<p>Gonorrh&#339;a is principally a <b>disease of the mucous membrane</b>,
and is, in this way, distinguished from syphilis, which is a general
disorder, diffusing itself by way of the bloodvessels. In rare
cases, indeed, gonorrh&#339;a can exhibit general morbid manifestations,
the so-called <b>gonorrh&#339;al rheumatism</b>, gonorrh&#339;al affections
of the spinal cord and of the heart, and gonorrh&#339;al nervous
troubles, all of which are so rare, that for practical purposes they
can be left out of consideration.</p>

<p>The typical seat of gonorrh&#339;a is the <b>mucous membrane of the
urinary and the genital organs</b> of the male and the female; in the
male affecting <b>chiefly</b> the urinary organs, and in the female
affecting chiefly the genital organs. The cause of <b>genuine</b>
gonorrh&#339;a is always infection, the transmission from one human
being to another of the purulent inflammation produced by the
<b>gonococcus</b> discovered by Neisser in 1879. <b>Simple urethral
inflammations</b> with a purulent discharge also occur in which no
gonococci are found. These arise also from infection, but their
actual exciting cause has not yet been discovered. Not less
obscure is the relationship of many of the irritants giving rise to
simple urethral catarrh&mdash;for example, that which is active during
menstruation&mdash;to the supposed exciting cause. In any case,
these simple catarrhs have a very mild course, and undergo a cure
after a few days or weeks, spontaneously or as a result of treatment
with mild injections.</p>

<p>Quite otherwise is it with genuine gonorrh&#339;a. In the male it
begins from two to six days after the infective intercourse, with
a burning sensation on passing water, itching at the urethral
orifice, which very easily becomes reddened, and this is soon
followed by the discharge, either spontaneously or as a result of
pressure on the urethra, of a thick fluid, at first mucous, later
purulent, and then of a yellow or a greenish colour. Inflammation,
discharge, and pain, the latter especially in association with
urination, increase during the subsequent weeks; in addition, in
a good many cases there are slight fever, lassitude, and mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page366">[366]</span>
depression, and the patient is tormented, especially during the
night, by violent, painful erections. In exceptional cases there
are h&aelig;morrhages from the urethra (the so-called &#8220;<b>Russian clap</b>&#8221;).
In some cases the disease terminates favourably; this is especially
observed after the first attack of gonorrh&#339;a. As early as the
third week the above symptoms become less severe, and in the
fourth or sixth week after infection the whole morbid process
may come to an end, the discharge ceases, the urine becomes
clear once more, and, in fact, definite cure of the gonorrh&#339;a
ensues.</p>

<p>But the number of those who are so fortunate is comparatively
small. In the majority of cases, there are other morbid phenomena
and complications; the gonorrh&#339;a becomes &#8220;<b>subacute</b>,&#8221;
and later &#8220;<b>chronic</b>.&#8221; Ricord wrote many years ago: &#8220;When
anyone has once acquired gonorrh&#339;a, God only knows when he
will get well again!&#8221; Happily, this pessimism is no longer fully
justified at the present day; but it is a fact that in the majority
of cases <b>even to-day</b> gonorrh&#339;a is a very obstinate, wearisome
illness, a long-continued burden, not only for the patient, but
also for the doctor. The gonococci proliferate in the deeper
layers of the mucous membrane, and pass upwards into the
<b>posterior</b> part of the urethra, this latter migration being manifested
especially by frequent and painful <b>strangury</b>; further, the
<b>bladder</b>, the <b>prostate gland</b>, and the <b>epididymis</b> may be attacked.
Bilateral epididymitis has often serious consequences as regards
the procreative capacity. In about 50&nbsp;% of the cases incapacity
for fertilization (impotentia generandi) has resulted.</p>

<p>If the gonorrh&#339;a becomes chronic, thickenings occur in isolated
portions of the urethral mucous membrane; the urine remains
turbid for a long time; the discharge, it is true, becomes scantier,
but shows itself with the most annoying persistency every morning
as soon as the patient leaves his bed, in the form of the so-called
<b>&#8220;bon jour&#8221; drops</b> in the meatus; there are also troubles
connected with the prostate (painful sensations, especially during
def&aelig;cation), and symptoms of stricture of the urethra may occur.
Very often, also, relative impotence and severe sexual neurasthenia
are observed, as consequences of chronic gonorrh&#339;a.
Worst of all is the <b>long duration of the infectivity</b>. There is
always the danger that somewhere or other some gonococci may
remain hidden, and, given an opportunity, may start the process
all over again, or may transmit the infection to another person.
Zweifel reports a case in which a man actually infected a woman
thirteen years after he had first acquired gonorrh&#339;a!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page367">[367]</span></p>

<p>The infection of a woman with gonorrh&#339;a, as we know to-day,
is a disaster. It is the immortal service of the German-American
physician Noeggerath that, in the year 1872, he proved that the
majority of the stubborn &#8220;<b>diseases of women</b>&#8221; were nothing
more than the consequences of gonorrh&#339;al infection. Gonorrh&#339;a
selects by preference the internal reproductive organs of woman;
upon the extensive mucous membranes of these organs the gonococci
find the most favourable conditions for their persistent life;
they find a thousand out-of-the-way comers and hiding-places,
where they can elude the therapeutic activity of the physician.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;They grow luxuriantly, like a weed which it has not been possible
to uproot, over the entire surface of the genital mucous membrane,
attacking with the same vigour the mucous membrane of the uterus
and that of the Fallopian tubes. In women, as in men, they induce
ulceration, they cause adhesions, and they give rise to sterility.
But in the case of women, something further must be added&mdash;that,
namely, this disease has upon them a miserably depressing effect, and
that, in contradistinction from men, they are likely to suffer for many
years from intense pains. Whenever they execute certain bodily
movements, it may be during ten years in succession, they experience
pains, often horribly severe, and in most cases they are condemned to a
life of deprivation and misery&mdash;not usually for any fault of their own,
since most women are infected by their husbands&#8221; (Zweifel).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Gonorrh&#339;a in women, attacking successively the vagina, the
uterus, the Fallopian tubes, the ovaries, and the peritoneum, is
a true martyrdom, a hell upon earth. Sick in body and in mind,
these unhappy women drag out a miserable existence; and to
them so often the last consolation, that of motherhood, is denied,
for gonorrh&#339;a is the most frequent cause of sterility in woman.</p>

<p>Patients infected with gonorrh&#339;a further run the danger of
<b>blindness</b>, by transference of the gonorrh&#339;al virus to the <b>eye</b>.
This is one of the most distressing of the possible results of the
disease. New-born children whose mothers are infected with
gonorrh&#339;a are during birth exposed to the same danger of eye
infection, as they pass down the genital passage. In earlier
days a very large proportion of the blind were persons who had
lost their sight in this way very shortly after birth. Since Cr&eacute;d&eacute;
advocated the admirable method of introducing nitrate of silver
solution into the conjunctival sacs of new-born children, gonorrh&#339;al
inflammation of the eye has become one of the greatest
rarities.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX<br />
VENEREAL DISEASES IN THE HOMOSEXUAL</h3>

<p>It is an old belief, shared by the homosexual themselves, that
venereal infections are extremely rare among them. If male
homosexual persons had sexual intercourse <b>only with one another</b>,
this assumption would be in some degree plausible. For the
principal focus of venereal infection is feminine prostitution, by
which venereal diseases are transmitted to heterosexual men.
But since these homosexual men often undertake sexual acts with
heterosexual men&mdash;apart from occasional sexual intercourse with
women&mdash;a priori there is a possibility of infection in their case,
and such infection is, in fact, observed. Above all, many male
prostitutes also indulge in intercourse with women, and thus
diffuse venereal troubles among homosexual men.</p>

<p>It is obvious that <b>syphilis</b> can be diffused among the homosexual
as easily as among the heterosexual, for syphilis is transmitted
by many varieties of contact&mdash;by kisses, other caresses, etc.
But how is it as regards <b>gonorrh&#339;a</b>?</p>

<p>In the case of heterosexual men and women gonorrh&#339;a is almost
exclusively transmitted by the sexual act, by the introduction of
the male penis into the female vagina. The analogous act between
men&mdash;that is to say, p&aelig;derasty, <i>immissio penis in anum</i>&mdash;is
unquestionably far <b>rarer</b> than the ordinary sexual act between
men and women; it is commonly replaced by mutual onanism,
by kisses and other caresses, and quite frequently by <i>coitus in os</i>.
This last is much commoner than genuine p&aelig;dication. Of gonorrh&#339;a
of the rectum produced by p&aelig;dication when the active man
is suffering from gonorrh&#339;a, we very rarely hear. But is there,
in the case of homosexual men, any possibility of gonorrh&#339;al
infection due to <i>coitus in os</i>?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that typical <b>gonorrh&#339;a of the mouth</b>
occurs. The observations of Kuttler, Atkinson, Rosinski, Dohrn,
and Kast, have proved <span class="nowrap">it.<a id="FNanchor328"></a><a href="#Footnote328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span>
Horand and Cazenave have even
observed gonorrh&#339;al infection of the urethra as a result of oral
<span class="nowrap">coitus!<a id="FNanchor329"></a><a href="#Footnote329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span>
A homosexual patient told me that some years before,
after <i>coitus in os</i> with a man, he had for several weeks had a discharge
from the urethra, which spontaneously ceased, and therefore
cannot have been genuine gonorrh&#339;a, but only urethritis<span class="pagenum" id="Page369">[369]</span>
resulting from infection by contagious angina. In the case in
question, the urethral catarrh was certainly due to the <i>coitus in
os</i>, since any other sources of infection could be excluded.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in a second case an apparently <b>gonorrh&#339;al
infection of the oral cavity</b> was transmitted from the urethra.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A homosexual man, forty-five years of age, one day allowed a
<b>heterosexual</b> man to perform <i>coitus in os</i> on him. Some days afterwards
he experienced difficulty in swallowing, was feverish, and saw in
the looking-glass that the uvula was swollen. A specialist for throat
troubles diagnosed merely a catarrhal infection. The illness became
worse, and a second throat specialist detected the presence of a purulent
angina of both tonsils, ordered painting with argentamin, also vapour
baths, and an astringent gargle, whereupon the affection gradually subsided.
Six weeks later the patient had swelling and pain in the joints
of the right knee and foot; under cold compresses these swellings subsided
after a fortnight. Of the whole trouble nothing now remains.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This description, on the part of a patient who is thoroughly
trustworthy, aroused strong suspicion of a <b>gonorrh&#339;al angina</b>,
with a consecutive gonorrh&#339;al arthritis. Unfortunately, the
purulent discharge from the tonsils was not examined for gonococci
by either of the physicians in attendance. The case remains,
anyhow, very remarkable.</p>

<p>In the case of homosexual women, it is obvious that syphilis,
and also gonorrh&#339;a, can be transmitted, the latter by mutual
friction of the genital organs. I do not know what actually
occurs in practice.</p>

At a meeting of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d&#8217;Anthropologie de Paris, held on April 19,
1906, I read a paper on &#8220;La Syphilis Pr&eacute;tendue Pr&eacute;historique,&#8221; in which I
discussed this question. The important question of ancient bones is further
considered in the second volume of my work on &#8220;The Origin of Syphilis,&#8221; pp. 317-364

Regarding the gradual acquirement (by means of natural selection) of
immunity to epidemic diseases, the works of Archdall Reid may be most profitably
consulted (&#8220;The Present Evolution of Man,&#8221; London, 1896; &#8220;The Principles
of Heredity,&#8221; London, 1905). Dr. Reid&#8217;s views on the part played in
human history by the transference of diseases from immunized to non-immunized
races are of especial interest. Unfortunately, as regards syphilis, he accepts
Hirsch&#8217;s erroneous statements relative to the antiquity of that disease, and its
origin in the eastern hemisphere (see also <a href="#Page384">p. 384</a>,

I must not omit allusion to some recent admirable works on venereal
diseases: A. Blaschko, &#8220;Venereal Diseases&#8221;&mdash;a popular exposition&mdash;(Berlin,
1904); Paul Zweifel, &#8220;Venereal Diseases and their Importance to Health&#8221;
(Leipzig, 1902); Alfred Fournier, &#8220;Syphilis a Social Danger&#8221;; Karl Ries,

Diseases&#8221; (Leipzig, 1905); Waldvogel, &#8220;The Dangers of Venereal Diseases and
their Prevention&#8221; (Stuttgart, 1905). In view of the large number of popular
works on venereal diseases, those without professional knowledge should confine
themselves to the best names, because in this province trashy literature is extraordinarily
abundant, and by the false and erroneous views it diffuses, it does
much more harm than good. The writings mentioned in this note I am able to
recommend as thoroughly scientific and <b>trustworthy</b>.</p>

It is true that such a hardening may also occur in other non-syphilitic
affections of the genital organs&mdash;for example, when they are peculiarly situated
or as a result of cauterization. Only the physician can determine whether in
such a case syphilitic infection has actually occurred.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote321"></a><a id="Footnote322"></a><a href="#FNanchor321"><span class="label">[321, 322]</span></a>
&nbsp;According to English experience, the congenitally syphilitic child rarely
exhibits any sign of syphilis when born. Thus, Hutchinson writes (&#8220;Syphilis,&#8221;
p. 73): &#8220;At the time of birth, the congenitally syphilitic infant almost invariably
has a clear skin, and appears to be in perfect health.&#8221; According to Osler also
(&#8220;Medicine,&#8221; sixth edition, p. 269): &#8220;The child may be born healthy-looking
or with well-marked evidence of the disease. In the majority of instances the
former is the case, and within the first month or two the signs of the disease
appear.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote323"></a><a href="#FNanchor323"><span class="label">[323]</span></a>
<i>Cf.</i> the recently published admirable work of Edmond Fournier, &#8220;Recherches
et Diagnostic de l&#8217;H&eacute;r&eacute;do-Syphilis Tardive&#8221; (Paris, 1907).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote324"></a><a href="#FNanchor324"><span class="label">[324]</span></a>
Parrot regarded rickets as a manifestation of congenital syphilis, but this
view has never found acceptance in England. Hutchinson remarks (&#8220;Syphilis,&#8221;
p. 408): &#8220;The typical forms of rickets are constantly met with in conditions which
do not lend the slightest support to the suggestion of syphilis.&#8221; As Cheadle
remarks: &#8220;Syphilis modifies rickets; it does not create it.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote325"></a><a href="#FNanchor325"><span class="label">[325]</span></a>
This view must be accepted with reserve. See, for instance, Osler&#8217;s
&#8220;Medicine,&#8221; sixth edition, p. 271: &#8220;Is syphilis transmitted to the third generation?
The general opinion is opposed to this view. Occasionally, however,
cases of pronounced congenital syphilis are met with in the children of parents
who are perfectly healthy, and who have not, so far as is known, had syphilis,
and yet, as remarked by Coutts, who reported such a group of cases, they do not
bear careful scrutiny. The existing difference of opinion is well illustrated in
the account by G. Boeck (<i>Berl. Klin. Wochenschrift</i>, September 12, 1904) of
four instances of hereditary lues in the second generation, while in the same
journal Jonathan Hutchinson expresses his belief that syphilis is not transmitted
to the third generation.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote326"></a><a href="#FNanchor326"><span class="label">[326]</span></a>
As more important scientific works on syphilis I must mention that of
Isidor Neumann (Vienna, 1899, second edition), containing the entire bibliography
of the subject; that of Joseph Lang (Wiesbaden, 1896, second edition);
but, above all, the epoch-making work of Alfred Fournier, &#8220;Trait&eacute; de Syphilis&#8221;

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p class="noindent">The motto which I have placed at the head of this chapter on
the campaign against venereal diseases and on the attempt to
suppress them is taken from an interesting academic essay by
the former professor of medicine at G&ouml;ttingen, K. F. H. Marx,
who is well known to have been the physician of Heinrich Heine
during the latter&#8217;s student life in G&ouml;ttingen. The title of this
essay is &#8220;The Diminution of Diseases in Consequence of Advancing
Civilization,&#8221; p. 35 (G&ouml;ttingen, 1844).</p>

<p>The hopeful view which is here expressed by the university
professor regarding the ultimate eradication of venereal diseases
was shared at that time by the eminently <b>practical physician</b>
Parent-Duchatelet. He appeals, unfortunately, not to medical
men and students of social hygiene, but to the police:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Pursue without cessation the diseases which are diffused by means
of prostitutes; <b>take it as your goal to cause them to disappear from the
list of human troubles; do not doubt that your labours will ultimately
be crowned with success, although the task may be one that will occupy
several</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>generations</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor331"></a><a href="#Footnote331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Two complete generations had, however, to pass away before
<b>the campaign against venereal diseases and the attempt to suppress
them became a burning question of the time</b>, became a question
of <b>public health</b> and social hygiene, like those which concern the
fight with tuberculosis, with infant mortality, and with alcoholism.
Once again I must repeat that the <b>organized systematic
campaign against venereal diseases is still in its very earliest
stages</b>. Strictly speaking, it dates only from seven years ago,
when the <b>first international congress for the prophylaxis of syphilis
and other venereal diseases</b> was held in Brussels, from September 4
to 8, 1899. Almost all the civilized countries, European and
other, took part in this congress, and not only physicians and
dermatologists, but also lawyers, clergymen, attach&eacute;s of embassies,
authors, and philanthropists, explained their views, and thereby
showed that the question of the suppression of venereal diseases
was one of equal interest to all classes of society, and one which
must exercise the activity of the community at large. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page374">[374]</span>
conclusion of this first international conference in 1899, there
was founded the <b>International Society for the Sanitary and
Moral Prophylaxis of Syphilis and other Venereal Diseases</b>,
which has its seat in Brussels, and meets at periodical intervals
for international conferences.</p>

<p>Especially in Germany has this organization aroused active
interest, and it was soon decided to found a national <b>German
Society for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases</b>, whose first
meeting was held on October 19, 1903, in the hall of the Berlin
Rathaus. The meeting was opened by a speech from Albert
Neisser, after which Alfred Blaschko spoke on &#8220;The Diffusion of
Venereal Diseases,&#8221; Edmund Lesser on &#8220;The Dangers of Venereal
Diseases,&#8221; Martin Kirchner on &#8220;The Social Importance of
Venereal Diseases,&#8221; and Albert Neisser on &#8220;The Aims of the
German Society for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases.&#8221; The
<b>committee</b> of the Society consists of Messrs. A. Neisser, president;
E. Lesser, vice-president and treasurer; and A. Blaschko, general
secretary. The organ of the Society is issued six times yearly,
under the title, <i>Reports of the German Society for the Suppression
of Venereal Diseases</i>, and has been published for the last four
years; it is supplied gratis to members; to non-members the
yearly subscription is only three marks. In the spring of the
year 1903 there was founded a larger <i>Journal for the Suppression
of Venereal Diseases</i>, of which five volumes have hitherto appeared;
this serves for the publication of more comprehensive
critical studies.</p>

<p>Still in the same year, 1902, there were formed the first <b>branches</b>
and <b>local groups</b> of the German Society for the Suppression of
Venereal Diseases in Hanover, Wiesbaden, Breslau, and Berlin.
Subsequently other branches were formed in Mannheim, Munich,
Cologne, Beuthen, Danzig, Stettin, Posen, Dortmund, Elberfeld,
Frankfurt-on-the-Main, G&ouml;rlitz, Hamburg, K&ouml;nigsberg, N&uuml;rnberg,
Stuttgart, and Heidelberg.</p>

<p>During the last four years, by means of lectures, the circulation
of pamphlets and leaflets, and by public discussions, information
regarding the dangers of venereal diseases has been diffused among
the widest circles of the population. Of the other activities and
measures of the Society we shall have to speak later.</p>

<p>We pass on to the consideration of the principal elements of
the modern campaign against venereal diseases. In view of the
limits of this work our discussion of this question must necessarily
be a brief one. The eradication of venereal diseases must be
effected in a <b>threefold</b> manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page375">[375]</span></p>

<p>1. By measures of <b>personal prophylaxis</b> against infection.</p>

<p>2. By the proper <b>medical treatment</b> of all cases of venereal
disease.</p>

<p>3. By measures belonging to the province of <b>public hygiene</b>, to
that of <b>state action</b>, and to that of <b>education</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>personal prophylaxis</b> of venereal
<span class="nowrap">diseases<a id="FNanchor332"></a><a href="#Footnote332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span> has made great
progress with the increasing scientific knowledge of the causes
and modes of infection of these diseases. We know now precisely
where and how we can lay down <b>personal</b> rules which give us at
least a <b>fairly secure guarantee</b> that in an individual case venereal
infection will not occur. Various points of view must then be
taken into consideration, the combined influence of which will
alone promise a successful result. No one single measure will
suffice to gain this end.</p>

<p>Above all, in this department of the prophylaxis of venereal
diseases, experienced physicians, alike of earlier and more recent
times, will unanimously agree in this proposition, that the principal
preliminary means for the avoidance of venereal infection,
means which it is absolutely essential to employ in every instance,
consist of <b>perfect cleanliness</b> on both sides. He who insists on
the most scrupulous cleanliness of body, clothing, and underclothing,
will be sure to get rid <b>immediately</b> of any uncleanliness
acquired in sexual intercourse. Cleanliness and health are often
(not always) identical. In any case, the <b>greatest mistrust</b> should
be felt as regards a person evidently unclean, with a neglected
exterior, for this is always a sign that such a person is not particular
as regards choice in matters of sexual intercourse. &#8220;<b>Germany,
get into your bath!</b>&#8221; Heinrich Laube once exclaimed. This
would be a good device to adopt in the campaign against venereal
diseases. Every uncleanliness is an irritant; it impairs the intactness
of the skin; and especially is this true of any uncleanliness
of the genital organs, and above all of the male genital organs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page376">[376]</span>
where, under the foreskin, the &#8220;smegma&#8221; (the sebaceous secretion
of the preputial glands) often undergoes decomposition, and
gives rise to an inflammation, the so-called <b>balanitis</b>, which
greatly favours the probability of
<span class="nowrap">infection.<a id="FNanchor333"></a><a href="#Footnote333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>If the foreskin has been removed by circumcision, this secretion
entirely ceases, and the mucous membrane covering the glans
penis is transformed into a thick skin, which is much less readily
affected by the causes of infection. There is no doubt that circumcision
is to a certain extent a protective measure against
syphilitic infection, whilst it does not in any way protect against
gonorrh&#339;a. Neust&auml;tter has recently collected some very remarkable
facts relating to this <span class="nowrap">question.<a id="FNanchor334"></a><a href="#Footnote334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Breitenstein has contrasted 15,000 indigenous <b>circumcised</b>
soldiers with 18,000 <b>uncircumcised</b> European soldiers of the army
of the Dutch Indies, living under similar local and hygienic conditions.
Thus, in the year 1895 there were infected with venereal
diseases, of the circumcised 16&nbsp;%, of the uncircumcised 41&nbsp;%.
As regards infections with syphilis, of the circumcised 0&middot;8&nbsp;% were
infected; of the uncircumcised, on the other hand, 4&middot;1&nbsp;%&mdash;that
is, five times as many. Similar observations were made by the
celebrated English syphilologist Jonathan Hutchinson, one of
the most ardent advocates of the general introduction of circumcision
as a protective measure against venereal, and above all
against syphilitic, infection. Moreover, with regard to the
observations made in Java, the difference did not depend upon
race, because similar differences have been observed as regards
comparative immunity from infection in respect of circumcised
Christians, circumcised on account of phimosis and other troubles,
whose number is by no means insignificant.</p>

<p>Since, however, it is unlikely that circumcision will come into
general use in Europe as a prophylactic measure, it only remains
to recommend that, as a fundamental procedure, the greatest
possible care should be employed in the daily and delicate cleansing
of the preputial sac. By this means inflammation and laceration
of these parts will be most effectually prevented, and even
without circumcision a certain resisting power will be induced.
For washing this region, lukewarm water which has been boiled
and cooled may best be employed; then dry the part carefully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page377">[377]</span>
so as not to rub off the skin. In the case of women, frequent
washings of the external genital organs, and vaginal douches,
are also of great importance in regard to the prevention of venereal
infection. <b>Before</b> and <b>after</b> the sexual act, these measures are of
especial value, because <b>often by simple mechanical means</b>, infective
material already deposited may be carried away. The same
purpose is subserved by urination, a procedure certainly adapted
for washing out gonorrh&#339;al pus which has found its way into the
urethra, before the gonococci have had time to establish themselves
in the mucous membrane. I know a number of patients
who <b>use no other means of protection in sexual intercourse beyond
the observation of extreme cleanliness, by washing and douching,
in both sexes</b>, before and after sexual intercourse, and by passing
water immediately after intercourse, and thus have remained
free from infection; but who promptly became infected <b>as soon
as they discontinued these simple measures</b>.</p>

<p>For this reason, these measures, where possible with the assistance
of <b>soap</b>, which certainly exercises some antiseptic influence,
cannot be too warmly recommended, although they naturally
<b>do not offer any absolute security</b>. They have, however, the
advantage that, in the first place, they can always be employed,
even when the true protective measures of which we speak below
are not available, and that, in the second place, they can always
be used in addition to these. It sounds, perhaps, somewhat
absurd, and yet it is true, to say that <b>washing</b> and <b>urination</b> are
the <b>first</b> and <b>most important</b> protective measures against sexual
infection.</p>

<p>The second point, which must also be considered important in
this connexion, is the <b>exercise of self-command</b> before and during
the sexual act, as far as this is possible in view of the nature of
sexual excitement, which always lessens the personal responsibility,
and overcomes reason and understanding. Yet no one
should have sexual intercourse when <b>in a state of alcoholic intoxication</b>,
in which self-control is <b>completely</b> lost; as we have
shown in an earlier passage (<a href="#Page292">pp. 292</a>-<a href="#Page296">296</a>), there are several reasons
why intercourse is apt to be disastrous to a drunken man. Moreover,
<b>love</b> prefers the dark, but <b>precaution</b> prefers <b>the sunlight</b>.
Before having intercourse with a woman previously unknown to
him, a man should inspect her in clear daylight, with a view to
her state of health. Suspicious spots on the skin, especially on
the forehead and on the trunk; white areas on the lips, the
tongue, the throat, and the back of the neck; visible glandular
swellings; a marked discharge from the genital organs; ulcerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page378">[378]</span>
areas in this region, etc., are of an extremely suspicious nature,
and should cause abstinence from intercourse. French physicians
go so far as to recommend examination of the inguinal and
cervical glands under the harmless form of pretended caresses;
but persons without medical education would seldom be sufficiently
skilled to be able to detect glandular swellings unless
these were unusually well developed. Especially enlargement
of the cervical glands&mdash;this &#8220;pulse of syphilis,&#8221; as Alfred Fournier
terms it&mdash;is a comparatively certain indication of syphilis.</p>

<p>It is dangerous also in many cases to repeat the sexual act <b>several
times</b> in brief succession, because old experience has taught us
that infective material may first make its appearance at the
second or third act of coitus, and thus infect then only. This
affords an explanation also of a fact often observed&mdash;that in
intercourse with an infected woman on the part of two healthy
men, with but a brief interval between the acts, the one who had
intercourse first often remains healthy, whilst the second is
infected.</p>

<p>I pass on to consider the <b>special protective measures</b> which
have long been recommended for the prophylaxis of venereal
infection.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Condom.</b>&mdash;This is the <b>oldest</b> and even to-day beyond
question the best and <b>most trustworthy</b> artificial protective
measure. Employed long ago in the days of antiquity, it was
in the sixteenth century once more recommended by the Italian
physician Fallopius, and therefore is not the invention of a physician
&#8220;Conton,&#8221; after whom it is said to have been named (perhaps
the name is connected with that of the French town &#8220;Condom&#8221;).
Hans Ferdy (A. Meyerhof) suggests that the word is derived
from &#8220;condus&#8221;&mdash;that is, one who <b>preserves</b> or protects&mdash;and
that the article should properly be called &#8220;condus&#8221; instead of
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;condom.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor335"></a><a href="#Footnote335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>The condom is a protective membrane, with which the penis
is covered before intercourse. We distinguish as &#8220;<b>rubber condoms</b>&#8221;
those made of rubber, gutta-percha, or caoutchouc; and
as &#8220;<b>c&aelig;cal condoms</b>&#8221; those made out of the c&aelig;cal mucous membrane
of the goat or sheep (incorrectly termed also &#8220;isinglass
condoms&#8221;). The c&aelig;cal condom is thinner and more delicate,
and blunts sensation less, than the rubber condom. The rubber
condom, however, is more <b>trustworthy</b>, in respect of durability
and its slighter liability to laceration, if the little precaution is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page379">[379]</span>
neglected to keep it in a cool place, and to protect it from the
long-continued influence of warmth. The habit of carrying about
a rubber condom in the pocket for a long time favours its rapidly
becoming untrustworthy and easily torn. C&aelig;cal condoms, on
the other hand, very readily become fragile and pervious, although
the contrary is the common opinion, and they are preferred to
rubber condoms in the belief that the dearer article must be the
better. Advertisement is exceedingly active in this direction,
and every kind of speciality is widely recommended. In England
condoms are sometimes sold bearing the portrait of some
celebrated person!</p>

<p>The condom is a &#8220;<b>general protective measure</b>&#8221;&mdash;that is, it
protects against both gonorrh&#339;a and syphilis, in so far as the
latter disease, as is usually the case, is transmitted from the
genital organs. All the leading physicians engaged more especially
in the treatment of venereal diseases are agreed that the
condom, when of good quality, when properly applied, and when
removed with care (for in the removal material adhering to the
outer surface may very readily give rise to infection), constitutes
the <b>very best</b> and <b>most certain</b> of all the protective measures
hitherto advocated. It is true that it can be used by men only,
but when used by the man it simultaneously protects the woman
from gonorrh&#339;al infection, and not rarely also from syphilitic
infection.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Instillation of Solutions of Silver</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>Salts.</b><a id="FNanchor336"></a><a href="#Footnote336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span>&mdash;These serve
exclusively for the prophylaxis of gonorrh&#339;a, and are not, therefore,
general protective measures. We owe their introduction to
Blokusewski, who recommended the use of a <b>two % solution of
nitrate of silver</b>. More recently, the albuminates of silver have
been preferred, such as <b>protargol</b> in a 10 to 20&nbsp;% solution, <b>albargin</b>
in a 4 to 10&nbsp;% solution, or a solution of 20&nbsp;% protargol-gelatine.
These solutions can be carried about in small drop-bottles&mdash;for
example, as the &#8220;Sanitas&#8221; (silver nitrate) of Blokusewski, the
&#8220;Viro&#8221; or the &#8220;Phallokos&#8221; apparatus (these are trade names
for proprietary preparations&mdash;solutions of protargol). All solutions
of silver salts must be kept in the dark, and after the lapse
of any considerable time, some freshly prepared solution must be
introduced, for time and the influence of light destroy their
efficacy. Immediately after intercourse and urination, one or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page380">[380]</span>
drops of the solution are instilled into the urethra, and a drop or
two also allowed to run over the fr&aelig;num
<span class="nowrap">pr&aelig;putii.<a id="FNanchor337"></a><a href="#Footnote337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The views regarding the value of these protective measures are
conflicting. Beyond question, they are less trustworthy than the
condom. Infection has been observed in spite of the use of
instillations. Above all, however, the continued use of these
methods gives rise to disagreeable <b>irritative manifestations</b> in the
urethra and may even cause <b>catarrhal inflammation</b>, and thus
artificially increase the liability to infection. Hence, these instillations
should be reserved for <b>occasional</b> use; <b>habitually</b>, only the
condom should be employed.</p>

<p>3. <b>Inunction.</b>&mdash;Whereas the instillation of chemical solutions
serves to protect against gonorrh&#339;a only, the practice recommended
for a much longer time of <b>anointing</b> the penis with a
simple fatty material, or with an antiseptic ointment, <b>before</b> or
<b>after</b> sexual intercourse, protects against syphilis only. It is
obvious that a layer of fatty material covering the penis exercises
the purely mechanical function of preventing the passage of
infective matters to the skin. It is, however, equally obvious
that by the to-and-fro friction during sexual intercourse, especially
when this occupies a considerable time, this fatty covering
will be rubbed away, so that the virus can find a means of entrance.
The protection is thus extremely relative. Still, such authors as
Neisser, Max Joseph, Loeb, and Campagnolle, report favourable
experiences regarding the prevention of syphilis by the inunction
of the penis, for which purpose simple vaseline, or Schleich&#8217;s wax-soap
cream, which is sold with the &#8220;Viro&#8221; apparatus, may be
employed. In any case, this method is better than nothing at
all. He who has no other protective measure available should
remember that in every house there is always some fat or ointment
obtainable which can be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>In order, whilst using this method, to protect simultaneously
against gonorrh&#339;a, it has been recommended that antiseptic ointment
should be inserted into the urethra before intercourse, but
this is a very unsatisfactory and untrustworthy method.</p>

<p>Well worth attention is the inunction recently recommended
by <span class="nowrap">Metchnikoff<a id="FNanchor338"></a><a href="#Footnote338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span>
of <b>a specific mercurial ointment</b>, after intercourse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page381">[381]</span>
for the destruction of any syphilitic virus which may have been
<span class="nowrap">deposited.<a id="FNanchor339"></a><a href="#Footnote339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span>
He used for this purpose, not the strongly irritant
blue ointment, but the <b>white precipitate ointment</b>, an ointment
of the <b>salicyl-arseniate of mercury</b> (<b>enesol</b>), and, above all, a
<b>30&nbsp;% calomel ointment</b>. After any suspicious coitus, this ointment
should be rubbed for four or five minutes into the area of possible
infection; this should be done without delay; but even after the
lapse of eighteen to twenty-four hours an effect has been traced.
The experiments on apes inoculated with syphilis gave positive
results; also in the case of a student of medicine who voluntarily
offered himself for inoculation with the syphilitic virus, the inunction
of calomel ointment appears to have prevented the outbreak
of the disease.</p>

<p><b>In any case, these new methods for the prophylaxis of syphilis
demand the most careful attention.</b> Further experience is needed
to determine whether they deserve general application.</p>

<p>4. <b>Antiseptic Washes.</b>&mdash;Washing of the penis and douching of the
vagina with antiseptic lotions (sublimate, lysol, permanganate of
potassium) after intercourse are among the most uncertain of
protective measures, because the sublimate solution, or whatever
may be used, does not find its way into any possible lacerations;
and because, in consequence of the profuse secretion of the
sebaceous glands of the male and female genital organs, these
organs are covered with a layer of fatty material, which prevents
the contact of watery fluids, but does not in the same degree
prevent the entrance of the syphilitic poison. Antiseptic washes
<b>after</b> the sexual act have as little value as the same used before
the sexual act.</p>

<p>The knowledge of these protective measures&mdash;above all, of those
named under the first, second, and third headings&mdash;ought to be
very much more general than it is. Unfortunately, however, in
public life such measures are still viewed largely from the standpoint
of the moralist as &#8220;<b>indecent</b>&#8221; or &#8220;<b>improper</b>&#8221;; and the
criminal law classifies them thus, so that their <b>public recommendation</b>
and diffusion is still exposed to great hindrances.</p>

<p>At the second congress of the Society for the Suppression of
Venereal Diseases, held in Munich in March, 1905, the question
of the public recommendation of protective measures was opened
to discussion, and was dealt with in two admirable addresses by<span class="pagenum" id="Page382">[382]</span>
O. <span class="nowrap">Neust&auml;tter<a id="FNanchor340"></a><a href="#Footnote340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
and Georg <span class="nowrap">Bernhard.<a id="FNanchor341"></a><a href="#Footnote341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span>
Bernhard proposed that
to Section 184, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, which declares
it to be a punishable offence to &#8220;expose for sale articles intended
for an indecent use, or to recommend or sell such articles to
the public,&#8221; should be added a <b>legal definition</b> in the following
sense: <b>articles which are used either to prevent venereal diseases
or to prevent conception are not regarded as &#8220;intended for an
indecent use&#8221;</b>; and Neust&auml;tter pleaded for an <b>alteration of the
existing state of the law</b>, in the sense that <b>the public recommendation
of means for the prevention and cure of venereal diseases</b>
should be legally permissible, being restricted merely by certain
<b>regulations against quackery, extortion, and other misuse</b>. The
regulation of the recommendation could best <b>be associated with
the necessary control of the recommendation of therapeutic and
preventive measures in general. A supreme sanitary authority</b>
should be constituted, <b>part of whose duties</b> should be to <b>examine
the form and contents</b> of recommendations of this character.</p>

<p>Another juristic relationship of the prophylaxis of venereal
diseases concerns <b>legal protection against venereal infection</b>.
Franz von <span class="nowrap">Liszt,<a id="FNanchor342"></a><a href="#Footnote342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span>
von <span class="nowrap">Bar,<a id="FNanchor343"></a><a href="#Footnote343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span>
and <span class="nowrap">Schm&ouml;lder,<a id="FNanchor344"></a><a href="#Footnote344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span>
opened the discussion
on the biological and criminal aspects of the prophylaxis of
venereal diseases at the first congress of the Society for the Suppression
of Venereal Diseases, held at Frankfurt-on-the-Main in
the year 1903.</p>

<p>Hitherto the heedless or deliberate transmission of venereal
disease was punishable only as personal injury, since in the
Criminal Code there was no paragraph directly relating to this
matter. Only in the Criminal Code of Oldenburg of 1884 was
such punishment expressly provided for (Article 387), and by
this provision <b>the intercourse of an infected person with a healthy
one was punishable, without regard to the subsequent infection</b>.
In the legal regulations of other countries than Germany, we find
several instances in which the witting transmission of venereal
infection by means of sexual intercourse is punishable. In Germany<span class="pagenum" id="Page383">[383]</span>
a measure proposing this was rejected by the Reichstag
in 1900. Von Liszt advocated the introduction of the following
paragraph into the Criminal Code:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;One who, being aware that he is suffering from a contagious
venereal disorder, performs coitus, or in any other way exposes another
human being to the danger of infection, shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term of two to three years, and in addition shall be
deprived of civil rights.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Schm&ouml;lder enlarged this clause by an amendment relating to
the punishment of prostitutes disseminating venereal diseases.</p>

<p>On the other hand, von Bar drew attention to the inconveniences
and dangers which a punishment of this nature would involve,
especially to the dangers of <b>blackmail</b>, and to the <b>duty it would
impose on physicians</b> of breaking their obligations of professional
secrecy. Moreover, a proof of the <b>knowledge</b> of venereal infection
is difficult to obtain; the proof that infection is derived from
a definite person is also far from easy. Von Bar opposed the addition
of such a clause on this and other grounds. In the discussion
upon the motion, this view was shared by C. Fr&auml;nkel, Ries,
Oppenheimer, and others; Neisser was in favour of a punishment
of this kind, because then, at any rate, there would be a public
recognition of the fact that such an action was open to severe
<b>punishment</b>, and was a <b>disgraceful</b> one; thus, by the mere existence
of the paragraph an <b>educative influence</b> would be exerted.</p>

<p>In any case, such a punishment would be a two-edged weapon,
and as far as present necessity goes, we have sufficient powers in
the application to such offences of the paragraphs of the Criminal
Code relating to bodily injury.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">The second great means for the limitation and entire suppression
of venereal diseases is <b>to deal with them by medical treatment,
to cure as speedily as possible persons suffering from syphilis
of gonorrh&#339;a, and thus to prevent these persons from becoming
sources of fresh infection. Systematic, methodical treatment on
a large scale</b>&mdash;that is the <b>goal</b> at which we have to aim. To the
poor man or woman suffering from venereal infection the same
advantages should be opened as to the wealthy voluptuary. The
provision of means of treatment of venereal diseases <b>cannot be
too free</b>. In public hospitals, private clinics, ambulatoria, and
sanatoria, in convalescent homes, and polyclinics for prostitutes,
everywhere must be provided means for an intelligent treatment
of venereal diseases. Just as tuberculosis is now attacked systematically
and vigorously, so must it be with venereal diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page384">[384]</span></p>

<p>Since <b>syphilis</b> constitutes only about 25&nbsp;%&mdash;only one-fourth
part, that is to say&mdash;of venereal diseases in general, since also
during the last four centuries the disease has shown a natural
tendency to decline in virulence, since a mitigation in the intensity
of the virus is clearly recognizable, it is in the case of this
disease that the <b>hope of radical success</b> is especially great.</p>

<p>Our forefathers carried out for us a great part of the campaign
against syphilis. The <b>comparatively mild</b> course of syphilis in
the majority of uncomplicated cases leads us to infer that there
has been a relative immunization against syphilitic poison.</p>

<p>Albert Reibmayr remarks that &#8220;<b>during the last 400 years, every
human being now living in Europe has had about 4,000 ancestors;
of these, however disagreeable the fact may seem, a considerable
number must have had to contend with</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>syphilis</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor345"></a><a href="#Footnote345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>But this undoubted fact, that <b>all of us</b> have been to a certain
extent <span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>syphilized</b>,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor346"></a><a
href="#Footnote346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span> plays its part to our advantage in the
campaign against syphilis&mdash;that campaign which our own time
has taken up with joyful hope of success.</p>

<p>Above all, let honour be paid to the ever youthful and fresh
master and Nestor of European research into the subject of
syphilis, Alfred Fournier, the evening of whose life is devoted
to the campaign against syphilis as a &#8220;social danger.&#8221; To
the great scientific works of his life he has now added the
small, but not less valuable, <b>explanatory writings</b>, which are
being sold at a low price all over France, and in part also
have already been translated into German and
<span class="nowrap">English.<a id="FNanchor347"></a><a href="#Footnote347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span> Their
aim is to get the <b>people</b> on our side in the campaign against
syphilis.</p>

<p>When, in April, 1906, I paid the master a visit, he gave me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page385">[385]</span>
last of these popular campaign writings. Its title was in the
form of a question:</p>

<p class="center highline4">&#8220;En Gu&eacute;rit-on?&#8221; (&#8220;Is it Curable?&#8221;).</p>

<p class="noindent">And the answer given on p. 4 runs: &#8220;<b>Yes, it is curable, for of all
diseases syphilis is the one which can best, most easily, and most
certainly be cured.</b>&#8221; And why? Because we have a wonderful
specific against this disease, which, when given <b>at the proper
time</b> and <b>in the proper manner</b>, works a miracle. This remedy is</p>

<p class="center highline4"><b>Mercury</b>.</p>

<p>I put this name clearly and visibly before the eyes of the
reader, a name which for every physician to whose lot it falls to
treat cases of syphilis has a truly miraculous sound, a name
against which <b>the unconscientious ignoramuses, the evil-disposed
enemies</b> of the human race have spoken their anathema, one
which a great thinker and honourable man like Schopenhauer
regarded as a &#8220;triumph of medicine,&#8221; a fact which he experienced
personally in his own body. All honourable, critical, and
scientific physicians agree in this opinion. In my work on &#8220;The
Origin of Syphilis,&#8221; vol. i., p. 127, I have expressed the matter in
the following words:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Mercury is and remains&mdash;notwithstanding the ignorant and ill-considered
hostility of quacks and their kindred&mdash;the <b>divine means</b> for
the treatment of syphilis; mercury is to syphilis what <b>water is to fire</b>,
in the hands <b>of that physician who knows how to use the drug rightly</b>,
how to apply it <b>at the right time</b> and <b>in the right form</b>, who watches
closely the <b>course</b> of the disease in his patient, and who supports the
mercury cure (always of <b>primary importance</b>) by other therapeutic
measures as indicated.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Only the <b>physician</b>, the scientifically trained medical man, can
cure syphilis; the quack certainly cannot; in his hands mercury
is truly enough a dangerous &#8220;poison.&#8221; But he has no right to
say, and he speaks deliberate untruths when he says, that we
physicians &#8220;poison&#8221; the &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; syphilitics with mercury.
To such preposterous accusations we can give a brief and
incisive answer.</p>

<p>Therefore, during my lecturing journey, undertaken
<span class="nowrap">recently<a id="FNanchor348"></a><a href="#Footnote348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span>
under the auspices of the German Society for the Suppression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page386">[386]</span>
Venereal Diseases, I prepared the following brief account of the
therapeutic employment of mercury in syphilis, which in my
opinion suffices to throw the proper light upon the value and
importance of the mercurial treatment of the disease; it is a
sufficient answer to the &#8220;Nature-Healers,&#8221; who are opposed to
the use of this &#8220;poison&#8221;:</p>

<p>1. <b>In innumerable instances it has been observed by the most
experienced and scientific physicians, that cases of syphilis treated
without mercury run a very severe course, accompanied by the
most dangerous symptoms, such as extensive destructive lesions
of the skin, lesions of the internal organs, brain syphilis, eating
away of the bones, loss of the nose, etc.</b></p>

<p>2. <b>In cases which previously have been treated without mercury,
the administration of the latter drug immediately arrests the
destructive processes, and saves the patient from death, or from
very severe illness, and from physical disfigurement.</b></p>

<p>3. <b>No less an authority than Virchow, in his celebrated treatise
&#8220;On the Nature of Constitutional Syphilitic Affections,&#8221; pp. 7-14
(Berlin, 1859), has shown that the hypothesis of
<span class="nowrap">Hermann<a id="FNanchor349"></a><a href="#Footnote349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span> is
entirely devoid of foundation in fact.</b></p>

<p>4. <b>I should feel conscientiously compelled to denounce myself
for the commission of grievous bodily harm if I ventured to-day,
after the accumulated experience of four centuries, to treat a case
of syphilis without mercury.</b></p>

<p>What use is it to continue to fight against the disbelief and
superstition which clings to mercury? Why should we for ever
be occupied in contradicting the false accusations brought against
this drug? For four centuries the divine mercury has withstood
all attacks, and will continue to withstand them, until a greatly
desired and even better measure is discovered&mdash;<b>prophylactic
immunization against syphilitic</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>infection</b>.<a id="FNanchor350"></a><a href="#Footnote350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>How mercury is to be given, whether in the form of the long-prized
&#8220;<b>schmierkur</b>&#8221; (<b>cure by inunction</b>), or by <b>hypodermic injection</b>,
or by <b>ordinary internal use</b>, must be left in individual cases
to the decision of the medical man, for numerous considerations,
which can only be properly weighed by the physician, have to be
taken into account. A mercury cure is a <b>serious</b> matter, but
always also one which repays all the trouble that we take. In
&#8220;En Gu&eacute;rit-on?&#8221; Fournier has most admirably described the<span class="pagenum" id="Page387">[387]</span>
wonderful results of a <b>critically considered and carefully conducted</b>
mercury cure. I do not, indeed, belong to the &#8220;doctors who
build for themselves a house of pure quicksilver,&#8221; when they enter
the field against the &#8220;French&#8221; (= syphilis), as the phrase runs in
Schiller&#8217;s work &#8220;The Robbers.&#8221; I hold by a <b>reasonable, measured</b>
use of mercury in the course of the treatment of syphilis, and I
advise a good &#8220;<b>after-treatment</b>&#8221; in addition to the treatment
with <span class="nowrap">mercury.<a id="FNanchor351"></a><a href="#Footnote351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span>
Mercury, when given in moderate but sufficient
doses, not only destroys the syphilitic virus, but also has a very
favourable influence on the general condition, and sometimes even
gives rise to an increase in the number of the red blood-corpuscles.
Thus, mercury is not only not a poison: it is a most valuable <b>restorative
and vitalizing means</b>. This is well illustrated by the following
case, which came under my own observation, and which I recommend
to the Nature-Healers, in the hope that it may lead them to
revise their views regarding the action of mercury:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The case was that of an official, thirty years of age, who had been
under my care several times before since the year 1898 for other
troubles (gonorrh&#339;a, etc.), and who was always pale and with hollow
cheeks, in no way giving the impression of possessing a constitution
with strong powers of resistance. Late in the summer he was infected
with syphilis; the attack proved a severe one, running a serious course,
complicated by an extremely painful suppurative inflammation of the
lymphatic vessels of the penis, and accompanied by fever, lassitude,
and a sense of exhaustion. An energetic inunction cure was immediately
begun. Under this not only did the morbid symptoms rapidly
disappear, but there occurred a remarkable change in the general condition,
in the sense of an increase of strength, such as had not existed
before the illness. Notwithstanding slight stomatitis, the patient
during and after the cure <b>felt stronger and more fit for work than he ever
had before</b>, and even now this favourable state continues unaltered, as
is manifested above all by the increase in the body-weight, by the good
appearance, etc. <b>The patient</b>, who now, one and a half years after the
cure, has had no relapse, <b>informed me repeatedly and spontaneously
that this delightful improvement in his health could only be attributed
to his syphilis (!) or to the mercury!</b></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A <b>single</b> mercury cure will suffice, in some cases, to cure syphilis
for ever! Regarding this, we have numerous trustworthy observations.
In most cases, indeed, during the early years relapses
occur, and then we need to use the indispensable mercury cure once
more <b>with care</b>, and to employ all the other measures which make
up the above-mentioned &#8220;after-treatment,&#8221; the supplementary
means being, above all, <b>iodide of potassium, sulphur</b> (in the long-celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page388">[388]</span>
sulphur-baths of Aix, Nenndorf, etc.) and <b>arsenic</b> (first
recommended by me); also the water cure, brine-baths, and iodide-baths,
and a visit to the seaside or to the mountains, and massage,
are good accessory means to the cure. Above all, however, <b>the
State of nutrition</b> of the <span class="nowrap">patient<a id="FNanchor352"></a><a href="#Footnote352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span>
must always be kept under consideration,
and assisted where necessary, for which purpose
preparations of iron, nutritive preparations like sanatogen, and
milk cures, are of value. <b>Strict abstinence</b> from alcohol is
always necessary in the treatment of syphilis. Alcohol has
a <b>very unfavourable</b> influence on the syphilitic process, and
is often the only cause of continually recurring relapses of this
disease.</p>

<p>The <b>thorough</b> treatment of syphilis is a matter of several years,
during which the patient must repeatedly present himself to the
physician for examination, and should any relapse occur, he must
be subjected to renewed treatment. Such thoroughness will
invariably be rewarded. <b>Attention to detail</b> will always bear fruit.
Syphilis is <b>curable</b>. It is purely fanciful to say that syphilis is
never cured, that it pursues its victims up to the end of life, that
it knows no pardon. That is not true. <b>Treat</b> your syphilitic
patients, treat them properly and thoroughly, if necessary for
years in succession, and they will be freed from the disease.
&#8220;Syphilis,&#8221; says Fournier, &#8220;is a misfortune, but it is a misfortune
from which complete recovery is possible.&#8221; From the day when
the patient becomes aware that he is suffering from syphilis, he
must face the situation &#8220;in a calm and manly fashion,&#8221; and must
say to himself:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Now there is to be a fight between syphilis and me. To work,
therefore, and courage! Courage, because science assures me that
with the aid of <b>mercury</b>, of <b>hygiene</b>, and of <b>time</b>, an end will come to the
syphilis, and because science gives me an absolute assurance that some
day I shall be as healthy as I was before, and that I shall again have
the right to a family, that I shall attain the freedom and the happiness
of being a <span class="nowrap">father!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor353"></a><a href="#Footnote353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>With these admirable words of the greatest living authority on
syphilis, I close my account of the suppression of syphilis by
medical treatment, and turn to the not less important question
of the <b>management of gonorrh&#339;a</b>.</p>

<p>Recent scientific researches, especially those of A. Neisser and
E. Finger, have shown that the infective urethritis of the male<span class="pagenum" id="Page389">[389]</span>
produced by gonococci is by no means the &#8220;trifling and childish
complaint&#8221; which it was formerly supposed to be, but, on the
contrary, is a very serious and obstinate trouble, often resisting
the very best means of treatment, so that it may <b>persist for years</b>,
and <b>remain for years infective</b>. Still worse is it as regards gonorrh&#339;a
of the female genital organs, the cure of which is even more
difficult, and the consequences of which are even more disastrous
than in the case of the male. If the <b>physician</b> is needed for the
cure of syphilis, still more is this the case as regards gonorrh&#339;a.
He only can command the scientific methods, and the very complicated
technique of the treatment of gonorrh&#339;a. He only can
undertake the <b>indispensable</b> control of the treatment by means of
<b>microscopic</b> and other methods of investigation. Every cobbler
thinks he can cure gonorrh&#339;a, and yet it is this disease which,
even more than syphilis, demands the most precise knowledge of
the local anatomical and pathological conditions. Blaschko
rightly says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;While no one gives a damaged watch to a baker to mend, or a torn
coat to a tinsmith, every one seems to believe that in order to restore
the most valuable gift of humanity, health, it is unnecessary to
possess the profoundest knowledge of the human body, and to understand
the nature and the causes of the disease. Anyone who has come
to grief in his ordinary profession, but who understands how with a
brazen voice to denounce the so-called &#8216;medicine of the schools,&#8217; and
to praise with sufficient confidence his own successes, is supposed to
possess the wonderful power, without any exact knowledge at all, of
charming all the illnesses of mankind out of the world.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Gonorrh&#339;a is also a <b>curable</b> disease, though curable often with
great difficulty. We see this from the fact that, notwithstanding
the extraordinarily wide diffusion of gonorrh&#339;a (for a far greater
number of infections with gonorrh&#339;a occur than of infections
with syphilis), still ultimately the <b>majority</b> of the men, and a large
proportion of the women, infected with gonorrh&#339;a are <b>completely
cured</b> of their trouble.</p>

<p>The treatment of gonorrh&#339;a is a complicated affair. <b>Within
the first two days</b>, by the injection of <b>powerful caustic agents</b>,
we are sometimes able to cut the matter short and to put an
end completely to the gonococci. In every case the patient, as
soon as he perceives a discharge, though not yet purulent, from the
urethra, should <b>immediately</b> consult a physician, in order to determine
the nature of his disease, which, in the majority of cases,
will be found to be true gonorrh&#339;a. If it is not possible to abort
the gonorrh&#339;a, then the disease will have to run its course. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page390">[390]</span>
best measure, whenever possible, is <b>rest in bed</b> for a week or two,
in association with a <b>mild, unstimulating diet</b>, and the <b>absolute
prohibition of all alcoholic beverages</b>&mdash;the last is indispensable
throughout the duration of the gonorrh&#339;a&mdash;the drinking of uva
ursi tea, and, if the inflammatory symptoms are severe, the
application of cold compresses to the penis. Only when the first
more severe symptoms have passed away, by which time, owing
to the reaction of the urethral mucous membrane, a large proportion
of the exciters of the disease will already have been expelled, is
it time to begin <b>injections</b> or <b>irrigations</b> of the <b>urethra</b>, containing
medicaments the nature of which must be left to the decision of the
experienced <b>physician</b>, who will regard each individual case on its
own merits. If rest in bed is not possible, the patient must wear a
so-called &#8220;<b>suspensory</b>&#8221; bandage, in order to give as much rest as
possible to the testicles and the epididymis, which are gravely
endangered in every attack of gonorrh&#339;a. If, as often happens,
gonorrh&#339;a ascends to the posterior part of the urethra, or to the
bladder, or to the prostate, or if, finally, it becomes chronic, then
special methods of treatment, with <b>internal medicines, with local
cauterization, massage, distension, medicated bougies, baths</b>, etc.,
are needful. The cure will ensue very gradually; relapses are frequent;
even cessation of the discharge is no certain sign of cure,
as the presence in the still turbid urine of &#8220;threads&#8221; containing
gonococci sufficiently proves. Only when the urine has become
perfectly clear, and any threads which it may contain are shown
by repeated search to contain no more gonococci; when also the
prostate, a favourite seat of the last remnants of gonorrh&#339;a, is
free from inflammation, can the cure be regarded as complete.
Even more difficult is the determination of a cure in women.
But persistency in the treatment, and frequently repeated
examinations, will lead also in women to the desired goal,
or, at any rate, will overcome the capacity for spreading the
infection.</p>

<p>In the campaign against venereal diseases by the methods of
medical treatment, the <b>facilitation</b> of treatment for the <b>great masses
of impecunious</b> persons, for the proletariat, is of great value. For
them, above all, the provision of
<span class="nowrap"><i>Krankenkassen</i><a id="FNanchor354"></a><a href="#Footnote354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span>
is needed, and it
is very satisfactory to note that during recent years the Krankenkassen<span class="pagenum" id="Page391">[391]</span>
have especially directed their attention to venereal diseases,
since A. <span class="nowrap">Blaschko,<a id="FNanchor355"></a><a href="#Footnote355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
A. <span class="nowrap">Neisser,<a id="FNanchor356"></a><a href="#Footnote356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span> R.
<span class="nowrap">Ledermann,<a id="FNanchor357"></a><a href="#Footnote357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span> and Albert
<span class="nowrap">Kohn<a id="FNanchor358"></a><a href="#Footnote358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></span>
drew attention to the duties of Krankenkassen in this relationship
in a number of admirable works. Krankenkassen are in a position
to obtain exact statistics regarding venereal diseases; to diffuse
information, verbally and in writing, to the widest extent among
their members; to facilitate hospital treatment, and treatment by
specialists; to give medical aid as required to infected relatives of
the insured; to carry out regularly every year, once or twice, a
medical examination of all members, and to distribute among all
these writings on the prophylaxis of venereal diseases. The
question also of payment on the part of the patient requires new
regulations as regards venereal
<span class="nowrap">diseases.<a id="FNanchor359"></a><a href="#Footnote359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, it has been recommended that, in association with the
Krankenkassen there should be founded &#8220;<b>daily sanatoria</b>&#8221;
(Neisser), &#8220;<b>work sanatoria</b>&#8221; (Saalfeld), &#8220;<b>ambulatory places for
treatment</b>&#8221; (Ledermann), and &#8220;<b>convalescent homes</b>&#8221; (Stern), for
members of Krankenkassen suffering from venereal disease, and
for insured persons similarly affected. All these institutions
would, moreover, be valuable to the community at large.</p>

<p>What admirable results are obtainable by such a <b>systematic</b>
treatment of as far as possible <b>all</b> the venereal patients throughout
an entire country has been shown by the astonishing decline in
the number of cases of venereal diseases in Sweden and Norway,
and in Bosnia, where a gratuitous treatment of all such patients
at the cost of the state has been introduced. Thus the <b>organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page392">[392]</span>
campaign</b> against venereal diseases, which during recent years has
been initiated in all the civilized countries of Europe, has led more
particularly to efforts in the direction of the sufficient treatment
and speedy cure of <b>recent</b> syphilis and <b>recent</b> gonorrh&#339;a.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">We pass now to the consideration of the <b>third</b> factor in the
campaign against venereal disease, which comprises the duty of the
<b>state</b>, the task of <b>social hygiene</b>, and the task of <b>public pedagogy</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>foundation</b> for the suppression of venereal diseases by
state effort consists in a knowledge of the <b>extent of the diffusion</b> of
these diseases; we need, that is to say, <b>accurate statistics regarding
venereal diseases</b>.</p>

<p>It is once more the great service of Blaschko to have been the
first in Germany to work on these
<span class="nowrap">lines.<a id="FNanchor360"></a><a href="#Footnote360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Dismissing from consideration the distribution of venereal
diseases in countries outside of Europe, regarding which he gives
interesting reports, we find that the European conditions are of
such a nature that the large towns, the centres of industry and
manufacture, garrison towns, and university towns, are most
severely affected; that the smaller provincial towns suffer less;
that the agricultural population is comparatively free from this
disease, with the exception of the uncultivated country districts
of Russia and of the Balkan States, where the country people
suffer from syphilis to a terrible extent. No exact statistical
data are at present available regarding the diffusion of venereal
diseases in the individual countries of Europe. The best measure
of the prevalence of these diseases is afforded by the figures for
the different armies. From these we learn that Denmark,
Germany, German Austria, and Switzerland, show the most
favourable conditions; next come Belgium, France, Spain,
Portugal, North and Middle Italy. Worst of all are the conditions
in Southern Italy, Greece, Turkey, Russia, and&mdash;England.
These army statistics are, however, insufficient, for, as a matter
of fact, <b>England</b> is most favourably placed in respect of the
diffusion of venereal diseases. The most exact reports come from
the Scandinavian countries, from Norway and Denmark, in which
for several years <b>all physicians</b> have kept a list of all the infective
diseases treated by them, as they are compelled <b>every week</b> to
make a return to the Board of Public Health. According to these
reports, it appears that venereal diseases in Copenhagen constitute
the greater part of such diseases in the entire country; but in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page393">[393]</span>
period between 1876 and 1895 these diseases have notably <b>declined</b>
in frequency in Copenhagen, and all venereal diseases have shared
in this decline; gonorrh&#339;a constitutes 70&nbsp;% <b>of all</b> cases of venereal
disease. With regard to the diffusion of infection, it appears
from the Copenhagen statistics that <b>one</b> woman with venereal
disease serves to transmit it to <b>four</b> men; on the other hand, of
<b>four</b> men with venereal disease, <b>one</b> only will transmit that disease
to a woman. On the average, there are infected with venereal
disease every year 16 to 20&nbsp;% of all young men between the
ages of twenty and thirty years; with gonorrh&#339;a 1 in 8 are
infected; with syphilis 1 in 55 are infected. In these last ten
years, for every 100 young men living, there have been 119 infections
during ten years; that is to say, <b>on the average every one
has been infected once, and a great many have been infected more
than once</b>; in the same period of ten years, for every 100 young
men, there have been 18 infected with syphilis&mdash;that is to say,
1 for every 5&middot;5.</p>

<p>Especially valuable also are the figures which Blaschko
obtained in 1898 from the carefully kept books of a large mercantile
Krankenkasse whose operations were diffused throughout
Germany; these figures also give the result of an inquiry regarding
venereal diseases amongst workmen, waiting-maids, secret prostitutes,
and students. The result of these statistics, as regards
Berlin, are given briefly in the following table:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="centerblock">

<p class="legend">Secret Prostitutes, 30&nbsp;%.<br />

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Venereal Diseases Affecting Various Classes of the Population
of Berlin (after Blaschko).</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>According to these statistics, the diffusion of venereal diseases
among <b>shop employees</b>, <b>students</b>, and <b>secret prostitutes</b> (chiefly
<b>barmaids</b> and <b>waitresses</b>), is the greatest; it is much <b>less</b> among<span class="pagenum" id="Page394">[394]</span>
<b>workmen</b> and <b>soldiers</b>. It further appears, from Blaschko&#8217;s
inquiry, that <b>of the men who entered on marriage for the first time
when above the age of thirty years, each one had, on the average,
had gonorrh&#339;a twice</b>, and <b>about one in four or five had been
infected with syphilis</b>. Wilhelm Erb, in Heidelberg, obtained
similar results.</p>

<p>Still more remarkable were the results of the statistical investigation
which was carried out for the <b>entire Kingdom of Prussia</b> by
the Prussian Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction
on April 30, <span class="nowrap">1900.<a id="FNanchor361"></a><a href="#Footnote361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>According to this investigation, it appeared that on this day, in
Prussia, there were 41,000 persons suffering from venereal disease,
among whom 11,000 were infected with recent syphilis; in Berlin,
on the same day, there were 11,600 cases of venereal disease,
among whom 3,000 were infected with recent syphilis. The
general relations are shown in the following table:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Venereal Diseases Affecting the Male Population of Prussia,
April 30, 1900 (after Blaschko).</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Thus, for every 10,000 adult men there were on this day
persons suffering from venereal diseases to the following numbers:
in Berlin, 142; in the remaining large towns, 100; in the smaller
towns, 50; and in the whole of Prussia, on the average, 28.
Naturally the figures should in reality be larger, for of the
physicians to whom inquiries were sent, only 63&nbsp;% returned an<span class="pagenum" id="Page395">[395]</span>
answer. Moreover, the <b>annual</b> figure of cases is a very much
larger one. <span class="nowrap">Kirchner<a id="FNanchor362"></a><a href="#Footnote362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span>
assumes that <b>every day</b> in Prussia more
than <b>100,000 individuals</b>&mdash;that is to say, about 3 per mille&mdash;are
suffering from a transmissible venereal disease, and he estimates
the damage to the national property by typhoid fever as about
8 million marks annually, but that from venereal diseases as not
less than <b>ninety million marks annually</b>. In these reports of
April 30, 1900, the ratio of men to women suffering from recent
syphilis was as 3&nbsp;: 1.</p>

<p>In order to obtain more exact information regarding the
diffusion of venereal diseases, and the actual number of those
affected by them, it is of very great importance that there should
be a <b>revision</b> of the duty of medical men in respect of the <b>notification
of diseases</b>, and also in respect of the duty of <b>professional</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>secrecy</b>.<a id="FNanchor363"></a><a href="#Footnote363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>This latter question is also of importance in respect of the prevention
of venereal infection in married life. (The question of
syphilitic infection of married women by their husbands has
recently been considered by Alfred Fournier: &#8220;Syphilis in
Honourable Women.&#8221;)</p>

<p>In addition to the question of the diffusion and frequency of
venereal diseases, the greatest interest attaches to the <b>sources of
dangerous infections</b>&mdash;that is to say, the question where men and
women most frequently contract venereal disease.</p>

<p>Here also Blaschko has obtained interesting information; he
states:</p>

<p>Of 487 syphilitic men, the disease was acquired by 395 (81&middot;1&nbsp;%)
from professional prostitutes (officially inscribed or secret); 23
(4&middot;7&nbsp;%) from waitresses and barmaids; 23 (4&middot;9&nbsp;%) from their
&#8220;intimate&#8221;; 45 (9&middot;2&nbsp;%) from casual acquaintances, shop-girls, or
workwomen.</p>

<p>According to this report, it appears that <b>prostitution</b>, public<span class="pagenum" id="Page396">[396]</span>
and secret (under which heading the waitresses and &#8220;casual
acquaintances&#8221; must be numbered), forms the <b>principal focus</b> of
venereal infection.</p>

<p>And that wild sexual intercourse is here almost exclusively to
blame is shown by the following statistics, given by Blaschko:</p>

<p>Of 67 syphilitic wives, almost all the wives of workmen, 64 were
infected by their <b>husbands</b>; whereas, <b>on the contrary</b>, of 106 husbands,
7 only acquired the disease from their wives; the remaining
99 acquired it by <b>extra-conjugal sexual intercourse</b>, either before
or after marriage.</p>

<p>Another very valuable set of statistics dealing with the sources
of infection has been published by Heinrich
<span class="nowrap">Loeb.<a id="FNanchor364"></a><a href="#Footnote364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>These relate to the conditions in Mannheim. It appears that
the sources of infection were as follows:</p>

<p>Here, as we see, the chief types of <b>secret</b> prostitution, the
<b>waitresses</b> and <b>barmaids</b>, play the principal part; next, but a long
way after, come maidservants and shop-girls. This, however,
does not amount to saying that public prostitution is less dangerous.
We know that a prostitute who has never been infected
with venereal disease is something very rarely seen; that prostitutes
under regulation are almost all, especially when still quite
young, in an infective state, and that they serve just as much as
secret prostitutes for the diffusion of venereal disease. It is a
well-known fact that youthful prostitutes are <b>more dangerous</b> than
women who have long practised prostitution, because the former
are all suffering from more or less recent infection, and both<span class="pagenum" id="Page397">[397]</span>
gonorrh&#339;a and syphilis are present in them in the stages in which
they are still strongly infective. H. Berger bases upon statistical
<span class="nowrap">investigations<a id="FNanchor365"></a><a href="#Footnote365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span>
his belief that red-haired girls have the most delicate
epithelium, fall sick most rapidly and in the greatest numbers;
dark haired women at first suffer less. After they have been prostitutes
for some time, there is no important difference between
blonde, brown, and black-haired women; but black-haired
prostitutes are, in fact, more inclined to infection <b>later</b> in their
career, because they are more in request.</p>

<p>Now that we have learned that at the present day <b>prostitution</b>
remains the principal source of venereal infection, the following
question immediately demands an answer: <b>What can the state
do in order to remove these sources of infection? and have the
measures which the state has hitherto put into operation been of
any use in this direction?</b> To put it shortly, what part has been
played by the state <b>regulation</b> of prostitution, as hitherto practised,
in the campaign against venereal diseases?</p>

<p>With <span class="nowrap">Schm&ouml;lder,<a id="FNanchor366"></a><a href="#Footnote366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
we understand by &#8220;regulation&#8221; the following
practice, which is what obtains in the majority of civilized
countries: The police keep a list in which the girls and women
regarded by them as prostitutes have their names entered. The
&#8220;inscribed&#8221; (<i>inscrites</i>) receive a &#8220;<i>licentia stupri</i>&#8221;&mdash;that is
to say, <b>the permission to practise professional fornication under
continual observation on the part of the police</b> (the renowned
&#8220;moral <span class="nowrap">control&#8221;<a id="FNanchor367"></a><a href="#Footnote367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>),
which is associated with a number of commands,
prohibitions, and regulations&mdash;above all, with the <b>necessity
of submitting to medical examination at definitely stated
intervals</b>, and, where necessary, to <b>compulsory medical treatment</b>.
At the same time, public prostitution on the part of those who
are not inscribed is suppressed as much as possible. Berger has
admirably described (&#8220;Prostitution in Hanover,&#8221; pp. 1-19) the
methods of regulation and their consequences. Above all, however,
have Blaschko, Schm&ouml;lder, and Neisser considered the modes
of regulation customary at the present day from the moral, legal,
and medical points of view, and have in part entirely condemned
them (Blaschko and Schm&ouml;lder), in part declared them to be
gravely in need of reform
<span class="nowrap">(Neisser).<a id="FNanchor368"></a><a href="#Footnote368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page398">[398]</span></p>

<p>Among those who have recently discussed the question of the
regulation of prostitution, we may mention Anna
<span class="nowrap">Pappritz,<a id="FNanchor369"></a><a href="#Footnote369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span> who
condemns the practice; Clausmann, who is in favour of
<span class="nowrap">it;<a id="FNanchor370"></a><a href="#Footnote370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span>
Friedrich Hammer, also in favour of
<span class="nowrap">it;<a id="FNanchor371"></a><a href="#Footnote371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span> and, finally, S. Bettmann,
who leaves the question <span class="nowrap">open.<a id="FNanchor372"></a><a href="#Footnote372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>In our consideration of the coercive system of regulation, we
take a <b>single standpoint</b>&mdash;namely, that of its possible value for
the suppression of venereal diseases. Some demand the <b>abolition</b>
of regulation on ethical and humanitarian grounds, and we do
not wish in any way to make light of these grounds. But they
could not be decisive, if, as an actual fact, regulation had an
effect either in diminishing the prevalence of venereal diseases
or in checking prostitution; but, in truth, the <b>reverse</b> is the
case!</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Schm&ouml;lder<a id="FNanchor373"></a><a href="#Footnote373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span>
has shown beyond dispute that the compulsory
inscription of prostitutes, introduced from France, is in our
country an utterly <b>illegal</b> measure, arbitrarily enforced by
the police. It has been amply proved that this illegal compulsory
inscription has actually made prostitutes of many girls
who had no inclination to permanent professional prostitution;
that this method <b>produces artificial prostitutes</b>. What errors
of judgment, what abuses of power, occur on the part of the
police, in connexion with this compulsory inscription! How
often does the inscription result from a denunciation made on
grounds of private spite! The &#8220;Committee of Fifteen,&#8221; constituted
for the study of prostitution in New York, declares in
its report:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Men with political insight are of opinion that every limitation of
the freedom of the individual is in itself an evil, and that such a limitation
can only be justified in cases in which the good derived from the
infringement can really be estimated at a very high valuation. A
system which permits the police, simply on grounds of suspicion, to
arrest a citizen, to submit him to an injurious examination, only with
the aim of discovering a disease he is suspected to have, and then to<span class="pagenum" id="Page399">[399]</span>
put him into prison, on the suspicion that he might have indulged in
immoral intercourse if he had been left at liberty, cannot possibly be
regarded as harmonizing with the principles of personal
<span class="nowrap">freedom.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor374"></a><a href="#Footnote374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Blaschko and Fiaux have proved that regulation concerns only
a <b>small fraction</b> of prostitutes, usually the older ones; whereas
the <b>beginners</b>, who are precisely those most dangerous in respect
of venereal infection, and, further, the army of <b>secret prostitutes</b>,
<b>half prostitutes</b>, <b>occasional prostitutes</b>, and the <b>half-world</b>, remain
free from regulation&mdash;are probably left free deliberately&mdash;and
anyhow could not possibly be supervised, on account of the
enormous cost of supervision. In Berlin, speaking generally, only
<b>one-fifth</b> part of the girls arrested are subjected to regulation,
four-fifths are simply &#8220;warned and discharged&#8221;; and even of
this fifth part, in reality a large percentage does not come under
control because &#8220;escape from the lists&#8221; renders permanent
observation impossible. Fiaux proves that <b>more than 50&nbsp;%</b> of
the medical examinations which ought to have been made on the
4,000 women under regulation in Berlin during the years 1888 to
1901, <b>were in fact</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>neglected</b>.<a id="FNanchor375"></a><a href="#Footnote375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>It is <b>certain</b> that regulated prostitution is <b>more dangerous</b>
from the point of view of public health than free prostitution.
The prostitute remaining under surveillance is in constant
fear of compulsory treatment in the lock hospital, and therefore
endeavours to conceal her illness <b>as long as possible, or temporarily
to avoid medical examination altogether</b>. The free prostitute
has a personal interest in becoming well again as soon as
possible, and generally goes voluntarily and at once to seek
treatment from a physician. Thus it happens that, among the
regulated prostitutes, the number of those infected <b>appears</b>
surprisingly small. In addition, we have to consider the <b>inadequacy
of the medical examination</b>, because the number of the
physicians and the time assigned to them are too small. And
whilst it appears to be a fact that every third prostitute is infected
with gonorrh&#339;a, in Berlin, during the year 1889, as the
result of official examination under regulation, only one prostitute
in 200 was declared infected, and in 1884 only 1 in
1,873. Moreover, <b>very many</b> infected prostitutes under compulsory<span class="pagenum" id="Page400">[400]</span>
medical treatment are, as Blaschko proves, allowed to
resume their professional occupation in an uncured state, and to
diffuse their illness freely once more. The figures given by
Blaschko speak very clearly on this point:</p>

<p>From this it is clear that the <b>abolition</b> of the regulation of
prostitutes will not have an unfavourable, but, on the contrary,
will have a thoroughly <b>favourable</b>, influence in respect of the
frequency of venereal diseases. The conditions in England and
Norway show this very clearly. In Christiania, after the abolition
of regulation in the year 1888, syphilis declined in frequency&mdash;in
the first place, because the number of girls who applied for
treatment increased, whilst prior to the abolition of regulation
they had concealed their illness in order to avoid falling into the
hands of the police; and in the second place, because now the
fear of venereal infection kept many young men from having
intercourse with prostitutes, whereas previously they had erroneously
believed that the &#8220;control&#8221; would free them from the
danger of venereal infection. The same was the case in London,
where there is no regulation; the frequency of venereal disease
has decreased because young men now avoid intercourse with
prostitutes as much as possible. In France, the country in which
regulation was first introduced, the commission formed for the
study of prostitution came to the conclusion that &#8220;<b>regulation
of prostitutes should be abolished</b>.&#8221; The principal reason for
which the police continue to advocate the preservation of the
system of regulation&mdash;namely, that they have an interest in the
matter on account of the <b>intimate connexion between many
prostitutes and criminality</b>&mdash;will not bear examination. It is true
enough that <span class="nowrap"><b>soutenage</b><a id="FNanchor376"></a><a href="#Footnote376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></span>
is inseparable from prostitution. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page401">[401]</span>
<b>the world of criminals</b> is very near to prostitution, in the
first place, because the prostitute also has need of a man on
whom she can lean, who can be something to her from the <b>personal</b>
point of view, to whom she is not simply a
<span class="nowrap">chattel;<a id="FNanchor377"></a><a href="#Footnote377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span> and,
in the second place, because the prostitute is, like the criminal,
<b>despised and defamed</b>&mdash;she shares with the criminal the pariah
nature. Lombroso&#8217;s doctrine that prostitution is throughout
equivalent to criminality is certainly not justified. <b>It is only by
the outward circumstances of their life that the bulk of prostitutes
are driven into intimate relations with criminality.</b> And among
these outward circumstances, <b>regulation</b>, and the <b>expulsion</b> of
prostitutes from honourable society (which is a necessary part
of regulation) play the principal r&ocirc;le! For this reason, if for
this reason alone, regulation must be abolished, because then a
strong supplement to criminality from the circles of prostitution
would be cut off.</p>

<p>Even before investigators had become convinced of the uselessness
and danger of regulation the cry arose: &#8220;<b>Away with the
brothels!</b>&#8221; We have already alluded to the continuous <b>decline</b>
in the number of brothels in all large towns. In 1841 there were
in Paris still 235 brothels (to 1,200,000 inhabitants); in 1900
there were only 48 brothels (to 3,600,000 inhabitants); and for
St. Petersburg and other large towns a similar decline in the
number of brothels can be established, notwithstanding the fact
that everywhere the population has markedly increased. This
proves that the brothels no longer correspond to any real
<span class="nowrap">need.<a id="FNanchor378"></a><a href="#Footnote378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></span>
At the present day, owing to the great development of intercourse
in modern times, brothels are a public calamity; they
bring the quarter of the town in which they exist into disrepute,
and deprive the neighbourhood of its proper monetary value.
Moreover, the time is past for slave-holding on the part of the
brothel-owner. The existence of brothels favours the traffic in
girls (the &#8220;White Slave Trade&#8221;), encourages sexual perversities,
and increases the diffusion of venereal diseases. The prostitute
living in a brothel is sometimes compelled to have intercourse
with ten or twelve men in a single day, and is thus pre-eminently
exposed to venereal infection, all the more because she must admit
the embraces of <b>every</b> man who pays the brothel-keeper money;
whilst the prostitute living freely can at least refuse to have anything
to do with a man who appears to her to be ill. According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page402">[402]</span>
Lecour, Mireur, Diday, and Sperk, prostitutes in brothels suffer
from syphilis about <b>three times as often</b> as free
<span class="nowrap">prostitutes.<a id="FNanchor379"></a><a href="#Footnote379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>Other modifications of brothel life, such as the so-called &#8220;<b>controlled</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>streets</b>,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor380"></a><a href="#Footnote380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span>
the best known of which are in
<span class="nowrap">Bremen<a id="FNanchor381"></a><a href="#Footnote381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>&mdash;that is
to say, streets closed to ordinary traffic, the houses of which are
inhabited only by prostitutes under control, but the girls being
in other respects free and not living under the domination of a
brothel-keeper; also the
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>Kasernierung</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor382"></a><a href="#Footnote382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span>
of prostitutes, their
confinement to particular streets, or special &#8220;quarters&#8221; of the
town <span class="nowrap">(&#8220;Dirnenquartiere&#8221;)<a id="FNanchor383"></a><a href="#Footnote383"
class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span>&mdash;are all to be rejected on the same
grounds.</p>

<p>The whole nature of brothel life, and the very serious dangers
it involves, have been discussed in excellent works by E. von
<span class="nowrap">D&uuml;ring,<a id="FNanchor384"></a><a href="#Footnote384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span>
Henriette <span class="nowrap">F&uuml;rth,<a id="FNanchor385"></a><a href="#Footnote385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span>
Karl <span class="nowrap">N&ouml;tzel,<a id="FNanchor386"></a><a href="#Footnote386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
and Martin <span class="nowrap">Bruck.<a id="FNanchor387"></a><a href="#Footnote387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>
They illumine the whole question, and provide sufficient grounds
for the condemnation of brothels.</p>

<p>A few authors, however, continue to advocate the preservation
of brothels, and some of these wish to enforce medical examination,
not only of prostitutes, but also of their masculine clients.
This proposition is made, for example, by Ernst Kromayer in his
work, which, notwithstanding many Utopian ideas, is nevertheless
very stimulating, &#8220;The Eradication of Syphilis,&#8221; pp. 67, 68
(Berlin, 1898). Von D&uuml;ring, in his criticism of these ideas,
rightly points out that this recommendation would be quite
useless in practice, because, in the first place, only a small proportion
of men visit brothels at all. In the second place, in the
hurry in these resorts no proper examination could be undertaken.
In the third place, the doctors who were to be appointed
as a kind of medical porters to brothels, would not easily be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page403">[403]</span>
to accept such situations. Lassar, who answers this last criticism,
is of opinion that the brothel-master, or anybody with a little
experience, could easily undertake this examination in the case
of <span class="nowrap">men.<a id="FNanchor388"></a><a href="#Footnote388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>But these men would probably also decline the office; and
even if they were willing, it is very doubtful if they would
be in a position to make the suggested examinations, which,
after all, require <b>real medical skill</b>; and, finally, the only result
would be&mdash;to increase the number of quacks. Therefore, this
idea of the examination of the male visitors to brothels is
Utopian.</p>

<p>No, the true hope lies in <b>absolute freedom</b>; in <b>relieving prostitution
from the oppression of the police</b>; in its gradual <b>separation
from criminality</b>; in&mdash;I am not afraid of the word&mdash;in an &#8220;<b>ennoblement</b>&#8221;
of <span class="nowrap">prostitution.<a id="FNanchor389"></a><a href="#Footnote389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span>
The &#8220;prostitute&#8221; (German <i>Dirne</i>
= drab) must disappear, and the &#8220;human being&#8221; must reawaken.
The prostituted woman must be readmitted into the social community.
No more coercion! <b>Free and voluntary treatment</b>, in
<span class="nowrap">polyclinics<a id="FNanchor390"></a><a href="#Footnote390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
and hospitals; the &#8220;<b>rescue</b>&#8221; of youthful <span class="nowrap">prostitutes,<a id="FNanchor391"></a><a href="#Footnote391"
class="fnanchor">[391]</a></span>
not in the prison-like &#8220;<b>Magdalen Homes</b>,&#8221; but by means of
ethically instructive influence <b>from human being to human
being</b>, of the value of which the &#8220;Letters to Prostitutes&#8221;
of the noble philanthropist Frau
<span class="nowrap">Eggers-Smidt,<a id="FNanchor392"></a><a href="#Footnote392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></span> and also
the experiences of the Salvation
<span class="nowrap">Army,<a id="FNanchor393"></a><a href="#Footnote393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></span> give such admirable
evidence.</p>

<p>Very aptly, also, Kromayer has shown to what an extent a
change in our present attitude towards sexual intercourse outside
the conditions of coercive marriage, the removal of the stamp
of infamy from such intercourse, would limit prostitution, and
therewith also limit venereal
<span class="nowrap">diseases.<a id="FNanchor394"></a><a href="#Footnote394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></span>
This is as clear as daylight.
But, unfortunately, those very persons who declare the
existing conditions in respect of prostitution to be absolutely
intolerable will not admit its truth.</p>

<p>The misery of the life of these unhappy creatures must be relieved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page404">[404]</span>
but <b>we</b> must do it <b>ourselves</b>, and soon; for they are not in
a position to do so. The last, the highest goal of the campaign
against venereal disease is the humanization of the
<span class="nowrap">prostitute.<a id="FNanchor395"></a><a href="#Footnote395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p id="Ref2"><span class="smcap">Supplementary Note.</span>&mdash;In the essay on &#8220;The Woman&#8217;s Question&#8221; in the
sociological section of his work, &#8220;The Ethic of Free-Thought,&#8221; Karl Pearson
discusses the question of Prostitution in relation to the Woman&#8217;s Question at

&#8220;the ennoblement of prostitution&#8221; and &#8220;the humanization of the prostitute,&#8221;
and it seems expedient to quote the passage at length (<i>op. cit.</i>, 1888,
pp. 379-382).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore1">&#8220;The emancipation of woman, while placing her in a position of social
responsibility, will make it her duty to investigate many matters of
which she is at present frequently assumed to be ignorant. It may be
doubted whether the identification of purity and ignorance has had
wholly good effects in the past; indeed, it has frequently been the false
cry with which men have sought to hide their own anti-social conduct.
It is certain, however, that it cannot last in the future, and man will
have to face the fact that woman&#8217;s views and social action with regard
to many sex-problems may widely differ from his own. It is of the
utmost importance that woman, not only on account of the part she
already plays in the education of the young, but also because of the
social responsibilities her emancipation must bring, should have a full
knowledge of the laws of sex. Every attempt hitherto to grapple with
prostitution has been a failure. What will women do when they
thoroughly grasp the problem, and have a voice in the attitude the
state should assume in regard to it? At present hundreds do not
know of its existence; thousands only know of it to despise those who
earn their living by it; one in ten thousand has examined the causes
which lead to it, has felt that degradation, if there be any, lies not in the
prostitute, but in the society where it exists; not in the women of the
streets, but in the thousands of women in society, who are ignorant of
the problem, ignore it, or fear to face it. What will be the result
of woman&#8217;s action in the matter? Can it possibly be effectual, or
will it merely tend to embitter the relations of men and women?
Possibly an expression of woman&#8217;s opinion on this point in society
and the press would do much, but then it must be an educated opinion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page405">[405]</span>
one which recognizes facts and knows the difficulties of the problem.
An appeal to chivalry, to a Christian dogma, to a Biblical text, will
hardly avail. The description we have of Calvin&#8217;s Geneva shows that
puritanic suppression is wholly idle. What form will be taken by
the reasoned action of women, cognizant of historical and sexualogical
fact?</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it may be that women, when they fully grasp the problem,
will despair, as many men do, of its solution. They may remark that
prostitution has existed in nearly all historic times, and among nearly
all races of men. It has existed as an institution as long as monogamic
marriage has existed; it may be itself the outcome of that
marriage. I do not know whether any trace of a like promiscuity has
been found in the animals nearest allied to man&mdash;I believe not. The
periodic instinct has probably preserved them from it. How mankind
came to lose the periodic instinct, and how that loss may possibly be
related to the solely human institution of marriage, are problems not
without interest. On the one hand, it has been asserted that prostitution
is a logical outcome of our <i>present</i> social relations, while, on the
other hand, it is held to be a survival of matriarchal licence, and not a
<i>sine qua non</i> of all forms of human society. There is very considerable
evidence to show that a large percentage of women are driven to
prostitution by absolute want, or by the extremities to which a seduced
woman is forced by the society which casts her out. This point is
important. It may, perhaps, be that our social system, quite as much
as man&#8217;s supposed needs, keeps prostitution alive. The frequency with
which prostitutes, for the sake of their own living, seduce comparative
boys, may be as much a cause of the evil as male passion itself. The
socialists hold the sale of a woman&#8217;s person to be directly associated
with the monopoly of surplus labour. Is the emancipated woman likely
to adopt this view? and if so shall we not have a wide-reaching social
reconstruction forced upon us? That emancipated woman would strive
for a vast economic reorganization, as the only means of preserving the
self-respect and independence of her sex, is a possibility with the
gravest and most wide-reaching consequences. We cannot emancipate
woman without placing her in a position of political and social influence
equal to man&#8217;s. It may well be that she will regard economic and
sexual problems from a very different standpoint, and the result will
infallibly lead to the formation of a woman&#8217;s party, and to a more or
less conscious struggle between the sexes. Would this end in an
increased social stability or another subjection of sex?</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman may, however, conclude that the alternative is true&mdash;that
prostitution is not the outcome of our present social organisation,
but a feature of all forms of human society. She must, then, treat it as
a necessary evil or as a necessary good. In the former case she will at
least insist on an equal social stigma attaching to both sexes if she does
not demand, as in the instance of any other form of anti-social conduct,
so far as practicable its legal repression. In the latter case&mdash;that is, if
its existence really tends in some way to the welfare or stability of society&mdash;women
will have to admit that prostitution is an honourable profession;
they cannot shirk that conclusion, bitter as it may appear to some.
The &#8216;social outcast&#8217; would then have to be recognized as filling a
social function, and the problem would reduce to the amelioration of
her life, and to her elevation in the social scale. Either there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page406">[406]</span>
means of abolishing prostitution, or all participators must be treated
alike as anti-social, or the prostitute is an honourable woman&mdash;no other
possibility suggests itself. Society has hitherto failed to find a remedy,
perhaps because only man has sought for one; woman, when she for the
time fully grasps the problem, must be prepared for one, or must
recognize the alternatives. There cannot be a doubt, however, that in
a matter so closely concerning her personal dignity she will take action,
and that, if only in this one matter, her freedom will raise questions,
which many would prefer to ignore, and which, when raised, will undoubtedly
touch principles apparently fundamental to our existing
social organization.&#8221;</p>

This conception of &#8220;partial syphilization&#8221; of our race appears somewhat
vague. If we take care to think clearly, and in terms of exact biological knowledge,
we shall see that&mdash;apart from a spontaneous loss of intensity on the part
of the syphilitic virus (of which we have no precise knowledge whatever)&mdash;the
only known way of accounting for syphilis having become milder is by natural
selection, by the death of those who suffered most severely from the disease.
Now, in 400 years, ten or twelve human generations, there has hardly been time
for the development of immunity to a disease to which at most a small fraction
only of the population has ever been exposed. It appears to me, however,
that we may reasonably doubt the alleged decline in the severity of syphilis. It
must be remembered that the entire absence of mercurial treatment at first, and
the misuse of that specific for many years after its value had been proved, will
account for much in respect of the apparent greater virulence of medieval as compared
with modern syphilis. (See also <a href="#Page356">p. 356</a>, and <a href="#Footnote315">footnote</a> to that page referring

Rudolf Lennhoff, in an address on February 8, 1907, to the local group of
Berlin of the German Society for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases on
&#8220;Venereal Diseases and Social Legislation,&#8221; drew especial attention to the
necessity of enrolling in the scheme of insurance against illness wider circles of
the impecunious population, especially the class of domestic servants. Servants
suffering from venereal disease, since at the present day they usually preserve
secrecy as to their trouble, in order that they may not lose their place, constitute
a dangerous source of infection for their employers and the latters&#8217; children.
Therefore, a particularly thorough and speedy treatment of servants suffering
from venereal diseases is necessary. It is further necessary to insist that all
the employees of the Krankenkassen should observe the duty of professional
secrecy. Recently the Landesversicherungsanstalt (an insurance institution) of
Berlin started a dispensary of its own in Lichtenberg for patients suffering from
venereal disease, in which every year more than 400 patients undergo treatment.</p>

Quite recently&mdash;October, 1906&mdash;the <b>first</b> step in this direction has been taken.
The Chief Commissioner of the Berlin Police addressed to the medical specialists
in venereal diseases an inquiry whether they were prepared to treat gratuitously
impecunious prostitutes who were not under police control. The girls would
then be given a register of these doctors. If they presented themselves for
treatment, no particulars about them would be demanded from the physician.
The presentation by the patients to the police of a certificate from a medical man
<b>would suffice to exempt them from police control, and from compulsory examination
and treatment at the police department of the section of the town
to which they belonged</b>. Further details will be arranged later in co-operation
with the Committee of the Society for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases.</p>

<p>In his valuable study, &#8220;The Future of Prostitution,&#8221; published in the monthly
magazine <i>Mutterschutz</i>, July, 1907, pp. 274-288, Havelook Ellis also takes an
extremely optimistic view regarding the gradual and inevitable diminution of
prostitution by indirect means&mdash;that is to say, in this way we are elevating ourselves
socially and economically to a higher stage of humanity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p class="noindent">Almost as widely diffused as venereal diseases are the abnormal
sexual manifestations to be considered in this chapter under the
general title of &#8220;States of Sexual Irritability and Sexual Weakness.&#8221;
They arise in part out of the <b>very nature of mankind</b>;
in part they are the external manifestations of a <b>natural impulse</b>,
of an instinctive excitement, in which form we see them also in
other animals; in part they are connected with man&#8217;s <b>spiritual</b>
nature, with <b>civilization</b>. We may, indeed, say that the duplex
nature of man, his bodily-spiritual dualism, is most clearly
reflected in this phenomenon of his sexuality. In this respect
he is wholly human.</p>

<p>It is a great service performed by Havelock
<span class="nowrap">Ellis<a id="FNanchor396"></a><a href="#Footnote396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></span> that he was
the first to direct attention to the &#8220;involuntary&#8221; manifestations
of the sexual impulse peculiar to mankind, occurring <b>without</b>
relation to the other sex. He gives them the distinctive name of
&#8220;<b>auto-erotism</b>,&#8221; by which he means &#8220;the phenomenon of spontaneous
sexual excitement manifesting itself <b>without any stimulus,
direct or indirect, supplied by any other person</b>.&#8221; For the most
part, therefore, the normal manifestations of art and poetry
belong also to the province of auto-erotism, in so far as they are
the result of erotic perception; and the same is true of all those
manifestations which I have termed &#8220;<b>sexual equivalents</b>,&#8221; all
transformations of sexual energy, such as religio-sexual phenomena,
the transformation of individual love into the general love of
mankind, the stimuli of fashion, and <b>every powerful activity</b> by
means of which sexual tension finds a mode of discharge, even
though this sexual relationship is usually of an unconscious
nature, as in the dance, in society games, and other enjoyments.</p>

<p>In my essay on &#8220;The Perverse,&#8221; pp. 14, 15 (Berlin, 1905), I
have shown that there is no doubt that these sexual equivalents,
taken in their entirety, have played an extremely
important part in the course of the evolution of mankind; that
they represent <b>the natural outlets</b> for feelings of tension and
excessive forces of sexual origin; and that they should not be
unnecessarily suppressed, unless we wish to evoke <b>much worse
and far more dangerous</b> variations of their activity&mdash;as, for
example, in the political sphere.</p>

<p>Appositely, I find in Friedrich Nietzsche&#8217;s &#8220;Posthumous<span class="pagenum" id="Page410">[410]</span>
Works&#8221; (vol. xii. of the &#8220;Collected Works,&#8221; p. 149; Leipzig,
1901) an interesting remark bearing on the question:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Many of our impulses find an outlet in a mechanically powerful
activity, which <b>can</b> be directed by intelligent purpose; unless this is
done, these manifestations are destructive and harmful. Hate,
anger, <b>the sexual impulse</b>, etc., can be <b>set to the machine</b> and taught
to do useful work&mdash;for example, to chop wood, to carry letters, or to
drive the plough. <b>Our impulses must be worked out.</b> The life of
the learned man more especially demands something of the kind.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>What a wise and apt remark! Our whole civilization is permeated
with sexual equivalents of this kind; the pleasure of life
and the joy of existence are based thereon, however much our
puritans and asexual &#8220;morality-fanatics&#8221; may strive against
this fact. And it is well that the sexual impulse has been &#8220;civilized,&#8221;
that there are now so many spontaneous modes of its
discharge, that the sphere of auto-erotism increases <i>pari passu</i>
with the growth of civilization. Many new, finer, and nobler
incitations and stimuli stream therefrom into love and life, upon
which they exercise a rejuvenating and strengthening influence.
Still, this light throws a shadow, inasmuch as fantastic and
unnatural aberrations of the sexual life are also apt to ensue.</p>

<p>Auto-erotism (including its grosser form, masturbation) is
therefore, to a certain extent, a <b>physiological</b> manifestation; it
becomes morbid only in certain conditions&mdash;that is to say, in
individuals who are previously <b>morbid</b>. This is, indeed, an old
medical doctrine, that there exists a physiological masturbation
<i>faute de mieux</i>, and a morbid masturbation in cases of neurasthenia,
mental disorder, and other troubles. The same is
true of auto-erotism in its entire extent. When F&uuml;rbringer
describes masturbation as &#8220;an <b>unnatural</b> gratification of the
sexual <span class="nowrap">impulse,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor397"></a><a href="#Footnote397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></span>
this is only partly true. There exists a <b>natural,
physiological masturbation</b>, a <b>normal</b> auto-erotism. Metchnikoff
shares this <span class="nowrap">view.<a id="FNanchor398"></a><a href="#Footnote398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></span>
He says: &#8220;<b>It is man&#8217;s constitution itself</b>
that permits the premature development of sexual sensibility,
before the reproductive elements are mature.&#8221; The ultimate
cause of such auto-erotic manifestations as belong neither to the
category of &#8220;vice&#8221; nor to that of &#8220;crime&#8221; is to be found, he
thinks, in a <b>disharmony</b> in the nature of man in respect of the
premature development of sexual sensibility. For this reason
we meet with these manifestations just as much among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page411">[411]</span>
lowest races of mankind as we do among civilized peoples; even
among <b>animals</b> auto-erotism is a widely diffused phenomenon.
This can be observed, not only among the monkeys (perhaps
already a little civilized) of our Zoological Gardens, which
masturbate freely <i>coram publico</i>, but it may be seen also in horses,
which shake the penis to and fro until seminal emission occurs;
also in mares, which rub themselves against any available firm
object. We see the same thing in wild deer. Even elephants
masturbate. Among primitive races masturbation is, perhaps,
even more general than among civilized races. Among South
African tribes, Gustav Fritsch reports, masturbation is actually
a popular custom.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis has described the entire auto-erotic instrumentarium,
and it appears from his account that savage races
manufacture onanistic stimulatory apparatus for women quite
as elaborate as those which are produced by the most highly
developed lewd industry of civilized peoples. Most frequently
articles in everyday use are employed for auto-erotic gratification&mdash;as
in Hawaii, bananas; in our own part of the world,
cucumbers, carrots, and beetroots. Further, in the vagina and
bladder have been found pencils, sticks of sealing-wax, empty
reels, bodkins, knitting-needles, needle-cases, compasses, glass
stoppers, candles, corks, tumblers, forks, toothpicks, pomade-boxes,
<span class="nowrap">cockchafers,<a id="FNanchor399"></a><a href="#Footnote399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></span>
hens&#8217; eggs, and, with especial frequency,
<b>hairpins</b>.</p>

<p>I may allude here, in passing, to the fact that C. Posner refers
the discovery of various bodies in the male urethra to other
causes than masturbation in some cases. He states that often
they have been introduced by other persons than the one in
whom they are found, and is of opinion that the introducer is
a man with sadistic tendencies, and usually homosexual (see
C. Posner, &#8220;The Introduction of Foreign Bodies into the Male
Urethra, with Remarks on the Psychology of such Cases,&#8221; published
in <i>Therapie der Gegenwart</i>, September, 1902). In the
year 1862 masturbation with the aid of hairpins was so widely
practised in Germany that a surgeon invented a special instrument
for the removal of hairpins from the female bladder! At
the present day this hairpin masturbation is extremely
<span class="nowrap">common.<a id="FNanchor400"></a><a href="#Footnote400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></span><span
class="pagenum" id="Page412">[412]</span>
Still more elaborate are artificial imitations of the male penis,
the so-called <i>godemich&eacute;s</i> (<i>gaude mihi</i>, <i>dildoes</i>, <i>consolateurs</i>,
&#8220;<i>bijoux indiscrets</i>,&#8221;
<span class="nowrap">etc.),<a id="FNanchor401"></a><a href="#Footnote401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></span>
of which we find representations in
ancient Babylonian sculpture, in Egypt, and in the &#8220;Mimiamben&#8221;
of <span class="nowrap">Herondas<a id="FNanchor402"></a><a href="#Footnote402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></span>
(third century before Christ); and since
very ancient times they have been in use in Eastern Asia, where
the Spaniards found them in the Philippines. Particularly well
known are the wax phalli of the Balinesian women. In Europe,
as early as the twelfth century, Bishop Burchard of Worms condemned
the use of artificial penes. Their use was especially
common at the time of the Italian renascence; the technique
of their employment became continually more elaborate. The
culmination was reached in the eighteenth century France. No
less a man than Mirabeau, the celebrated French politician, in his
erotic romance, &#8220;Le Rideau Lev&eacute;, ou l&#8217;Education de Laure,&#8221;
describes such an artificial phallus, and I append his description
in order to enable the reader to represent to himself the extremely
elaborate technique that was used in the application of
such auto-erotic instruments:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The instrument resembled in every respect the natural penis.
The only difference consisted in this, that from the apex to the root
it was shaped in transverse waves, in order to render the rubbing action
more powerful. Made entirely of silver, it was covered with a kind of
smooth and very hard varnish, giving it the natural colours. For the
rest, it was very light and thin, being hollow. Through the middle of
the hollow interior there passed a round tube, made also of silver, and
about twice the diameter of a goose-quill, and within this tube was
a piston; the tube was firmly closed at the other end by means of a
screw. This screw was perforated, and firmly soldered to the base of
the head. Consequently there was an empty space between the central
tube and the outer wall of the instrument. This outer cavity of the
godemich&eacute; was filled with water warmed to blood-heat, and then
closed with a well-fitting cork. The small central tube was filled with
a thin, whitish solution of isinglass (!), which was previously prepared.
The warmth of the water was immediately communicated to the
isinglass solution; and the latter then represented, as far as was
possible, the human semen.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This description dates from the year 1786! But even to-day
apparatus of this kind are advertised in the catalogues of certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page413">[413]</span>
traders, under the title of &#8220;Parisian Rubber Articles.&#8221; Whether
they really exist I do not know, for I have never actually seen
anything of the kind. Havelock Ellis assumes that they are still
used to-day. In brothels, prostitutes use at the present time
very primitive leathern phalli, such as were described by Herondas
and Aristophanes, for erotic practices and demonstration.</p>

<p>In addition to these, there are numerous other methods of
purely peripheral-mechanical masturbation. Thus, the rubbing
and movement of the genital organs in bicycle-riding, horse-riding,
very frequently in working the treadle of a sewing-machine,
and in travelling on the railway, may give rise to masturbatory
stimulation. Very commonly in women merely rubbing the
thighs against one another is sufficient to induce a sexual orgasm;
whereas men almost always need to have recourse to more powerful
manipulation, such as manual friction (<i>manustupratio</i>).</p>

<p>What are the general physiological <b>factors</b> of auto-erotic
phenomena, more especially of masturbation? In this connexion
it is interesting to note that <b>auto-erotism is almost always
a precursor of completely developed sexuality</b>, and manifests
itself a long time <b>before</b> puberty; and may even appear soon
after birth, for the older and more recent medical literature of
the subject contains numerous observations of masturbation in
<b>sucklings</b>, not to speak of masturbation in older children. The
auto-erotism of sucklings is <b>purely peripheral</b> in its nature, and
depends upon the mechanical stimulation of certain parts of the
body, the first &#8220;erogenic&#8221; zones of man. Freud enumerates
among the regions of the body by the stimulation of which sexual
pleasure is most readily obtained, the lips of the infant, which,
in sucking the mother&#8217;s breast or its substitute, receive an
instinctive perception of pleasure, in which the stimulation
produced by the warm flow of milk also plays a part. This
&#8220;ecstatic sucking&#8221; of infants is auto-erotic in character. Not
infrequently, while sucking in this voluptuous manner, the
infant simultaneously rubs certain sensitive parts of the body,
such as the breast and the external genital organs. A kind of
orgasm occurs, followed by sleep. Freud aptly compares this
phenomenon with the fact that in later life sexual gratification
is often the best means of inducing sleep. Freud also regards
the masturbation of sucklings as being within certain limits a
physiological phenomenon, as exhibiting on the part of Nature
an intention &#8220;to establish the future primacy of these erogenic
zones for sexual <span class="nowrap">activity.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor403"></a><a href="#Footnote403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page414">[414]</span></p>

<p>With the onset of puberty the auto-erotic instincts are newly
stimulated; new sources of auto-erotism become active, principally
owing to the development of the genital organs and to
the evacuation of the reproductive products. Various theories
have been propounded to explain by what means the <b>sexual
tension</b> occurring at puberty is induced, this sexual tension
being regarded as the ultimate cause of the masturbation of
sexually mature human beings. The most plausible hypothesis
is the <b>chemical</b> theory of sexual tension and sexual excitement,
which was explained in more detail above (<a href="#Page47">p. 47</a>). It may be
that, as Freud assumes, a substance generally diffused throughout
the organism is destroyed by the stimulation of the erogenic
zones, and that the products of decomposition of this substance
give rise to a discharge of sexual energy; it may be that the reproductive
organs themselves produce such chemical substances,
<b>sexual toxins</b>. This assumption is supported by the experimental
observation that when in animals the ovaries and all the
nerves connected with these organs have been removed, and consequently
the ordinary periodic recurrence of sexual activity is
no longer seen, if now ovarian extract is injected into the body
of such animals, rutting once more occurs. Starling introduced
the term &#8220;<b>hormone</b>&#8221; to denote these chemical sexual substances.
They appear also to play a part in connexion with certain abnormalities
and perversions of the sexual impulse&mdash;a matter to
which we shall return later. R. Kossmann also speaks of a
&#8220;<b>neuro-chemical</b>&#8221; injury&mdash;a kind of intoxication of the nervous
system induced by &#8220;retained secretions or excretions of the
reproductive <span class="nowrap">organs.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor404"></a><a href="#Footnote404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>The same author also advances the <b>neuro-mechanical</b> theory
of sexual tension. He understands by this that the purely
mechanical <b>distension</b> of the organs belonging to the reproductive
apparatus exercises a <b>mechanical stimulus</b> on the genital nerves,
and thus has a reflex action upon the centres of the brain and
spinal cord, which reflex stimulation is allayed by orgasm and
ejaculation. Haig explains the feeling of relief after masturbation,
and the consequent discharge of sexual tension, as rather dependent
upon the mechanism of the blood-pressure. He remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Since the sexual act gives rise to a low and falling blood-pressure,
it must necessarily alleviate conditions which are due to high and
increasing blood-pressure&mdash;for example, mental depression and ill-humour&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page415">[415]</span>
if my observations are correct, we have here an explanation
of the relation between conditions of high blood-pressure with
mental and physical depression, on the one hand, and masturbatory
practices on the other, for such practices alleviate this condition, and
are readily indulged in for this purpose&#8221; (quoted by Havelock Ellis).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The statement made to Dr. Garnier by a monk, thirty-three
years of age, bears out this view:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;If no nocturnal seminal emissions occur, the tension of the semen
gives rise to general depression, headache, and sleeplessness. I admit
that sometimes, in order to obtain relief, I lie upon the abdomen, and
so produce a seminal discharge. I immediately feel <b>freed</b>, as if a
<b>burden</b> had been lifted from me, and sleep returns&#8221; (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 273).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Similar motives for masturbation are alleged by many otherwise
healthy onanists. They apply, moreover, in an equal
degree to the normal, not excessive, sexual intercourse of ordinary
human beings. Persons belonging to the most diverse classes
of society&mdash;men of letters, shopmen, labourers, etc.&mdash;of whom
I have inquired regarding the effect of seminal emissions, whether
produced by masturbation or by coitus, have unanimously agreed
in describing to me this sense of &#8220;freeing&#8221; from a burden, from
pressure, from harmful substances accumulated in the body&mdash;a
sense of mental energy and creative power after such discharges
of sexual tension not exceeding normal limits. The frequency
of these discharges varies in different individuals; in one the
intervals were short, in another they were long. This point
has a very important bearing upon the &#8220;question of sexual
abstinence,&#8221; and we shall return to it in the discussion of that
topic.</p>

<p>Masturbation is often the means for inducing sleep and repose;
it dulls nervous sensibility, and connected with this is the fact
that <i>pain</i> is often allayed by masturbation. Here I may refer
once more to the previously quoted (<a href="#Page44">p. 44</a>) view of a talented young
alienist, Edmund Forster, that, in association with sexual tension,
there occurs an increased stimulation of the <b>pain-perceiving
nerves</b> of the genital organs. It is conceivable that sexual
tension, especially if it depends upon chemical causes, also increases
pains arising from other areas of the body, and that
the discharge of sexual tension would thus alleviate or completely
allay these pains. Coe reports (<i>American Journal of
Obstetrics</i>, 1889, p. 766) the case of a woman who was accustomed
by masturbation to obtain immediate relief of intense menstrual
ovarian pains. It is very remarkable that <b>these pains were
accompanied by a powerful sexual impulse</b>, which ceased when<span class="pagenum" id="Page416">[416]</span>
the pain ceased, and did not return during the intermenstrual
period. Here we have a striking testimony of the accuracy of
Forster&#8217;s view. The phrenologist Gall was aware of the manner
in which masturbation relieves pain.</p>

<p>In addition to these more natural causes of masturbation,
which in themselves suffice to explain the wide diffusion of the
practice, we have also to consider masturbation dependent upon
<b>seduction</b> and upon <b>morbid states</b>.</p>

<p>To seduction must be referred all the phenomena of <b>group-masturbation</b>
(masturbation on the large scale) in
<span class="nowrap"><b>schools</b>,<a id="FNanchor405"></a><a href="#Footnote405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></span>
training-ships, barracks, factories (especially in this case as
regards female employees!), prisons, etc. One leads another
astray, and masturbation is diffused like an epidemic disease;
the individuals are subjected to the influence of the <b>suggestion
of the crowd</b>, which they are unable to resist. Thomalla describes
boarding-schools in which masturbation was practised for a
wager, and that boy won the prize in whom seminal emission
first occurred! He further speaks of a school club in which
obscene readings were held, and in which by means of forbidden
pictures the boys were sexually excited until erection occurred,
then followed general masturbation, also accompanied by wagers.</p>

<p>This group-masturbation is the best proof of the fact that those
who masturbate are not simply individuals with an inherited
morbid predisposition; for nothing is easier to suggest than
masturbation. Havelock <span class="nowrap">Ellis<a id="FNanchor406"></a><a href="#Footnote406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></span>
reports the following case of
an unmarried healthy young woman, thirty-one years of age,
which throws a strong light on this suggested manifestation:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;When I was about twenty-six years of age, a female friend informed
me that she had masturbated already for several years, and
was so much enslaved by the habit that she suffered seriously from
its ill-effects. I listened to her account with sympathy and interest,
but felt rather sceptical, <b>and I resolved to make the attempt on myself</b>,
with the intention of understanding the matter better, so that I might
be able to help my friend. With a little trouble I <b>succeeded in awakening
what had hitherto slumbered in me unknown</b>. I intentionally
allowed the habit to become stronger, and one night&mdash;for I usually
did it just before going to sleep, never in the morning&mdash;I really experienced
an extremely agreeable sensation. But the next morning my
conscience was aroused, and I felt pains also in the back of the head
and along the spine. For a time I discontinued the habit, but later
began it again, masturbating with considerable regularity once a
month, a few days after each menstruation.... The habit overcame<span class="pagenum" id="Page417">[417]</span>
me with alarming rapidity, and I soon became more or less its slave....
In conclusion, I must say that masturbation has proved to me
one of the blind chances in my life&#8217;s history, out of which I have derived
many valuable experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frequently local morbid changes in or near the genital
organs lead to the practice of masturbation, such as skin
troubles, intestinal worms, phimosis, inflammatory states of
the penis or near the entrance of the vagina, prurigo and
other itching affections of the penis, constipation, urinary
anomalies, etc. Further, mental disorders, epilepsy, and degenerative
nerve troubles, are frequent causes of masturbation.
Masturbation has been observed after epileptic paroxysms in
patients who at other times never masturbate. There is no
doubt that neurasthenia powerfully predisposes to masturbation.
<b>Excessive</b> masturbation is almost always the consequence, not
the cause, of associated neurasthenia; it is &#8220;the manifestation
of a disease in course of development or of a permanently
existing degenerative
<span class="nowrap">predisposition.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor407"></a><a href="#Footnote407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></span>
To these cases of invincible,
habitual, excessive masturbation Oppenheim&#8217;s view
applies&mdash;that the disposition to onanism is often <b>inherited</b>. A
characteristic instance of this is offered by an observation of
Block&#8217;s (Havelock Ellis, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 240) in the case of a little
girl, who began to masturbate at the early age of two years, and
had probably inherited this tendency from her mother and
grandmother, for they had both masturbated throughout life,
whilst the grandmother had actually died in an asylum of &#8220;masturbatory
insanity.&#8221; In the majority of cases in which <b>masturbation
makes its first appearance in sucklings</b> we have to do
with such an inheritance. In many cases the peculiar oscillatory
movements of sucklings may merely be the expression of the
sense of general comfort, as F&uuml;rbringer believes, and may have
nothing to do with actual masturbation; but, on the other hand,
it cannot be denied that veritable masturbation may be observed
in the first and second years of life. Havelock Ellis, J. P. West,
and Louis Mayer have reported such cases. In children somewhat
older than this&mdash;from three years upwards&mdash;seduction and
suggestion certainly play a great part. The author of &#8220;Splitter&#8221;
was told by a professor that, when visiting an institution for
small children in St. G[allen], he saw a girl about three years of
age who was making suspicious movements. The matron, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page418">[418]</span>
attention was called to the matter, said that almost all babies
were already infected when they first came to the institution
(&#8220;Splitter,&#8221; p. 375).</p>

<p>Another disputed question relates to the <b>diffusion of masturbation
in the female sex</b>. Is the practice commoner or less
common among women than among men?
<span class="nowrap">Metchnikoff<a id="FNanchor408"></a><a href="#Footnote408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></span> is of
opinion that in girls it is much less common than in boys, because
sexual excitability generally develops much later in the female
sex. Female monkeys masturbate only in exceptional cases,
whereas in male monkeys masturbation is very common. The
circumstance which Metchnikoff adduces in further support of
his view of the rarity of masturbation in women&mdash;that, namely,
most girls are enlightened regarding sexual sensibility only after
marriage&mdash;proves very little, because the sensations aroused in
woman by masturbation are of a very different nature from those
produced by coitus, and coitus often first makes them acquainted
with entirely new sensations. Tissot regards masturbation as
commoner in women than in men; Deslandes believed that there
was no difference between the sexes. Lawson Tait, Spitzka, and
Dana, inclined rather to Metchnikoff&#8217;s view as to the greater
rarity of the practice among women. Albert Eulenburg considers
masturbation &#8220;not quite so common among young women
as among young men,&#8221; but still &#8220;far more common than parents,
teachers, and the laity of both sexes as a rule
<span class="nowrap">imagine.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor409"></a><a href="#Footnote409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></span> Havelock
Ellis considers that <b>after</b> puberty masturbation is commoner in
women because men can then much more readily obtain gratification
in a normal manner by means of intercourse with the other
sex. Otto Adler estimates the frequency of masturbation to be
very great, because he regards it as the principal cause of deficient
sexual sensibility in women, which latter condition he also
believes to be extremely common, although he does not go so far
as to accept Rohleder&#8217;s enormous proportion of 95 masturbators
in every 100 women <span class="nowrap">(!).<a id="FNanchor410"></a><a href="#Footnote410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></span>
L. L&ouml;wenfeld, who characterizes
Rohleder&#8217;s and Berger&#8217;s (99&nbsp;%) estimates as exaggerations, considers
that the frequency of masturbation in women is not so
great as in <span class="nowrap">men.<a id="FNanchor411"></a><a href="#Footnote411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></span>
In reality, masturbation, given similar circumstances
and causes, is probably diffused to an approximately
equal extent among both sexes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page419">[419]</span></p>

<p>But this relates only to peripheral-mechanical masturbation;
from this &#8220;<b>psychical onanism</b>&#8221; has rightly been separated&mdash;that
form of masturbation in which, simply by ideas, without the
assistance of manual stimulation of the genital organs, sexual
excitement is caused and the orgasm is induced. Psychical
onanism, of which Eduard <span class="nowrap">Reich<a id="FNanchor412"></a><a href="#Footnote412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></span>
remarked that our own time
nourishes it to the fullest possible extent, develops in the majority
of cases out of masturbation proper. In this form the <b>imagination</b>
is tasked with representing all the factors of normal sexual
gratification. The simple physical act suffices only in the first
beginnings of this vice. Every practised onanist understands
that he must soon call his imagination to his aid in order to
produce sexual gratification, and that ultimately ideas alone
dominate the entire libido, and the orgasm often enough terminates
an act which in every respect has throughout remained
purely ideal.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;So great is the power of imagination,&#8221; remarks the experienced
Rouband, &#8220;that quite alone, without the assistance of physical
stimulation, it can produce the venereal orgasm, with ejaculation of
the semen, as happened to one of my fellow-students every time he
thought of his <span class="nowrap">beloved.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor413"></a><a href="#Footnote413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Hammond even knew an actual sect of such &#8220;onanists by
means of simple ideal unchastity,&#8221; who formed a sort of club or
society, and who were known to one another by certain
<span class="nowrap">signs.<a id="FNanchor414"></a><a href="#Footnote414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></span>
A patient related to him that in his thoughts of women whom he
met, or those who were sitting opposite to him in the railway-carriage,
he was accustomed to undress them in imagination;
he then would represent to himself very plainly their genital
organs, and during this representation he experienced very active
voluptuous sensations, culminating in ejaculation. L&ouml;wenfeld
has also observed several such cases. Eulenburg speaks of an
&#8220;ideal cohabitation.&#8221; The ideas are usually of a lascivious
nature, but this is not always the case. Von Schrenck-Notzing
reports the case of a lady twenty years of age in whom the
simple idea of men, but also agreeable sensory perceptions, such
as theatrical scenes, or musical impressions, or beautiful pictures,
gave rise to the sexual <span class="nowrap">orgasm.<a id="FNanchor415"></a><a href="#Footnote415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page420">[420]</span></p>

<p>Allied with psychical onanism is the brooding over sexual
ideas&mdash;the <i>delectatio morosa</i> of the theologians&mdash;and erotic excitement
associated with dream-imaginations, or &#8220;sexual day-dreams&#8221;
(Havelock Ellis). This is the spinning out of a continuous
erotic history with any hero or any heroine, which is
carried on from day to day. Most commonly this occurs in bed
before going to sleep. Sexual activities form the material of
these histories. We often find carefully worked out and more or
less erotic day-dreams in young men, and especially in young
women, frequently containing perverse elements. This dreaming,
according to Havelock Ellis, does not necessarily lead to
masturbation, although it often induces seminal discharges. It
occurs both in healthy and in abnormal persons, especially in
imaginative individuals. Rousseau experienced such erotic day-dreams.
The American author Garland, in his novel, &#8220;Rose of
Dutcher&#8217;s Coolly,&#8221; has admirably described the part played by a
circus-rider in the erotic day-dreams of a <b>normal healthy girl</b>
during the <b>period of</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>puberty</b>.<a id="FNanchor416"></a><a href="#Footnote416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>In close relationship with these psychical-onanistic day-dreams
there stands another phenomenon, to which, as far as
I know, I was the first to refer, which I have denoted by
the term <span class="nowrap"><b>erotographomania</b>.<a id="FNanchor417"></a><a href="#Footnote417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></span>
There are numerous men and
women who induce their lovers&mdash;male or female, as the case may
be&mdash;prostitutes, masseuses, etc., to write to them <b>letters</b> with a
sexually stimulating content; or also, as very frequently occurs,
they themselves write such letters, containing numerous obscenities.
Such correspondence, filled with ardent erotism,
seems recently to have made its appearance as a peculiar refinement
of sexuality; this also has the effect of a kind of psychical
onanism. The interchange of obscene letters of this character
recently played a part in the trial of two homosexual individuals
in East Prussia. There exists, also, a comparatively blameless,
more or less physiological, erotographomania of the time of
puberty, in which most passionate letters are written to imaginary
lovers, and the still obscure sexual impulse finds a satisfaction
in these erotic imaginations.</p>

<p>After this brief account of the various forms and varieties of
masturbation, we now turn to consider the <b>consequences</b> of the
practice. In the course of time there has been a remarkable
change of views in respect of this matter. The true founder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page421">[421]</span>
the scientific literature of masturbation, Tissot, in his celebrated
monograph (&#8220;Masturbation; or, the Treatment of the Diseases
that result from Self-Abuse&#8221;; St. Petersburg, 1774), regarded
masturbation as the evil of all evils, and deduced from it all
possible severe troubles. His book bears as motto the verse by
Von Canitz:</p>

<p class="noindent">It is dominated by a thoroughgoing pessimism. In this view
he is followed by Voltaire, in his &#8220;Dictionnaire Philosophique,&#8221;
and by the authors of the first seventy years of the nineteenth
century. Such gloomy views are expressed, above all,
by Lallemand, in his celebrated book upon involuntary losses of
semen; but they are shared by German physicians also, as, for
example, B. Hermann Leitner, in his treatise, &#8220;<i>De Masturbatione</i>&#8221;
(Buda-Pesth, 1844), and in the preface to his book
we read: &#8220;The writers who speak of the terrible results of self-abuse
do not exaggerate; on the contrary, their picture is not
sufficiently <span class="nowrap">gloomy.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor418"></a><a href="#Footnote418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></span>
Modern medical science has, however,
reduced these exaggerations to a reasonable measure. For this
we have, above all, to thank W. Erb and F&uuml;rbringer. The old
belief in the enormous dangers and the eminent injuriousness of
masturbation, still remains as a bugbear in certain popular
writings, some of which have been published in hundreds of
editions. Who has not heard of the &#8220;Selbstbewahrung&#8221; (&#8220;Self-Abuse&#8221;)
of <span class="nowrap">Retaus,<a id="FNanchor419"></a><a href="#Footnote419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></span>
the prototype of this dangerous literature,
which must be regarded as the principal source of sexual hypochondria;
frequently, also, it induces direct sexual stimulation,
because it does indeed describe the devil, but describes also
voluptuousness!</p>

<p>At the present day all experienced physicians who have been
occupied in the study of masturbation and its consequences hold
the view that <b>moderate</b> masturbation in healthy persons, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page422">[422]</span>
morbid inheritance, has no bad results at all. It is only excess
that does harm; but even excess in healthy persons does less
harm than in those with inherited morbid predisposition. I may
express the matter in this way: it is not masturbation (Ger.
<i>Onanie</i>) that is harmful, but &#8220;<b>onanism</b>&#8221; (Ger. <i>Onanismus</i>)&mdash;that
is to say, the habitual and excessive practice of masturbation,
continued for a number of years, <b>which certainly has an
injurious influence on health</b>. The boundary line at which the
harmless masturbation (<i>Onanie</i>) ceases and the injurious onanism
(<i>Onanismus</i>) begins cannot generally be defined. The difference
between individuals makes their reactions in this respect very
different. For example, Curschmann reports the case of a
talented and brilliant author who, notwithstanding the fact that
he had masturbated to excess for eleven years, remained physically
and mentally vigorous, and pursued his literary labours
with notable success. F&uuml;rbringer reports a similar case in a
University lecturer. The following case, which came under my
own observation, shows that even excessive masturbation need
not impair health and working powers. A man of letters, forty
years of age, probably misled by a nursemaid in the first instance,
had masturbated without intermission since the age of five, and
since puberty had done so <b>several times a day</b> (three to ten
times), without any interference with his powers for work. He
is a big, powerful, healthy man, of a really imposing appearance.
No one would suspect him to be a habitual masturbator. That
from the masturbation (Ger. <i>Onanie</i>) of childhood and youth there
developed a condition of formal onanism (Ger. <i>Onanismus</i>) in
the adult is in this case principally to be ascribed to the continued
abuse of alcohol. The patient drinks daily twelve to
fourteen glasses of Munich beer. He is also a heavy smoker.
No evidence of inherited predisposition to masturbation can be
obtained. For the patient the female sex exists only in the
imagination; he has very rarely had sexual intercourse, and
avoids ladies&#8217; society, although he has good fortune with women.
It is the same with masturbation as it is with sexual intercourse:
the effects vary according to the individual. Recently masturbation
and coitus have been compared in this respect. Sir James
Paget in his lecture on &#8220;Sexual Hypochondriasis&#8221; says: &#8220;Masturbation
does neither more nor less harm than sexual intercourse
practised with the same frequency in the same conditions
of general health and age and circumstance.&#8221; Erb and Curschmann
go even further; for they consider that masturbation has
less influence on the nervous system than coitus. <b>In reality</b>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page423">[423]</span>
however, masturbation is almost always more harmful than
coitus. The reasons for this are obvious. In the first place,
masturbation is begun much earlier, generally at an age when the
body has not yet developed any marked capacity for resistance.
Masturbation in childhood is, therefore, especially
<span class="nowrap">harmful.<a id="FNanchor420"></a><a href="#Footnote420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></span>
L&ouml;wenfeld (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 127) is of opinion that self-abuse begun
before virility is attained more readily gives rise to weakness of
the nervous system than masturbation begun later in life. In
neuropathic children he saw several times, as a consequence of
masturbation, well-marked general nervousness, paroxysms of
anxiety, sleeplessness, and arrest of mental development. In the
second place, masturbation is more dangerous than coitus in
this way&mdash;that it can be carried out <b>much more frequently</b>, on
account of the more frequent opportunities, so that masturbation
four, five, or even more, times in a <b>single</b> day is by no means rare.
In the third place, the <b>spiritual influence</b> of masturbation is much
more harmful than that of normal coitus. The &#8220;solitary&#8221; vice
influences the psyche and the character in the mere child. The
youthful masturbator seeks solitude, becomes shy of human
beings, reserved, morose, unhappy, hypochondriacal. In the
adult the sense of the debasing character and of the sinfulness of
masturbation is much more lively; self-confidence departs; the
masturbator regards himself as absolutely &#8220;<b>enslaved</b>&#8221; by his
vice, the eternal <b>struggle</b> against the ever-recurring impulse gives
rise more to mental depression than to actual physical harm.
From this there results a whole series of diseases of the will, for
by masturbation much less harm is done to the intellect than to
the vital energy, the capacity for spiritual and physical activity.
The cold, blas&eacute; manner of many young men, who seem never to
have known the natural youthful joy of life, the whole &#8220;demi-virginity&#8221;
of modern young girls&mdash;all these are without doubt
dependent upon masturbation and upon psychical onanism.
The egoism of the onanist in the sexual relationship increases
his egoism in other respects, gives rise to cold-heartedness, and
blunts the more delicate ethical perceptions. The campaign
against masturbation as a group manifestation is eminently a
<i>social</i> campaign for altruism; it insists that young people should
take their share in all questions relating to the common good.
Peculiar extravagances and unnatural characteristics in art and
literature may also be partly attributed to masturbation. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page424">[424]</span>
works clearly bear its imprints. Thus Havelock Ellis rightly
refers in this connexion to the peculiar melancholy in Gogol&#8217;s
stories, for Gogol masturbated to great excess. It would be
possible to mention also certain writings of our own time which
inevitably give rise to such a suspicion.</p>

<p>The reader will do well to consult the interesting discussion of
masturbation from the philosophical standpoint by Schopenhauer
(&#8220;Neue Paralipomena,&#8221; ed. Grisebach, pp. 226, 227).</p>

<p>The <b>physical</b> consequences of immoderate and habitual masturbation
may also be really serious. The <b>eye</b> especially suffers
manifold injuries, as has been proved by the investigations of
Hermann Cohn. Irritable states of the conjunctiva, spasms of
the eyelids, weakness of accommodation, subjective sensations of
light, and photophobia, may result from masturbation. The
<b>heart</b> also is sympathetically affected. Krehl even speaks of
&#8220;<b>masturbator&#8217;s heart</b>&#8221; as a consequence of the long-lasting
nervous hyperexcitability, which injures the heart and the
vessels, and is manifested by irregularity of the pulse and by
sensations of pressure and pain in the cardiac region, by palpitation,
etc. Discontinuance of the habit leads to an immediate
disappearance of all these alarming symptoms. Very important
is also the causal connexion between masturbation and <b>nervous</b>
or <b>mental disorders</b>. Here, however, as Aschaffenburg has recently
insisted, we must distinguish clearly between masturbation
<b>resulting</b> from previously existing nervo-psychical troubles, in
which a vicious circle develops&mdash;for here the masturbation is
partly the consequence of the original trouble, partly the cause
of an aggravation of this trouble&mdash;and the effects of onanism
on the <b>healthy</b> central nervous system. Here Aschaffenburg is
in agreement with the views of those who consider these effects
are less serious than earlier writers were accustomed to assume.
Aschaffenburg also recognizes that the most harmful effect is
to be found in the <b>psychical</b> influence of masturbation, in the
continuous, but ever-vain, contest against the habit. This is
the source of the majority of the hypochondriacal and other
troubles. He often succeeded, by the discovery of this psychical
mode of origin, in putting an end to a number of morbid manifestations.
As soon as the patient <b>becomes aware</b> that these have
a purely mental cause, he at once feels himself freed from them.
That masturbation is <b>never</b> a direct cause of mental disorder is
now generally recognized by
<span class="nowrap">alienists.<a id="FNanchor421"></a><a href="#Footnote421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></span> At the most, masturbation
is no more than a favouring element in the production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page425">[425]</span>
such disorder. &#8220;<b>Masturbatory insanity</b>&#8221; occurs only in those with
marked hereditary predisposition, and who already have been
extremely <span class="nowrap">neurasthenic.<a id="FNanchor422"></a><a href="#Footnote422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>But masturbation can unquestionably give rise to <b>purely
local changes</b> in the genital organs, such as <b>inflammatory states
of the prostate gland</b>, <b>spermatorrh&#339;a</b>, and <b>prostatorrh&#339;a</b>; in
women <b>fluor albus</b>, <b>excessively painful menstruation</b>, and <b>other
disturbances of the menstrual function</b>, and in connexion with
these phenomena there may appear the morbid picture of
&#8220;<b>sexual neurasthenia</b>,&#8221; which we have soon to describe.</p>

<p>A very serious result of onanism (not of <i>Onanie</i>) is the
<b>disinclination to normal sexual intercourse</b> to which the habit
gives rise, and the <b>production of sexual perversions</b>. The former
is more marked in the female sex, the latter more in the male
sex. Masturbation is the principal cause of sexual frigidity in
women and of a disinclination to normal intercourse. Undoubtedly
psychical influences here play the principal part;
but also a certain blunting of the sensations of the genital organs
by means of excessive masturbatory stimulation. They are no
longer susceptible to the normal stimulatory influence of coitus.
Moreover, masturbation is often effected by stimulation applied
to <b>some definite portion</b> of the female reproductive organs, most
frequently to the clitoris or the labia; and these parts in such
cases are not sufficiently stimulated by coitus. In the male the
especially sensitive portions of the penis are stimulated alike by
masturbation and in coitus, for which reason man, notwithstanding
the practice of masturbation, is much more readily able to obtain
sexual gratification in the course of ordinary sexual intercourse.
Notwithstanding this, there are also certain peculiar methods of
masturbation in the male, the effect of which is not attained by
coitus. In such cases men also may fail to induce the sexual
orgasm by ordinary intercourse.</p>

<p>The close relationship of masturbation to sexual perversions
is obvious. The more frequently the onanistic act is repeated,
the more the normal sensibility is blunted, the stronger and more
peculiar are the stimuli, which must be of a nature diverging from
the ordinary, demanded in order to induce a sexual orgasm.
The content of the lascivious ideas must be varied more and
more frequently, and soon passes entirely into the sphere of the
perverse. Gradually these perverse sexual ideas become more
firmly rooted, and ultimately develop into complete sexual
<b>perversions</b>. A classical example of this is the case reported by<span class="pagenum" id="Page426">[426]</span>
<span class="nowrap">Tardieu<a id="FNanchor423"></a><a href="#Footnote423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></span>
of a man who was in the habit of <b>masturbating seven
or eight times every day</b>, and ultimately inflamed his imagination
to the point of representing the act of intercourse with female
corpses. At length he passed to the <b>practical carrying out</b> of
this horrible idea, which had now assumed definite sadistic
characters. He arranged to obtain a view of opened female
bodies, killed dogs, dug up human corpses&mdash;all in order thereby
to provide satisfaction for his imagination, which had been disordered
in consequence of masturbation, and thus to obtain
sexual gratification. In the etiology of pseudo-homosexuality
masturbation unquestionably plays a part&mdash;a fact to which
Havelock Ellis has drawn <span class="nowrap">attention.<a id="FNanchor424"></a><a href="#Footnote424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></span>
The Mexican &#8220;mujerados&#8221;
are trained for p&aelig;derasty by means of masturbation repeated
several times daily. Ideas of bestial intercourse may even be
aroused by masturbation. Von
<span class="nowrap">Schrenck-Notzing<a id="FNanchor425"></a><a href="#Footnote425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></span> reports the
case of a woman who had masturbated for thirty years, and
ultimately came to represent to herself in imagination that she
was having intercourse with a stallion.</p>

<p>The prospects of the satisfactory <b>treatment</b> and <b>cure</b> of masturbation
are unquestionably greater in the case of children. To
attain perfect success, parents, teachers, and physicians must
co-operate. Above all, it is necessary to relieve any local and
general morbid conditions favouring the practice of masturbation.
The diet should be light and unstimulating, the clothing and
bedding light and cool. In the year 1791 the body physician of
the Schaumburg-Lippe family, Dr. Bernhard Christian Faust,
published a remarkable work under the title &#8220;How to Regulate
the Human Sexual Impulse,&#8221; with a preface by the celebrated
pedagogue J. H. Campe (Brunswick, 1791). In this book he
maintained the thesis that the principal cause of masturbation
in boys was the wearing of <b>breeches</b>. According to him, the
<b>wrapping up</b> of children in swaddling clothes causes premature
stimulation of the sexual organs. Later, in consequence of
wearing breeches, there is produced &#8220;a great and damp warmth,
which is especially marked in the region of the sexual organs,
where the shirt falls into folds&#8221; (p. 46). Also, the boy, &#8220;when
he wishes to pass water, must take his little penis out of his
breeches. At first, and for a long time after he begins to wear
them, the little boy cannot manage this himself; other children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page427">[427]</span>
maids, and menservants, help him, and pull and play with his
sexual parts. By this handling, pulling, and playing, which he
himself does, or which others do for him, with his sexual organs,
the boy is led (also the girl, who very often assists, and whom the
blameless boy, out of gratitude, wishes to help in return) into
constant acquaintanceship with parts which he would otherwise
have regarded as sacred, unclean, and shameful. The child
becomes accustomed to play with his sexual organs, and <b>occasional
masturbation</b> develops into habitual self-abuse, <b>all brought
about by wearing breeches</b>&#8221; (p. 45). To prevent all this, he
suggested that boys from nine to fourteen years of age should
wear clothing resembling rather that of girls. Then these children
would be &#8220;according to Nature, children, and would ripen
late; and the human sexual impulse would come under control,
and mankind would be better and happier&#8221; (p. 217).</p>

<p>Although the far-reaching and systematic development of this
thesis appears ludicrous, still, there is an element of truth in it,
and unsuitably tight and warm clothing certainly favours the
tendency to masturbation.</p>

<p>According to the suggestion of Ultzmann, in the case of nursing
infants and of small children, the hands may be confined in little
bags or tied to the side of the bed. The methods of the older
physicians, who appeared before the child armed with great
knives and scissors, and threatened a painful operation, or even
to cut off the genital organs, may often be found useful, and may
effect a radical cure. The <b>actual</b> carrying out of small operations
is also sometimes helpful. F&uuml;rbringer cured a young fellow in
whom no instruction and no punishment had proved effective,
by simply cutting off the anterior part of his foreskin with jagged
scissors. In the case of a young lady who often in company
indulged her passionate impulse towards masturbation, he
brought about a cure by repeated cauterization of the vulva.
Other physicians perforate the foreskin and introduce a ring.
Cages have even been provided for the genital organs to prevent
masturbation, the key being kept by the father (!). Enveloping
the penis in bandages without any opening has also been tried.
Corporal punishment sometimes has a good effect. Of the
greatest value is <b>continuous care, to safeguard the children
against seduction</b>. &#8220;Parents, protect your children from servants,&#8221;
exclaimed R&eacute;tif de la Bretonne. Valuable also are
<b>earnest warnings and explanations</b>, <b>increase of energy and force
of will</b> (by sports and games, and by work in the garden, and by
the setting of tasks which stimulate ambition). <b>Climatic cures</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page428">[428]</span>
and <b>hydro-therapeutic methods</b> are also valuable means in the
treatment of masturbation. The same measures may be employed
in the treatment of masturbation in <b>adults</b>. In their
case, however, <b>psycho-therapeutics</b> plays the principal part. In
many cases here also local cauterization of the urethra and
massage of the prostate may bring about a cure. <b>Utterly perverse</b>
would it be to introduce youthful onanists to actual
sexual intercourse, after the manner of the Parisian &#8220;soup-merchants,&#8221;
as the common speech names them, who, in order
to cure their youthful scholars of masturbation, take them into
<span class="nowrap">brothels.<a id="FNanchor426"></a><a href="#Footnote426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></span></p>

<p class="blankbefore1">Masturbation is intimately connected with <b>irritable nervous
weakness</b>, or &#8220;<b>neurasthenia</b>,&#8221; this typical disease of civilization,
and more especially with the genital form of the disease,
&#8220;<b>sexual neurasthenia</b>.&#8221; In an analysis of 333 cases of neurasthenia
Collins and Philipp found that 123 cases&mdash;that is, more
than one-third&mdash;resulted from overwork or from
<span class="nowrap">masturbation.<a id="FNanchor427"></a><a href="#Footnote427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></span>
Freud, von Krafft-Ebing, Savill, Gattel, and Rohleder see in
masturbation the true cause of neurasthenia. F&uuml;rbringer,
L&ouml;wenfeld, and Eulenburg are of opinion that other injuries must
also come into play in order to produce the typical picture of
sexual neurasthenia. It is certain that very frequently the order
of causation is reversed, <b>neurasthenia</b> being the <b>primary</b> and
masturbation the secondary disorder. Masturbation is then only
a <b>symptom</b> of sexual neurasthenia. The same duplex mode of
consideration may also be applied to the other morbid phenomena
of which the clinical picture of sexual neurasthenia is composed.
Every one of these symptoms of irritable weakness, the excessive
sexual excitability, the deficient sexual sensibility, the seminal
discharges, and the impotence, can, like masturbation, exhibit a
certain <b>independence</b>, can be induced by various causes, and may
lead to sexual neurasthenia; it may be, on the other hand, that
they first developed in the soil of sexual neurasthenia. It is often
impossible to determine the true <b>beginning</b> of the vicious circle.
It therefore appears to be more practical to describe the morbid
picture of sexual neurasthenia (which we owe to
<span class="nowrap">Beard)<a id="FNanchor428"></a><a href="#Footnote428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></span> according
to its individual symptoms, as is done also by A.

in an admirable essay, and by L. L&ouml;wenfeld in his well-known
work on &#8220;The Sexual Life and Nervous Disorders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <b>abnormal increase in the sexual impulse</b> (<b>sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia</b>,
<b>satyriasis</b>, <b>nymphomania</b>) begins at the point at which the
normal sexual impulse is exceeded; and that point is subject to
wide individual variations, according to the age, race, habits,
and external influences. The normal sexual impulse can also
be temporarily increased by special circumstances&mdash;as, for
example, by prolonged sexual abstinence, and by various kinds
of erotic stimulation, without our being justified in speaking of
&#8220;hyper&aelig;sthesia.&#8221; This is always an abnormal condition, which
may be referred to various causes. It is more frequent in men
(&#8220;satyriasis&#8221;) than in women (&#8220;nymphomania&#8221;); it may be
permanent or periodic; it almost always arises from lascivious
<b>ideas</b>, and, according to its cause, is accompanied by a greater
or less diminution of responsibility, or even by complete lack of
responsibility. The readiness with which sexual ideas give rise
to an abnormally increased desire and to reaction on the part of
the genital apparatus is characteristic of sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia;
and this may attain such a degree that the man (or woman) may
really be &#8220;sexually insane,&#8221; and, like the wild animals, rush at
the first creature he meets of the opposite sex in order to gratify
his lust; or he may be overpowered by some abnormal variety
of the sexual impulse, so that he seizes in sexual embrace any
other living or lifeless object, and in this state may perform acts
of p&aelig;derasty, bestiality, violation of children, etc. In these
most severe cases we can always demonstrate the existence of
mental disorder, general paralysis, mania, or periodical insanity,
and very often of <b>epilepsy</b> (Lombroso), as a cause. In a more
chronic and milder form, sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia is observed after
excessive masturbation, often also in association with a congenitally
neuropathic constitution. L&ouml;wenfeld describes a peculiar
form of <b>nocturnal</b> sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia occurring in married
men, especially men in the forties or fifties, who for various
reasons are compelled to abstain from conjugal intercourse, and
who live continently. <b>In the daytime</b> these patients were free
from their trouble; it appeared only at <b>night</b>. Soon, or some
hours after going to sleep, a <b>violent, painful, enduring erection
of the penis</b> (<b>priapism</b>) set in, which disturbed their sleep, and
left them in the morning with a feeling of enervation. In such
a case obviously there is a hyperexcitability of the genital erection
centre. The erection results as a reflex effect of stimuli proceeding
from the genital organs, but manifests itself only when,<span class="pagenum" id="Page430">[430]</span>
during sleep, the inhibitions proceeding from the brain are in
abeyance. This nocturnal priapism may, according to L&ouml;wenfeld&#8217;s
observations, last for <span class="nowrap">years.<a id="FNanchor430"></a><a href="#Footnote430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>Sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia in women, or &#8220;<b>nymphomania</b>,&#8221; is, in
its slighter forms, also in most cases a consequence of excessive
masturbation. Such women do not so much exhibit a more
powerful inclination towards sexual intercourse, which, on the
contrary, is incompetent to satisfy their abnormal and perverse
sexual excitability. We rather see in them an impulsion to
obtain new sensations in their sexual organs in any possible way.
These are the women who, for example, consult the gyn&aelig;cologist
as often as possible, because examination with the speculum or
other manipulations induce in them sexual excitement. During
the climacteric&mdash;the time when menstruation ceases&mdash;such states
are also met with. Nymphomania proper always develops
upon the foundation of severe neurasthenia and hysteria, or of
direct brain and mental disorder. Then is produced the type of
the &#8220;<b>man-mad</b>&#8221; woman, as described by Juvenal in the person
of the Empress Messalina, who in the brothel gave herself to all
comers, without obtaining complete satisfaction of her sexual
desire. Such types exist also at the present day. Thus, the
brothers de Goncourt in their Diary reported the case of an old
housekeeper who for several decades indulged in the most lascivious
love orgies, had innumerable lovers, and a &#8220;secret life
full of nocturnal orgies in strange beds, full of nymphomaniac
<span class="nowrap">lusts.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor431"></a><a href="#Footnote431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></span>
There recently lived in Charlottenburg the wife of a
workman, well known on account of her incredible sexual
ardour and man-mania. Her husband, a professional stabber,
was imprisoned for life. His wife often gave herself in a single
day to four or five different men; every male creature that
approached her she asked to perform the sexual act with her.&mdash;The
following almost incredible case of this nature is reported by
Tr&eacute;lat:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Madame V., of a strong constitution, agreeable exterior, good-natured
manner, but very reserved, came under the care of Tr&eacute;lat on
January 1, 1854. Notwithstanding the fact that she was sixty years
of age, she still worked very diligently, and hardly spared herself time
for meals. Nothing in her outward appearance or in her actions
indicated during her stay in the asylum that she was in any way
affected with mental disorder. During the four years not a single
obscene word, not a gesture, not the slightest passionate movement,
indicated anger or impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page431">[431]</span></p>

<p>Since her earliest years she has pursued handsome men and given
herself to them. When a young girl, by this degrading conduct she
reduced her parents to despair. Of an amiable character, she blushed
when anyone spoke a word to her. She cast her eyes down when in
the presence of several persons; but as soon as she was alone with a
young or old man, or even with a child, she was immediately transformed;
she lifted her petticoats, and attacked with a raging energy
him who was the object of her insane love. In such moments she
was a Messalina, whereas a few instants before one would have regarded
her as a virgin. A few times she met with resistance, and received
severe moral lectures, but far more often there was no obstacle to
her desires. Although various distressing adventures occurred, her
parents arranged for her marriage, in the hope thereby to put an end
to the moral disturbance. But her marriage was only a new scandal.
She loved her husband passionately; and she loved with the like
passion every man with whom she happened to be alone; and she
exhibited so much cunning and cleverness that she made a mock of
any attempts at watching her, and often attained her end. Now it
was a manual worker busy at his trade, now some one walking past
her in the street, to whom she spoke, and whom she brought home
with her on any possible excuse&mdash;a young man, a servant, a child
returning from school! In her exterior she appeared so blameless,
and she spoke so gently, that every one followed her without mistrust.
More than once she was beaten or robbed; but this did not
prevent her continuing the same way of life. Even when she had
become a grandmother there was no change.</p>

<p>One day she enticed a boy, twelve years of age, into her house,
having told him that his mother was coming to see her. She gave him
sweets, embraced and kissed him, and as she then began to take off
his clothes and approached him with obscene gestures, the boy strove
to resist her. He struck her, and he related everything to his brother,
twenty-four years of age. The brother entered the house pointed out
by the boy, and abused the corrupt woman to the uttermost, saying:
&#8220;In such circumstances one helps oneself, without having recourse to
law, in order not to bring one&#8217;s name into disrepute by public proceedings.
I hope this disturbance will teach you not to behave in
this way again.&#8221; While this scene was going on, the woman&#8217;s son-in-law
chanced to come in, realized the situation before there was time
to tell him anything, and at once took sides with the incensed young
man.</p>

<p>She was shut up in a convent, where she behaved in so good, sweet,
amiable, and modest a manner, that no one would have believed that
she had ever committed the slightest fault, and representations were
made to the effect that she ought to be allowed to return to her home.
All the inmates of the convent had been charmed by the zeal with
which she took part in the religious exercises. When she was free
again, the scandalous doings were immediately resumed, and so it
went on all through her life.</p>

<p>After she had reduced her husband and children to despair, they
finally hoped that age would extinguish the fire with which she was
consumed. They were mistaken. The more excesses she committed,
the more she wanted to commit, the more vigorous she
appeared. It is hardly credible that such debased ideas and habits<span class="pagenum" id="Page432">[432]</span>
should leave intact such a sweet expression of countenance, a voice
so youthful, a behaviour so full of calm repose, and a glance of such
clear assurance. She became a widow. Her children, on account
of her horrible mode of life, could not any longer keep her at home,
and they sent her to a distant place, where they provided her with an
allowance. Since she was now old, she was at length compelled to
offer payment for the shameful services which she demanded; and as
the small allowance she received did not suffice for this purpose, she
worked with untiring zeal in order to be able to pay the great number
of her lovers.</p>

<p>To see the old, alert woman sitting at her work, as I myself saw her,
when aged seventy or upwards, without spectacles, always cleanly
and carefully, but not strikingly, dressed, with a simple and honourable
appearance, and an open countenance&mdash;to suspect her shameful
mode of life would never occur to anyone. Several of the wretched
men who were paid by her related how diligent she was. She assured
Tr&eacute;lat of her morality, in the hope that he would discharge her, and
so enable her to resume her mode of life. Tr&eacute;lat could not agree to
this, and he succeeded in obtaining from one of these men an accurate
account of her shameless loves.</p>

<p>This corrupt woman preserved her repose of manner, her excellent
appearance, and her honourable demeanour until her death. She
died at the age of seventy-four years from a cerebral h&aelig;morrhage.
There was no remarkable change in the brain (<i>Journ. de M&eacute;d. de Paris</i>,
1889, No. 16).</p>

<p>With regard to the treatment of abnormal sexual hyperexcitability,
the severer forms&mdash;satyriasis and nymphomania&mdash;urgently
need <b>asylum treatment</b>. In the slighter forms favourable
results will be obtained by means of psycho-therapeutics,
the internal use of sedatives (such as monobromide of camphor
and bromide of potassium), regulation of the diet, suitable
clothing and <span class="nowrap">bedding.<a id="FNanchor432"></a><a href="#Footnote432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>The converse of sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia is <b>sexual an&aelig;sthesia</b>, or
the <b>abnormal diminution of the sexual impulse</b>. It occurs in
both sexes as a <b>congenital</b> condition, owing in such cases to
atrophy or absence of the genital organs, after exhausting
diseases, or in consequence of arrest of development of the reproductive
organs from unknown causes. This latter condition
is denoted by A. Eulenburg by the name of &#8220;<b>psycho-sexual
infantilism</b>.&#8221; The same author also terms sexual an&aelig;sthesia
&#8220;sexual loss of appetite.&#8221; It is commoner in women than
in men. It is often merely <b>apparent</b>&mdash;a pseudo-an&aelig;sthesia&mdash;because<span class="pagenum" id="Page433">[433]</span>
the man does not understand how to awaken the still
slumbering sexual perceptions (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page86">p. 86</a>). Recently
Otto Adler has written a comprehensive and interesting monograph
on this &#8220;Deficient Sexual Sensibility in Women&#8221; (Berlin,
1904). According to him, the statement of Guttzeit, <b>that of
ten women, four have no sensation at all &#8220;in coitu,&#8221; and submit to
it without any agreeable sensation at all during the friction,
and without any intimation of the intense pleasure of ejaculation</b>&mdash;that
is, that 40&nbsp;% of women suffer from coldness and lack of
sensibility, from &#8220;<b>frigidity</b>&#8221;&mdash;is indeed somewhat exaggerated
in respect of the percentage; but still it is a correct expression of
the fact that deficient sexual sensibility is much commoner in
women than it is in men, in whom
<span class="nowrap">Effertz,<a id="FNanchor433"></a><a href="#Footnote433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></span> for example, estimates
the frequency of frigidity at only 1
<span class="nowrap">%.<a id="FNanchor434"></a><a href="#Footnote434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></span> In women various circumstances
explain the frequency of deficient sexual sensibility.
First of all, <b>masturbation</b> lowers sexual excitability in women
much more than it does in man, and, above all, it blunts sensibility
for normal sexual intercourse, both by means of psychical
influences and by the insensibility of the external genital organs,
owing to deficient stimulation of the clitoris during normal
intercourse, whereas this organ is most powerfully stimulated
during masturbation. Sexual frigidity also occurs in women in
consequence of maladroitness and brutality of the man <i>in coitu</i>,
giving rise rather to pain than to voluptuous sensations, and
very frequently being the cause of the first onset of the so-called
<b>vaginal spasm</b>, or
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>vaginismus</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor435"></a><a href="#Footnote435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></span>
It is also due in some cases
to impotence on the part of the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page434">[434]</span></p>

<p>In an interesting and valuable work, Carl Laker, in the year
1889, described, as &#8220;A Peculiar Form of Perversion of the Sexual
Impulse in the Female&#8221; (German <i>Archives of Gyn&aelig;cology</i>, 1889,
vol. xxxiv., No. 3, pp. 293 <i>et seq.</i>), cases of sexual frigidity in
woman <i>in coitu</i>, which are not to be regarded as cases of &#8220;an&aelig;sthesia
sexualis,&#8221; since the <b>sexual impulse</b> was normal&mdash;indeed,
frequently was increased&mdash;and it was sexual gratification in
normal intercourse which was completely wanting. In these
cases gratification was obtainable only by simple or mutual
onanism. There existed a normal inclination towards the other
sex, associated with mental and physical health. The author
assumes that, in consequence of some anatomical abnormality,
stimulation of the sensory nerves by which the voluptuous sensation
is perceived, especially those of the clitoris, failed to occur;
but perhaps by a change of posture <i>in coitu</i> this stimulation can
still be effected. The case previously reported by me on page 86
belongs to this category of <b>relative</b> or <b>temporary</b> sexual an&aelig;sthesia;
whereas in cases of genuine <b>absolute</b> sexual an&aelig;sthesia the
sexual <b>impulse</b> also is in abeyance at the outset, or disappears in
consequence of excesses and in female libertines and in prostitutes.</p>

<p>The <b>treatment</b> of deficient sexual sensibility in women must,
above all, take into consideration psychical influences, and
depends, therefore, more on the husband or lover than it does on
the physician; the conditions of intercourse must be adapted
to the particular circumstances of the case (as by change of
posture in coitus, preparatory tenderness, etc.). Painful sensibility
in vaginismus can sometimes be cured by mechanical
treatment, by the removal of painful remnants of the hymen, by
the cure of small lesions, and also by extension by means of the
speculum. It also appears, as is evidenced by an observation
of Courty, that at the time of impregnation there occurs a stronger
stimulation and voluptuous sensation <i>in coitu</i> in women who are
at other times frigid.</p>

<p>Sexually frigid women of the lower classes are apt, as Effertz
points out, to become prostitutes. During the practice of their
profession they always keep a cool head, because they are at first
and always sexually insensitive, and can devote their whole
energy and regulate all their actions towards the plunder of the
man. The following case reported by Effertz (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 51)
illustrates this connexion very clearly:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I was once consulted by a very highly placed hetaira on account
of supposed articular rheumatism. When I informed her of my
diagnosis of lues, she was greatly moved, and said to me that I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page435">[435]</span>
not therefore think the worse of her. She was better than her occupation;
she had never followed it on account of evil passions; she was
quite insensitive; she had done it only in order to provide for her
parents freedom from care in the evening of their life, and to secure the
future of her small child. She also told me on this occasion that she
owed her success to her coldness, <b>for which condition she was extremely
thankful</b>. She never gave herself for less than 1,000 marks
(&pound;50). At the same time, she made a mock of her colleagues&mdash;those
stupid and wicked girls who frequently, when their heads were fired
by champagne, would give themselves for nothing, and would even
run after men.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Otto Adler describes Madame de Warens, in Rousseau&#8217;s &#8220;Confessions,&#8221;
as a type of such a <i>femme de glace</i>. Frigid women
marry with comparatively greater frequency than women who
are sexually very excitable, because their natural reserve endows
them with greater value in the eyes of men, and also offers a
certain security for their faithfulness. Such marriages are
naturally in almost all cases unhappy, for the man soon grasps
the true nature of the case, and since most will say with Ovid,
<i>odi concubitus qui non utrimque resolvunt</i>, he seeks outside the
house some <b>response</b> for his
<span class="nowrap">love.<a id="FNanchor436"></a><a href="#Footnote436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></span> In some cases, indeed, frigid
women make a pretence of experiencing libido and the sexual
orgasm, so that the man is deceived. In some cases, also, notwithstanding
a manifest frigidity on the part of the wife, the
marriage is none the less happy when the husband is partially
or wholly impotent, and voluntarily renounces coitus. Such a
case I myself recently observed.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The case was that of a merchant, physically and bodily in excellent
health, aged a little under forty years, who, since the eleventh
year of his age down to the present time, has continued to masturbate
(between the eleventh and eighteenth years of his life, twice daily).
He has often had ejaculation <b>without</b> erection. When twenty years
of age, he frequently attempted coitus, but could not obtain an
erection. Generally speaking, he never had an erection when his
attention was directed to the matter, but only without his co-operation,
on other occasions than those of attempted sexual intercourse.
Thus, until his engagement, in the thirtieth year of his age, he had
never completed normal coitus, but had only obtained sexual gratification
by means of masturbation, and therefore married with considerable
hesitation, although during the eleven months of his engagement
he had masturbated much less frequently. On the wedding-night,
however, and later, it <b>appeared</b> that his wife had a <b>natural
disinclination to coitus</b>, was <b>extremely frigid</b>, and only had traces of
sexual sensation when, by means of onanistic stimulation on the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page436">[436]</span>
of her husband, her libido was slightly stimulated. Spontaneously
she never felt any desire for sexual gratification, not even in consequence
of masturbation. The two have lived for seven years in <b>most
happy</b> married life, and love one another tenderly, <b>without</b> ever having
completed coitus. This deficient sensibility in the wife, and her
failure to respond, have naturally not relieved the impotence of the
husband, and he gratifies himself now, as before, by solitary masturbation.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This case proves that the capacity for love is to a certain extent
independent of the strength of the libido; frigid men and women
can be thoroughly &#8220;erotic&#8221;; that is to say, they can experience
the need for tenderness, just as &#8220;erotomania&#8221;&mdash;that is to say,
the excessive longing for love&mdash;is completely different in its
nature from satyriasis and nymphomania (= excessive sexual
<span class="nowrap">desire).<a id="FNanchor437"></a><a href="#Footnote437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>Julius Pagel and other authors have recently drawn attention
to the fact that the condition of &#8220;erotomania&#8221;&mdash;excessive
amativeness&mdash;was fully described by the ancient and medieval
physicians, who regarded it as a morbid state. He published
(in the <i>Deutsche Medizinal-Zeitung</i>, 1892, p. 841) under the
title, &#8220;A Historical Contribution to the Chapter of &#8216;Cures by
Disgust,&#8217;&#8221; the translation of a passage from the <i>Lilium Medicin&aelig;</i>
of Bernhard von Gordon in Montpelier, a well-known and favourite
compendium of the beginning of the fourteenth century, in which,
following the example of Avicenna, the <i>amor (h)ereos</i> was numbered
among the <i>melancholic&aelig; passiones</i>, and was considered to
constitute a particular section of the group of diseases of the
brain (see the edition of the <i>Lilium Medicin&aelig;</i>, p. 210 (Lyons,
1550)). It is, unfortunately, impossible here to deal at any
length with the exceedingly instructive and remarkable contents.
One of the methods of treatment was to find an old hag as hideous
and repulsive as possible, who was to hold under the nose of the
erotomaniac a chemise stained with menstrual blood, saying at
the same time, <i>talis est amica tua</i>. We may remark, in passing,
that this genuine medieval &#8220;cure by disgust&#8221; diverges, much to
its disadvantage, from the manner in which in antiquity (three
centuries before Christ) Erasistratos, the pupil of Aristotle, a
celebrated physician of the Alexandrian school, cured the son of
King Antiochus, who had fallen in love with his stepmother
Stratonica. An account of the ancient therapeutic art is also
to be found in another work by J. Pagel, &#8220;Introduction to the
History of Medicine&#8221; (Berlin, 1898). In a comprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page437">[437]</span>
work, &#8220;The History of Love Considered as a Disease,&#8221; this topic
has recently been considered by Hjalmar Crohns. Here we have
a theme the literature of which is very extensive, and which might
be suitably dealt with in a special treatise.</p>

<p>In the male, sexual frigidity in the majority of cases is associated
with sexual weakness or with impotence&mdash;that is to say,
with the impossibility of copulating or of procreation. The
former variety of sexual incapacity (<i>impotentia c&#339;undi</i>) is,
properly speaking, peculiar to the male. The second form&mdash;true
&#8220;sterility&#8221; (<i>impotentia generandi</i>)&mdash;occurs in women as well as
in men.</p>

<p>In the case of male impotence, various symptoms, preliminary
disturbances, and associated phenomena, make their appearance,
and these we shall have to describe separately, since they often
occur as independent disorders.</p>

<p>This is, above all, true of the <b>outflow of sexual secretions from
the urethra</b>, <b>seminal losses</b>
<span class="nowrap">(<b>pollutions</b><a id="FNanchor438"></a><a href="#Footnote438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></span>
and <b>spermatorrh&#339;a</b>), and
the evacuation of the <b>secretion of the prostate gland</b>, the so-called
&#8220;<b>prostatorrh&#339;a</b>.&#8221; The literature of these conditions, which are
partly physiological (as a proportion of pollutions) and partly
morbid, is enormous. Of fundamental importance, notwithstanding
the serious exaggerations of the author, is the celebrated
work of Dr. M. Lallemand, &#8220;Involuntary Losses of
Semen.&#8221; In recent times this important province of sexual
pathology has been more especially advanced by the researches
of leading German physicians, above all by those of Curschmann
and F&uuml;rbringer.</p>

<p>The most important question with regard to seminal losses or
pollutions in any case is this: have we to do with physiological
processes, lying within the range of health, or have we to do with
morbid processes?</p>

<p>As normal, not morbid, seminal losses Lallemand regarded
pollutions in <b>healthy, sexually mature, continent</b> individuals,
occurring <b>spontaneously during sleep</b>, associated with <b>erection</b> of
the penis and voluptuous sensations. He rightly regarded these
as physiologically necessary, indicated their purpose to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page438">[438]</span>
discharge of sexual tension, the prevention of an excessive accumulation
of the reproductive products, and compared their effect
with that of h&aelig;morrhages from the nose, which are so common
in youth, and in most cases are distinctly beneficial. But he
drew attention to the <b>indeterminate, fluctuating boundary-line</b>
between normal and morbid pollutions. This latter point of
view is dealt with also by Eulenburg (&#8220;Sexual Neurasthenia,&#8221;
p. 171), in opposition to other authors who regarded all pollutions,
even the physiological, as abnormal. In practice, however,
it is generally not difficult to distinguish between physiological
and morbid seminal losses. The former are characterized,
not only by the distinctive signs already mentioned, but also
by their occurrence <b>at longer intervals</b>, and by the <b>absence</b> of any
disadvantageous effect upon the general state of health. As
soon as pollutions have such a deleterious influence they are
morbid; and they are generally morbid when they occur abnormally
<b>early</b>, before puberty, with abnormal <b>frequency</b>, at abnormal
<b>times of the day</b>, and in association with abnormal <b>conditions of
the genital organs</b>. According to F&uuml;rbringer, the normal intervals
between pollutions in the case of continent youths vary
between ten and thirty days. L&ouml;wenfeld considers pollutions
occurring once a week, and even the transient occurrence of pollutions
on several successive nights, as a result of sexual excitement,
as being still within normal bounds. But if these repeated
pollutions within a single week, or even within a single day, continue
<b>for a long time</b>, we are always concerned with morbid
pollutions. These sometimes occur not only at night, but
also&mdash;a fact to which the German physician Wichmann, in his
dissertation <i>De Pollutione Diurna</i> (G&ouml;ttingen, 1782), drew
attention&mdash;they occur <b>by day</b> (&#8220;diurnal pollutions&#8221;), in the
waking state, without masturbation or coitus, upon slight
mechanical or physical stimulation. In such cases erection of
the penis is often completely <b>wanting</b>; ejaculation of the semen
takes place with the organ flaccid, and even without any voluptuous
sensation. In many cases, indeed, these pollutions are
accompanied by actual <b>painful</b> sensations in the genital organs,
and instead of voluptuous dreams or thoughts, the nocturnal
ejaculation is accompanied by anxious dreams, the daylight
pollution by an extremely disagreeable sensation. Commonly
in these pollutions ordinary semen is at first evacuated&mdash;a
mixture of the secretions of the testicles, the prostate, the
vesicul&aelig; seminales, and Cowper&#8217;s glands&mdash;containing numerous
<b>spermatozoa</b>. After the trouble has lasted a long time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page439">[439]</span>
semen becomes thinner (owing to its containing a smaller proportion
of the thick testicular secretion) and more transparent;
the spermatozoa are less numerous and mostly undeveloped, and
ultimately they may be completely absent. L&ouml;wenfeld observed
a peculiar form of pollution in which the semen was ejaculated
only in drops, or might be <b>completely wanting</b>&mdash;that is to say,
there might be a pollution <b>without</b> ejaculation, purely a voluptuous
<span class="nowrap">orgasm.<a id="FNanchor439"></a><a href="#Footnote439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>In such cases L&ouml;wenfeld was able to prove that it is not the
loss of semen which weakens, as Lallemand assumed, but that
it is the <b>nervous disturbance</b> of the lumbar spinal cord which
plays the principal part. This irritable weakness of the lumbar
spinal cord may have existed for a long time before, or may have
developed only as the result of repeated pollutions or of excessive
sexual excitement; it may give rise, not only to proper seminal
emissions, but, in addition, to &#8220;<b>spermatorrh&#339;a</b>&#8221;&mdash;that is to
say, to the <b>outflow of semen accompanying urination or defecation</b>;
and it may also cause the rarer &#8220;<b>prostatorrh&#339;a</b>&#8221;&mdash;the
outflow of the secretion of the prostate gland. A long duration
of all these morbid discharges has a serious effect on the
health, and induces the typical picture of sexual neurasthenia.
As a <b>cause</b> of seminal losses we must mention masturbation,
excessive sexual intercourse, chronic inflammation of the urethra
(especially after <b>gonorrh&#339;a</b>), stricture of the urethra, rectal
affections, alcoholism, diabetes, and tabes dorsalis.</p>

<p>In <b>women</b>, also, <b>processes analogous to pollution</b> may be observed,
although much more rarely than in men, and generally
as a consequence of masturbation practised for several years.
According to Adler (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 130), pollutions&mdash;that is to say,
evacuations of the secretion of the vaginal glands and of the
uterine mucous membrane, as well as of the secretion of Bartholin&#8217;s
glands near the vaginal inlet&mdash;never occur in chaste and
intact virgins, but only in women who have already learned
the enjoyment of sexual intercourse, and who are subsequently
compelled to lead a continent life. For this reason pollutions
are a &#8220;trouble of young widows,&#8221; and occur in young girls only
when they have learned to know the nature of sexual pleasure
by means of masturbation. Eulenburg remarks (&#8220;Sexual Neurasthenia,&#8221;
p. 174):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In connexion with lascivious dreams there occur spontaneous,
more or less abundant, discharges of the clear muco-gelatinous secretion
of the glands. These form a striking manifestation of sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page440">[440]</span>
neurasthenia in women, and can be compared with the morbid pollutions
occurring in similar circumstances in male neurasthenics. We
hear less about them, however, and they are insufficiently known, even
by medical men. For this reason especially, when they occur in
association with physical virginity and a normal genital condition in
other respects, they do not usually receive sufficient attention.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The older physicians, especially those of the eighteenth
<span class="nowrap">century,<a id="FNanchor440"></a><a href="#Footnote440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span>
described these pollutions in women very well and
thoroughly; in erotic and pornographic literature they have
always played a great part. An interesting observation on
peculiar processes analogous to pollutions is reported by Paul
<span class="nowrap">Bernhardt.<a id="FNanchor441"></a><a href="#Footnote441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></span>
A hysterical sempstress, twenty-five years of age,
as the result of any kind of <b>annoyance</b>, experienced sexual excitement
completely resembling the sensation of sexual intercourse,
and ending with a discharge of mucus. This was, however,
never accompanied by any trace of voluptuous sensation; on
the contrary, it gave rise to lumbar pains. Also, when she
dreamed of anything <b>disagreeable</b> or had <b>nightmare</b>, this condition
recurred. Erotically the patient is very indifferent, and
denies the practice of masturbation.</p>

<p>To the category suggested by P. Bernhardt of sexual excitement
induced by anxiety and trouble belongs the case reported to
me by Dr. Emil Bock of a boy of fifteen years of age, who, when
very anxious about his inability to complete a school task, experienced
an ejaculation for the first time. To the literature
of impotence belongs the work by Nicolo Barrucco, &#8220;Sexual
Neurasthenia, and its Relations to the Diseases of the Genital
Organs.&#8221; Regarding physiological pollutions, and the trifling
difference between them and normal seminal discharge during
coitus, Schopenhauer makes some apt observations in his &#8220;Neue
Paralipomena,&#8221; pp. 230, 231.</p>

<p>In the <b>treatment</b> of pollutions, which always demands the most
careful medical observation and examination of the individual
case, the most important measures are <b>dietetic and hygienic<span class="pagenum" id="Page441">[441]</span>
treatment</b>, <b>change of scene</b> from town to <b>country</b>, and especially
to <b>mountain air</b>, methodical <b>hydrotherapeutic measures</b>, <b>warm
baths</b>, <b>massage</b>, <b>electricity</b>, <b>hyperalimentation</b>, the use of <b>bromides</b>,
<b>local treatment of the urethra</b>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The last and most important of the phenomena connected
with sexual neurasthenia is <b>sexual weakness</b> or <b>impotence</b> in its
various <span class="nowrap">forms.<a id="FNanchor442"></a><a href="#Footnote442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>We distinguish in the male <b>two principal forms</b> of impotence:
(1) &#8220;<b>Impotentia coeundi</b>&#8221;&mdash;that is, incapacity for erection of the
penis and the completion of coitus; (2) &#8220;<b>impotentia generandi</b>&#8221;&mdash;that
is, the impossibility of fertilization (owing to want of semen
or to the lack of fertilizing quality in this fluid).</p>

<p>Congenital malformations of the genital organs giving rise
to impotence are extremely rare. Gyurkovechky, amongst
6,000 men fit for military service, found three such men
only. More frequently are <b>acquired</b> defects met with as causes
of impotence, such as complete or partial loss of the penis
and testicles, as in eunuchs and castrated persons. It is
well known that, notwithstanding the removal of the external
genital organs, sexual desire may persist; and when the penis is
retained, though the testicles have been removed, erection and
copulation are possible, providing the castration was effected
after puberty. But it is obvious that in most cases potency is
very markedly interfered with, and ultimately it may entirely
disappear. More light is thrown on the question by the occurrence
of impotence after <b>unilateral</b> castration. A tragical case
of this latter kind is reported by von Gyurkovechky (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 71):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;A former colleague of mine at the University of Vienna had to
have one of his testicles removed in consequence of obstinate inflammation
resulting from gonorrh&#339;a; thereafter the second testicle
underwent complete atrophy. The much-to-be-pitied, handsome,
elegant, and amiable young man remained for some years capable of
performing coitus, was greatly pleased with himself for this reason,
and paid ostentatious court to ladies. Still, he was seldom in a
position to perform coitus, and after three years he completely withdrew
himself from the society of ladies, and became gradually morose<span class="pagenum" id="Page442">[442]</span>
and reserved, until one day he disappeared from Vienna, discontinued
his studies, and never let any of us hear from him again. This case
has remained very vividly in my memory, and it illustrates most
clearly the influence of virile potency upon the entire being of the
individual.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>If the second testicle remains intact, the capacity for sexual
intercourse is not interfered with; and reproductive capacity also
persists, although it may be diminished in degree.</p>

<p>An important source of sterility in the male, in which the
capacity for sexual intercourse remains unimpaired, is <b>bilateral
epididymitis</b>, consequent upon <b>gonorrh&#339;a</b>. This represents more
than 50&nbsp;% of all the cases of incapacity for procreation in the
male. Finger found in 85&nbsp;% of cases of epididymitis that the
<b>spermatozoa were absent from the semen</b> (the so-called &#8220;<b>azoospermia</b>&#8221;);
and F&uuml;rbringer is led by his own experience to
believe that 80&nbsp;% of men who have had double epididymitis are
incapable of procreation. Thus we may really speak of &#8220;<b>gonorrh&#339;al
sterility in the male</b>.&#8221; In many sterile marriages the fault
lies with the husband, as was first clearly proved by F. Kehrer&#8217;s
fundamental investigations. And the no less momentous
gonorrh&#339;al sterility in women is also, in the majority of cases,
ultimately dependent upon the husband, who has presented his
wife with &#8220;gonorrh&#339;al infection as a wedding
<span class="nowrap">gift.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor443"></a><a href="#Footnote443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>An extremely <b>small size</b> of the penis, also a <b>relatively small
size</b> of this organ in cases of obesity and tumours, <b>malformations</b>
of the penis, also the by no means rare mechanical hindrances to
erections due to injuries and indurations in the corpora cavernosa
(especially as a result of gonorrh&#339;al inflammation)&mdash;all these
may make coitus impossible. F&uuml;rbringer and Finger have also
seen peculiar chronic shrinking processes of the corpora cavernosa
occur independently of gonorrh&#339;a and tumours. All these conditions
give rise to <b>incomplete</b> erection, in which the penis is bent
at an angle at some point or other, or is curved, so that it cannot
be introduced into the vagina (chordee).</p>

<p>All the hitherto described forms of impotentia coeundi are
less frequent than those <b>in which the external genital organs are
completely intact</b>, and in which we have to do simply with <b>imperfection</b>
or <b>complete failure of erection</b> in consequence of various
<b>general disorders</b>.</p>

<p>Erection of the penis is induced both <b>centrally</b> from the
brain (by voluptuous ideas), and from the spinal cord (by direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page443">[443]</span>
stimulation), and also <b>peripherally</b> from the genital organs (by
friction of the glans penis), by stimuli proceeding from the urethra,
bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum, and the neighbourhood
of the genital organs (as, for example, the buttocks), and
may be either of a morbid or of a physiological character. When
there are inflammatory conditions of the genital organs, especially
gonorrh&#339;a of the anterior and posterior urethra, erections occur
very readily. From the full bladder there also proceed stimuli
giving rise to erection, thus inducing the well-known &#8220;<b>morning
erection</b>,&#8221; utilized by many who would otherwise be completely
impotent. Blows on the buttocks also give rise to erections&mdash;a
subject to which we shall return when we come to discuss
flagellation.</p>

<p>The <b>nature</b> of erection can be very briefly described as consisting
in a stiffening of the penis by the profuse <b>streaming of
blood</b> into the <b>reticular spaces</b> of the <b>corpora cavernosa</b>, enlarged
by <b>stimulation</b> of the <b>erection nerves</b>. The consequent erection
of the penis is dependent upon the action of a particular muscle&mdash;the
ischio-cavernosus muscle.</p>

<p>Impotence when the external organs are intact is in most cases
due to central causes, and ultimately to psychical causes, even
though severe bodily affections or local morbid states play a predisposing
part (the so-called &#8220;<b>functional impotence</b>&#8221;).</p>

<p>This impotence is sometimes one of the <b>earliest</b> symptoms of
<b>diabetes mellitus</b> and of <b>chronic Bright&#8217;s disease with contracted
kidney</b>, also of <b>severe conditions of exhaustion</b>&mdash;to which consumption
offers a significant exception, signalized already by
the old saying, <i>phthisicus salax</i>&mdash;of <b>obesity</b>, and of <b>tabes dorsalis</b>,
in which the sexual potency gradually disappears, but libido
outlasts the capacity for erection. Certain <b>poisons</b> also particularly
damage potency. This is especially the case with
<b>alcohol</b>, the deleterious influence of which on potency has already
been described (<a href="#Page293">pp. 293</a>, <a href="#Page294">294</a>). Georg Hirth goes so far as to
recognize a special &#8220;<b>impotentia alcoholica</b>.&#8221;</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Above all, no alcohol,&#8221; says he, &#8220;especially not as a means for
producing erection. In youth a man needs no such stimulus, and in
age he will be apt to find, with the porter in Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8216;Macbeth&#8217;
(Act ii., Scene 3), that &#8216;drink may be said to be an equivocator with
lechery,&#8217; for, as he says, &#8216;it provokes the desire, but it takes away the
performance; it makes lechery, and it mars him; it sets him on and
takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens him; makes him stand
to and not stand to: in conclusion, equivocates him into sleep, and,
giving him the lie, leaves
<span class="nowrap">him.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor444"></a><a href="#Footnote444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page444">[444]</span></p>

<p>F&uuml;rbringer&#8217;s view, that alcohol, taken up to the degree of slight
intoxication, rather increases potency, in connexion with which
he refers to sexual invalids who are only able to perform sexual
intercourse in a state of moderate intoxication, cannot be regarded
as generally true. It is possible that in these admitted
sexual invalids alcoholic intoxication overcomes <b>stronger psychical
inhibitions</b>, which in the state of sobriety had hindered
erection. For the normal individual alcohol is not a means for
the increase of sexual potency, but the reverse.</p>

<p><b>The free use of tobacco</b> certainly also impairs sexual
<span class="nowrap">potency.<a id="FNanchor445"></a><a href="#Footnote445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></span>
Nicotine and love are as little compatible as alcohol and love.
F&uuml;rbringer, Hirth, and Eulenburg, ascribe to the excessive use of
tobacco a diminution in sexual potency. The following interesting
passage is from the Diary of the De Goncourts (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 89):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;<b>There is an antagonism between tobacco and women. The taste
for one diminishes the taste for the other</b>. So true is this, that passionate
Lotharios usually give up smoking, <b>because they feel or believe
that tobacco diminishes their sexual appetite and their powers of love</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><b>Coffee</b> and <b>tea</b>, taken in excess, and, above all, <b>morphine</b>, are
also antagonistic to potency. Dupuy has observed the frequent
occurrence of impotence in men who were in the habit of drinking
large quantities of strong coffee (five or six breakfast-cups every
day). Sexual potency returned as soon as the use of coffee was
discontinued; whilst when the use of the beverage was resumed
the impotence again appeared (<i>Comptes Rendus de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de
Biologie</i>, 1886, No. 27).</p>

<p>The majority of cases of functional disturbances of potency
depend upon nervous impotence. It is the form which at the
present day the physician most frequently encounters. It is
intimately connected with the state of &#8220;irritable nervous weakness,&#8221;
or sexual neurasthenia, the most important symptom of
which is represented by &#8220;psychical&#8221; impotence. There exist,
also&mdash;and this justifies the independent consideration of psychical
impotence&mdash;numerous cases of impotence <b>without</b> neurasthenia
(F&uuml;rbringer). This remarkable form occurs especially in perfectly
<b>healthy</b> young <b>husbands</b>, who often before were completely
potent, and had previously effected coitus in a perfectly normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page445">[445]</span>
manner, or had lived a quiet, continent life, without having injured
themselves in any way by masturbation. Such individuals,
in consequence of the excitement, shame, and embarrassment of
the wedding-night, often suffer from psychical impotence.
<span class="nowrap">R&eacute;ti<a id="FNanchor446"></a><a href="#Footnote446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></span>
speaks of &#8220;<b>impotence due to compassion</b>,&#8221; arising from
&#8220;the sympathy felt with the pains suffered by the still virgin
wife&#8221; when the attempt at coitus is made.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The young married pair kiss one another and vie with one another
in tenderness, but when the matter becomes serious&mdash;when the husband
wants to enjoy his rights as a husband&mdash;the wife experiences
incredible anxiety; she trembles in all her limbs, writhes, screams, and
weeps. The man becomes exhausted, and at length, when the wife is
resigned, and willing to surrender herself to her fate, he has become
unfitted for his share in intercourse.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is clear that these forms of psychical impotence, which
appear in very various shades, are mostly transient phenomena,
and exhibit a good prospect of complete cure.</p>

<p>Much more difficult is the matter when we have to do with
cases, becoming commoner every day, of psychical impotence in
consequence of <b>sexual perversions</b>. Sadistic, masochistic, fetichistic,
and homosexual inclinations may, in certain individuals,
predominate to such an extent that either copulation cannot
be effected without the <b>preliminary</b> gratification of these perverse
instincts, or else the latter <b>entirely usurp the place</b> of normal
coitus, which has become, generally speaking, quite impossible
(relative and absolute psychical impotence in consequence of
sexual perversions). To the former category belong, for example,
those cases, which are by no means rarely seen, in which homosexual
persons are only able to have intercourse with their wives
after preliminary caresses by their male friends; or masochists
must be subjected to a preparatory flagellation in order to become
potent. In the second category copulation has become quite
impossible; the orgasm takes place only in connexion with the
activity of the perverse impulse, and there often exists an actual
repugnance to normal coitus.</p>

<p>Well known also is that rare relative psychical impotence in
which the man can perform coitus only with <b>prostitutes</b>, whereas
he is impotent as regards decent women. This, however, may
often be associated with the existence of sexual perversions, which
are gratified only during intercourse with prostitutes.</p>

<p>Another form of relative psychical impotence is <b>temporary</b>
impotence, in which the potency is entirely subject to <b>custom</b>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page446">[446]</span>
and a change in the custom induces impotence. Thus, Frenzel
reports the case of a man who had always had intercourse with
his wife immediately on going to bed, and proved completely
impotent when this habit was interrupted, and he now wished to
perform the act early in the morning. Only gradually did he
recover his lost potency and become able to adapt himself to the
changed <span class="nowrap">conditions.<a id="FNanchor447"></a><a href="#Footnote447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>Another form of impotence by no means rare, and occurring
in otherwise healthy men, is that produced by powerful <b>mental</b>
activity or <b>artistic</b> production, the impotence of literary men
and of artists. It is usually of a transient
<span class="nowrap">nature,<a id="FNanchor448"></a><a href="#Footnote448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></span> manifesting
itself only during the periods of intellectual activity, and it is
explicable in accordance with the law of sexual equivalents,
according to which the sexual potency appears in the latent form
of spiritual productive activity. A remarkable case of this impotence
of literary men is reported by the just quoted
<span class="nowrap">Frenzel.<a id="FNanchor449"></a><a href="#Footnote449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></span>
Allied with this variety of impotence is the form due to transient
<b>mental distraction</b>, to <b>instantaneous ideas</b>, which suddenly act
as psychical inhibitions. These sudden ideas can be of a very
varied content&mdash;joyful, sad, anxious, annoying; in every case
they are capable of annulling the <b>already existing potency</b>, and
of making the further erection of the penis impossible. Such
conditions occur alike in healthy persons and in those who are
readily excitable and neurasthenic. A classical instance of this
nature is J. J. Rousseau&#8217;s adventure with the Venetian courtesan
Giulietta, which he describes very vividly in his &#8220;Confession.&#8221;
He went to see her full of passionate desire for sexual enjoyment,
but Nature &#8220;had put into his head a poison against this unspeakable
happiness&#8221; for which his heart yearned. Hardly had
he glanced at the beautiful girl than an idea came to him which
moved him to tears, and completely diverted him from his purpose.
He became more deeply absorbed in this idea, the sexual
desires completely disappeared, and he was no longer in a position
to prove his manhood. To this tragi-comic episode we owe the
exclamation of the disappointed girl, which has passed into a
proverb: &#8220;Lascia le donne e studia la matematica&#8221; (&#8220;Leave
women alone, and go and study mathematics&#8221;). In the <b>reflective
love</b> of Kierkegaard, Grillparzer, Alfred de Musset, and
other men of remarkable genius, there is also recognizable an
element of impotence.</p>

<p>The majority of all cases of impotence belong to the class of
true <b>nervous, neurasthenic</b> impotence, and these are diffused
especially among the circles who supply the greatest contingent
to the ranks of neurasthenics in general&mdash;that is, among officers,
merchants, physicians, and other classes of the cultured part of
our population whose professional duties are arduous. Among
the causes of neurasthenic impotence, excessive masturbation
and chronic gonorrh&#339;a, with its consequences, play the principal
part. Neurasthenic impotence manifests itself, above all, by
abnormal conditions of erection and ejaculation, either of which
may by itself be diminished or completely prevented; or, again,
both may exhibit abnormalities, whilst in some cases even
erection may be <b>very frequent</b>, <b>unusually powerful</b>, and <b>long-lasting</b>
(the so-called &#8220;<b>priapism</b>&#8221;), whilst ejaculation and
voluptuous sensation are completely wanting, and these erections
are in most cases accompanied by very <b>painful</b> sensations. An
extremely characteristic symptom of nervous impotence is a
<b>premature discharge of the semen</b>, not merely <i>ante portas</i>, but often
even at the first signs of activity of the libido sexualis, at which
time erection may be very well developed. In other cases,
again, erection occurs, but no ejaculation of the semen. Finally,
both may be completely wanting (the so-called &#8220;<b>paralytic
impotence</b>&#8221;).</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">The following cases, which came under my own observation,
show some of the above-mentioned types of impotence:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. A man, twenty-nine years of age, married for ten months, complains,
after obviously excessively frequent enjoyment of his conjugal rights, of
a sense of weakness and weariness after intercourse, such as he has
never previously experienced, as well as of a continually earlier ejaculation,
latterly even on simple contact of his penis with the vulva.
Erection is always present and is powerful. On further inquiry he
admitted that in his four-weeks&#8217; honeymoon he had connexion once
daily, and thenceforward two or three times a week.</p>

<p>2. A man, twenty-one years of age, states that a year and a half
ago for the first time he endeavoured to have sexual intercourse;
he has never yet succeeded in completing coitus. Since the age of
fourteen years he has suffered from frequent pollutions and from
marked sexual excitability. He has often tried to effect coitus, but
there has always resulted precipitate ejaculation, with his penis in a
flaccid condition. He has, properly speaking, only morning erections,
dependent upon a full bladder. It is possible that a marked varicocele
on the left side has something to do with the genesis of this impotence.</p>

<p>3. A man, forty-eight years of age, has noticed for some years a
distinct decline in sexual potency. Ejaculation always occurs shortly
before <i>immissio membri</i>, when the penis is flaccid or only semi-erect. If
erection is complete, on the other hand, then ejaculation fails to occur.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page448">[448]</span></p>

<p>Very peculiar, and offering a kind of analogy to vaginismus in
women, is impotence consequent upon <b>excessively painful sensibility
of the glans penis</b>, as a result of sexual neurasthenia or of
local inflammatory processes (balanitis, etc.). The pains during
coitus in these cases are often so severe that those thus affected
completely abandon any attempt at intercourse.</p>

<p>The question <b>whether impotence can result from sexual abstinence</b>
is still disputed. F&uuml;rbringer does not know of any certain
cases. According to <span class="nowrap">Virey,<a id="FNanchor450"></a><a href="#Footnote450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></span>
by &#8220;complete and continuous
abstinence from intercourse&#8221; in the male the organs by which
the semen is prepared&mdash;the testicles, the seminal vesicles, and the
vasa deferentia&mdash;and also the penis, become smaller, &#8220;unsightly,
wrinkled, and inactive.&#8221; Galen reports the same of the
athletes of the Roman Empire, men who had to live a life of strict
continence. Virey alludes to an &#8220;extremely chaste saint, in
whom after death no trace of genital organs could be discovered&#8221; (!).
That absolute abstinence must ultimately limit
potency, if only by psychical means, is <i>a priori</i> probable.</p>

<p>Recent observations confirm the view that long-continued
absolute sexual abstinence exercises a harmful influence upon
potency, and especially upon potentia coeundi. As a proof of
this, I may more especially mention two cases of University professors,
not yet thirty years of age, both of whom until a little
while ago had had no experience of sexual intercourse, one having
remained continent during two years of married life! Quite
recently both of them repeatedly attempted normal coitus, but
with complete failure <i>quoad erectionem</i>. Von
<span class="nowrap">Schrenck-Notzing<a id="FNanchor451"></a><a href="#Footnote451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></span>
also reported a case of this character not long ago, in which,
notwithstanding the strong desire for normal sexual intercourse,
in the case of a literary man thirty-five years of age, who prior
to marriage had lived a life of <b>complete abstinence</b>, and had never
practised masturbation, every attempt at coitus proved a failure.</p>

<p>Finally, we have to consider the more or less physiological
<b>presenile and senile impotence</b> which accompanies the commencement
of old age, but naturally occurs at very different
times in different individuals, for some men are already old at
the age of forty years, and others are not yet old at the age of
seventy years. Von Gyurkovechky dates the first decline in
the sexual powers from the fortieth year of life, and considers
that normally these powers are completely extinguished at about<span class="pagenum" id="Page449">[449]</span>
sixty-five years. But there are numerous exceptions. Complete
potency in respect of libido, erection, and ejaculation has
been observed in men of seventy and eighty years; and isolated
cases have even been recorded in which men of ninety and one
hundred years have procreated
<span class="nowrap">children.<a id="FNanchor452"></a><a href="#Footnote452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span> In the sense of
Metchnikoff and Hirth, who in their writings proclaim the prevention
of senility as a hygienic ideal, this physiological <i>potentia
senilis</i> is no Utopia, and a future scientific macrobiotic will defer
the onset of old age by from ten to twenty years.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I do not ask,&#8221; says Georg Hirth, &#8220;that the man in advanced age
should play with his sexual powers; but that he should possess <b>the
consciousness of being able to use them</b>&mdash;that I do demand&#8221; (&#8220;Ways
to Love,&#8221; p. 462).</p>

<p>The treatment of impotence in the male in its various forms is
indeed a difficult matter in individual cases, more especially in
view of the great number of existing methods of treatment; but
treatment promises good results when it is based upon an exact,
critical, individual analysis of the separate causes and symptoms.
It is partly <b>local</b> and partly <b>general</b>. In the case of impotence
resulting from excessive masturbation, or in the case of the well-known
&#8220;gonorrh&#339;al&#8221; impotence, good results will be obtained
from <b>slight cauterization of the urethra</b> and <b>massage of the
prostate</b>, <b>local carbonic-acid douches</b> or carbonic-acid baths,
<b>warm or cold sitz-baths, or electrical treatment</b>, with which,
however, great care must be exercised. In some cases imperfect
erection will be benefited by the application of a 10&nbsp;% <b>ethereal
solution of camphor</b>, in the form of friction or a spray, to the
entire genital region. Mechanical apparatus have also been
employed to favour erection, as, for example, the so-called
&#8220;<b>schlitten</b>,&#8221; consisting of a conducting instrument for an insufficiently
erect penis, made up of two thin, suitably shaped
lamin&aelig; of metal, or the &#8220;<b>erector</b>&#8221; of Gassen, which works in a
similar manner. Apparatus of this nature are useful only to
this extent, that they give the penis a certain purchase. We
cannot allow that they possess any other effect, any more than
Gassen&#8217;s other apparatus, the &#8220;compressor,&#8221; the &#8220;cumulator,&#8221;
and the &#8220;ultimo&#8221; (L&ouml;wenfeld, F&uuml;rbringer). Any local changes
that can be detected as having some connexion with the occurrence
of impotence must receive attention. This is obvious; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page450">[450]</span>
no less obvious is the treatment of any general disorders which
may give rise to the impotence. As regards the general treatment
of impotence, <b>psychical</b> influence must first be considered.
<b>In most cases</b> this must take the form of temporary withdrawal
of the thoughts from the sexual sphere in general, for which the
strict prohibition of sexual activity (masturbation, etc.) forms
the foundation; in addition, <b>will</b> and <b>self-confidence</b> must be
strengthened. In these matters an intelligent wife can do much
to supplement the work of the physician. Sometimes a mere
<b>change</b> in the mode of life or in the relations between husband
and wife, above all, a change in the mode of performing sexual
intercourse (a change in posture, greater responsiveness on the
part of the wife, etc.), may have a manifest curative influence.
The treatment of the neurasthenia which may have caused the
impotence will also have a favourable effect. Alcohol and
tobacco are best entirely forbidden. Innumerable <b>drugs</b> have
been recommended for the treatment of impotence. The belief
in the beneficial effect of cantharides is as much a superstition as
the belief in the aphrodisiac action of celery, asparagus, caviare,
and truffles. Certainly all these may cause excitement of the
genital organs, but this is merely due to an increased flow of blood
to these organs, which is of a very fugitive nature, and when the
effect is often repeated (especially when cantharides is used for
this purpose), it may have serious consequences. The influence
of these substances may be compared with the purely stimulating
effect of flagellation. More confidence may be placed in <b>phosphorus</b>,
<b>strychnine</b>, and, above all, in <b>yohimbin</b>, a drug prepared
from the bark of a West African
<span class="nowrap">tree,<a id="FNanchor453"></a><a href="#Footnote453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></span> which is warmly recommended
in cases of neurasthenic impotence by Mendel and
Eulenburg. Having myself seen good results from the use of
Yohimbin Riedel in two cases of pre-senile gonorrh&#339;al impotence,
I can confirm the favourable judgment of Eulenburg. In the
case of pre-senile impotence in a man nearly sixty years of age
yohimbin was the only means which, after several years&#8217; intermission,
enabled him once more to have erections, and repeatedly
to perform coitus. Eulenburg reports the case of a man, which
is probably unique, in whom, <b>after a few days&#8217; use</b>, yohimbin
restored sexual potency after he had been impotent for twelve
years! This interesting drug is certainly a valuable enrichment
of our aphrodisiac armamentarium, and the first drug of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page451">[451]</span>
nature to which the name of a specific against impotence can
justly be given.</p>

<p>Quite recently Eulenburg, Posner, Nevinny, and others, have
warmly recommended as a true specific in cases of functional impotence
a combination of lecithin with the active principle of
the Brazilian plant <i>Muira Puama</i>. This new drug is by Eulenburg
termed &#8220;muiracithin.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the above-described individual troubles (masturbation,
sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia, sexual an&aelig;sthesia, pollutions, and impotence)
is composed the clinical picture of <b>sexual neurasthenia</b>,
which, however, is manifested also by other symptoms, among
which we must mention certain <b>perceptions of anxiety</b> and certain
<b>coercive ideas</b>, such as the condition, known also to the laity, of
<b>agoraphobia</b>, which is very frequently met with in sexual neurasthenia;
also the fear of travelling alone by railway, or sudden
anxiety in the theatre or concert-hall, in the form of the fear of
fire, with the accompanying irresistible impulse to rush out into
the open; further, <b>lumbar pains</b> and <b>neuralgia of the genital
organs</b>, and <b>anomalies</b> and <b>pains connected with the evacuation
of urine</b>; <b>an inclination to sexual perversions</b>; <b>gastric</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>affections</b>,<a id="FNanchor454"></a><a href="#Footnote454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></span>
such as nervous retching and vomiting, painful cramps of the
stomach, loss of appetite, also excessive hunger, nervous dyspepsia,
etc.; <b>migraine</b> and <b>heart troubles</b> of manifold kinds. It
is not to be wondered at that when sexual neurasthenia is
markedly developed, and when several of the above-described
manifestations occur, the disease may pass on into a condition
of complete <b>mental exhaustion</b>, associated with <b>morbid irritability</b>
and <b>hypochondriacal</b> and <b>melancholy</b> ideas. We then
ultimately see the development of typical <b>sexual hypochondria</b>.</p>

<p>The treatment of sexual neurasthenia&mdash;which in the last-described
general symptom-complex occurs also in women,
associated in their case with <b>amenorrh&#339;a</b>, <b>dysmenorrh&#339;a</b>, or
<span class="nowrap"><b>menorrhagia</b><a id="FNanchor455"></a><a href="#Footnote455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></span>&mdash;consists
for the most part in the already described
treatment of the individual symptoms. In addition, we
have to make use of hyperalimentation, <b>hydro-therapeutic methods</b>,
<b>gymnastic</b> treatment, general <b>massage</b>, and <b>climatic</b> cures.</p>

&#8220;During my life I have had under observation many a lecherous man and
many a wanton woman, and I have always found that, without exception, voluptuous
persons clothe themselves very warmly, and sleep under very warm bed-clothes.
In earlier years I have reported several cases observed by me of warm
clothing of the genital organs on the part of women who distinguished themselves
by lasciviousness, and I could increase the number of examples of this kind
by several dozen&#8221; (E. Reich, &#8220;Immorality and Intemperance,&#8221; pp. 43, 44).</p>

By vaginismus we understand involuntary convulsive contraction of the
vaginal muscles, associated with abnormal sensibility of the vaginal inlet, dependent
on masturbation, or induced by the above-mentioned painful sensations
and injuries which occur in maladroit and brutal coitus (this is by far the commonest
cause of vaginismus), especially when the penis is very large and the
vaginal inlet very small, or when the female genital organs are further forward
than usual. Vaginismus generally arises from small injuries and lacerations,
produced in this manner; with the physical sense of pain is associated also
psychical anxiety with regard to renewed attempts at intercourse; and in this
way the reflex spasm is produced. Sometimes the vaginal spasm does not
begin until after the penis has been introduced, so that this organ is retained
(<i>penis captivus</i>). A few years ago a remarkable case of this kind occurred in
Bremen. One of the dock labourers was having sexual intercourse in an out-of-the-way
corner of the docks, when the woman became affected with this involuntary
spasm, and the man was unable to free himself from his imprisonment.

<span class="smcap">Pollutions.</span>&mdash;This term has not perhaps as yet acquired a right of residence
in the English tongue, but I use it because it is needed. There is no other word
which can be employed as a general term (1) to include all involuntary emissions
of semen, whether nocturnal or diurnal; and (2) to include involuntary sexual
orgasm in the female as well as in the male. In the female the term &#8220;seminal
emission&#8221; is inapplicable; but the term &#8220;pollution&#8221; can be applied in English (as
it is in German) to either sex. By American writers the term &#8220;pollution&#8221; is
now generally used (see, for instance, Allen, &#8220;Disorders of the Male Sexual

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p class="noindent">In my &#8220;Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221;
published in the years 1902 and 1903, I for the first time attempted
to deal systematically, from the standpoint of the <b>anthropologist</b>
and <b>ethnologist</b>, with the great province of the so-called &#8220;psychopathia
sexualis,&#8221; the field of sexual aberrations, degenerations,
anomalies, perversities, and perversions. I started from the
point of view that, in order to obtain new ideas regarding the
nature of psychopathia sexualis, and in order to revise the old
ideas in the light of recent knowledge, we must keep before our
eyes, not one-sidedly &#8220;<b>the sick man</b>,&#8221; but comprehensively
&#8220;<b>man as man</b>,&#8221; both as <b>civilized man</b> and as <b>savage man</b>.</p>

<p>Previously the doctrine of psychopathia sexualis had been
dominated exclusively by <b>clinical, purely medical conceptions</b>.
Observations had been limited to morbid phenomena, occurring
in individuals with an abnormal <i>vita sexualis</i>. Thus there had
arisen a general view of the <b>nature</b> of sexual anomalies, by which
these anomalies were allotted almost entirely to the province of
the physician, and were described as <b>stigmata of degeneration</b>.
H. J. <span class="nowrap">L&ouml;wenstein,<a id="FNanchor456"></a><a href="#Footnote456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></span>
H&auml;ussler,<a id="FNanchor457"></a><a href="#Footnote457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and
<span class="nowrap">Kaan,<a id="FNanchor458"></a><a href="#Footnote458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></span> in the third and fifth
decades of the nineteenth century, were the first to adopt this
medical point of view of sexual aberrations; and finally, in the
last quarter of the same century, Richard von
<span class="nowrap">Krafft-Ebing<a id="FNanchor459"></a><a href="#Footnote459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></span>
converted modern sexual pathology into a comprehensive
scientific <span class="nowrap">system,<a id="FNanchor460"></a><a href="#Footnote460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></span>
which stands and falls with the idea of <b>degeneration</b>.</p>

<p>Von Krafft-Ebing is, and remains, the true founder of modern
sexual pathology. Without wishing in the slightest degree to
underestimate the value of the clinical researches he carried out
in this province of research, characterized by precision and profound
scientific zeal&mdash;without undervaluing for a moment these
extraordinary services&mdash;I am compelled to point out that his
purely medical view of sexual aberrations is one-sided, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page456">[456]</span>
insist that it must be amplified and rectified by anthropological
and ethnological researches.</p>

<p>Let us leave the hospital and the medical consulting-room; let
us make a journey round the world; let us observe the sexual
activity of the <i>genus homo</i> in its manifold phenomena, not as
physicians, but as ordinary observers; let us compare the sexuality
of the civilized human being with that of the savage: then
we shall recognize the vast extension of our visual field for the
comprehension of psychopathia sexualis; we shall see how the
civilized and temporary phenomenon becomes absorbed into
the general human phenomenon, presenting amid all local variations
<b>the same fundamental lineaments</b>. Psychopathia sexualis
exists <b>everywhere</b> and <b>at all times</b>. Culture, civilization, and
diseases play only the parts of favouring, modifying, intensifying
factors.</p>

<p>I do not go so far as Freud, who, on account of the now generally
recognized wide diffusion of perverse sexual tendencies, is compelled
to adopt the view &#8220;that the rudiments of perversions are
the <b>primeval</b> general rudiments of the human sexual impulse, out
of which the normal sexual mode of behaviour is developed in
the course of evolution, in consequence of organic changes and
psychical <span class="nowrap">inhibitions&#8221;;<a id="FNanchor461"></a><a href="#Footnote461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></span>
but I do maintain that sexual perversities
and perversions appertain to the human race as such, and
independently of civilization. I am convinced that they are
<b>supplementary</b> to normal sexual manifestations, and that their
diffusion among civilized and savage peoples <b>extends far more
widely than the circle of true degenerative phenomena</b>.</p>

<p>The sexual impulse, as a purely physical function, is neither
an object of comparison nor a distinctive characteristic between
primitive and civilized humanity. The &#8220;elementary ideas&#8221; of
humanity return everywhere again in the elementary manifestations
of sexual aberrations.</p>

<p>From the investigations collected and published in the above-mentioned
work I have been led to the firm conviction, which I
must now put forward as a <b>scientific truth</b> based upon the teaching
of anthropology, folk-lore, and the history of civilization, that
at the present day, in our time so widely decried as &#8220;nervous,&#8221;
&#8220;degenerate,&#8221; and &#8220;overcivilized,&#8221; not only are there no more
sexually &#8220;perverse&#8221; persons than there were in former days&mdash;let
us think only of the middle ages, with their frightful excesses,
appearing in epidemic diffusion&mdash;but, further, that the greater
part of the perversions of the present day are not to be regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page457">[457]</span>
as &#8220;degenerations&#8221; at all; and, finally, that the factors which
are to weaken and undermine the vital forces of a nation must
be something other than purely sexual factors. For sexual
aberrations alone have, taken as a whole, but a trifling influence
in effecting the decadence of a nation. They first gain such an
influence in combination with causes, which we cannot now discuss,
of an economic and political nature.</p>

<p>As old as humanity is the fable of the good old times, of the
golden youth of the human race, of the glorious past, to which an
always corrupt, physically and morally rotten <b>present</b> is supposed
to have <span class="nowrap">succeeded.<a id="FNanchor462"></a><a href="#Footnote462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></span>
The ancients held this view; it recurred at
the time of the renascence; and since the time of Rousseau&#8217;s
unfortunate condemnation of all civilization, it has been, in the
hands of all zealots, moral fanatics, backsliders, and guardians
of conventional morality, a greatly prized weapon, and one, also,
of great power when used to influence the ignorant and easily
misled. Anthropology, the history of primitive man, and the
history of civilization in general, have utterly destroyed this
beautiful dream of the good old times and of the <b>better</b> days of
the past. Nothing has been left but the ever <b>more beautiful</b>
present!</p>

<p>The critical and far-sighted Lessing opposed Rousseau&#8217;s
hypothesis of corruption by means of &#8220;civilization.&#8221; It was
true, he said, that Athens, standing so high in civilization, and
at the same time so corrupt, passed away; but the <b>virtuous</b> Sparta,
did not this also pass away? Rousseau himself had to admit
that the destruction of civilization would be of no use, that the
world would then relapse into barbarism, and that the corruption
would <b>none the less</b> persist. The philologist
<span class="nowrap">Muff,<a id="FNanchor463"></a><a href="#Footnote463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></span> discussing
this question, added that if civilization had not come, vice
would still have been dominant, and that civilization, involving
as it does <b>intellectual</b> progress, provides also the means for
counteracting vice.</p>

<p>Physicians and natural philosophers have long protested
against the theory of the corrupt and degenerate &#8220;present.&#8221;
For instance, a countryman of Rousseau&#8217;s, Dr.
<span class="nowrap">Delvincourt,<a id="FNanchor464"></a><a href="#Footnote464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></span>
exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page458">[458]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;How false is the assumption of the fanatics and the pious who
attribute to the moral corruption of our century the majority of
diseases, and, above all, venereal diseases; who maintain that the
race is degenerating; and who thunder an anathema against modern
young men, whom they would gladly muzzle as we muzzle an animal.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Must we, then, he asks, at a moment when civilization is
marching forward with giant strides, have our ears wearied
with sophisms which can no longer deceive even the ignorant
masses? And he shows how <b>since primeval times, everywhere</b>,
all over the earth, vice has been diffused. He rightly points to
the innumerable <i>monuments de turpitude</i> of all ages.</p>

<p>About the same time (be it noted, more than sixty years ago)
in Germany the celebrated natural philosopher Christian Gottfried
Ehrenberg, in an academic speech with the distinctive title &#8220;<b>The
Fear that Progressive Intellectual Development will Lead to
Physical National Degeneration: A Demonstration that this
Fear is entirely devoid of Scientific and Medical Foundation</b>&#8221;
(Berlin, 1842), opposed the belief in the unwholesome influence
of civilization upon the popular strength and popular morals.
Of special interest to us are his remarks upon the alleged deleterious
influence of civilization upon sexuality. He says
(p. 8):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The occurrence of puberty in warm climates at a comparatively
early age (from ten to fifteen years), in cold climates somewhat later
(from fourteen to eighteen years), is a natural measure of human intelligence
and power; and if our sexually mature youths at school, at
the time at which their development has naturally progressed to this
point, experience also sexual stimulation, this is entirely according to
the nature of things, and only imposes upon those in charge of schools,
and upon parents, the special duty of watchfulness in these respects.
Even if secret vice becomes general anywhere among young fellows in
a manner open to regret, still, this does not mean that our schools
are the cause of physical weakness, of overstimulation, and of deterioration
of the people and of the epoch; it merely indicates a local
deficiency in energetic purposive education, and a lack of the necessary
watchfulness over the youths in the particular institution in which the
trouble has occurred, or that the family life of the children thus affected
is less strictly moral than we could wish; and the evil is only to be
overcome by counteracting its especial causes. In many cases we may
compare outbreaks of premature sexuality with epidemics of disease,
which also find entrance through lack of sufficient care. Just the same
is it in respect of the great mass of adults who, by exhortation and
example on the part of those whose business it is to give them counsel,
are in most cases so easily led in the right direction, but who, in the
absence of such judicious treatment, often give way to the most unbridled
licentiousness. The student of popular history will easily
find numerous instances of cause and effect, now of the former and now
of the latter kind.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page459">[459]</span></p>

<p>Ehrenberg comes to the conclusion, most encouraging to ourselves
and to our time, and one which may be unhesitatingly
accepted, that the entire history of humanity, in so far as that
history is open to us, leads us to believe, not that the progress of
<span class="nowrap">civilization<a id="FNanchor465"></a><a href="#Footnote465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></span>
has given rise to infirmity or to nervous overstimulation
of the people, but, on the contrary, that as the
centuries pass, <b>our bodies are as powerfully developed as formerly</b>,
and that there is an ever-happier development of all the nobler
human activities, such as can only result from an improvement
in our mental faculties.</p>

<p>At the fifty-ninth Congress of German Natural Philosophers and
Physicians, held at Berlin in the year 1886, the celebrated physicist
Werner von Siemens, discussing the same problem in a formal
speech, proved the nullity of the hypothesis of the evil influence
of civilization upon the physical and moral nature of humanity,
and expressed himself as fully convinced that</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;our activity in research and discovery conducts humanity to higher
stages of civilization, ennobles humanity, and makes ideal aims more
easily accessible; that the coming scientific age will diminish poverty
and illness, will increase the enjoyment of life, and will make humanity
better, happier, and more contented with its lot.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>&#8220;Has humanity degenerated?&#8221; asks a celebrated
<span class="nowrap">specialist,<a id="FNanchor466"></a><a href="#Footnote466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></span>
who, owing to the nature of his speciality, has been able to obtain
exhaustive information regarding what is often believed to be a
symptom of degeneration&mdash;namely, falling out of the hair and
baldness&mdash;and he answers:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;<b>Certainly not!</b> In the process of civilization, which has lasted
for many thousands of years, our organization has not experienced
any serious convulsion of its fundamental nature. Superficially
only have the battles we have had to fight made any mark upon us.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>To a frightful extent in earlier times the great infective epidemic
diseases decimated civilized humanity, to an extent which is hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page460">[460]</span>
realized at the present day, and those of more powerful constitution
were undoubtedly carried off quite as much as those
endowed with weaker powers of resistance. Bubonic plague,
small-pox, leprosy, the sweating sickness, scarlatina, cholera, and
syphilis (which at its commencement was a far more severe
disease than it is at the present day), have often annihilated the
blossoms of youth; and yet mankind as a whole has not suffered
therefrom. Formerly there were much more violent and obstinate
nervous troubles than our modern &#8220;nervousness,&#8221; which, to a
large extent, represents merely a <b>phenomenon of adaptation</b>, not
a disease in the proper sense of the term. St. Vitus&#8217;s dance, the
dancing mania, and similar psycho-nervous epidemics, disturbed
medieval humanity, without, however, giving rise to any permanent
injury, and without causing progressive degeneration.
And the most frightful sexual excesses can do no harm to the
strength of the nation.</p>

<p>With regard to this point, the reputed connexion between sexual
excesses and the political downfall of a nation, Carl
<span class="nowrap">Bleibtreu<a id="FNanchor467"></a><a href="#Footnote467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></span>
rightly remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Ancient Rome produced its greatest men during a period of moral
degeneration. The finest blossoms of Hellenic civilization coincided
with a period of fundamental immorality. We might easily urge that
after Pericles, Phidias, Aristophanes, Euripides, Alcibiades, and
Socrates, the decay of the Greek race began, notwithstanding the fact
that much later in Greek history the vital force of the nation was
proved by the appearance of men of the first rank, such as Alexander,
Aristotle, and Demosthenes. But this rejoinder does not help us
much, for in the earliest days of Greek history, in the legal codes of
Solon and Lycurgus, we find the most notable and clear indications
that precisely in respect of sexual relationship, and more especially
in regard to marriage and the procreation of children, the morals of
this fresh and youthful race were disordered to the greatest possible
extent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same do we find it at the time of the Italian renascence
and at the time of the Hohenstaufen dynasty&mdash;a complete confusion
of sexual relationships. The eighteenth century, also, notwithstanding
all the justified jeremiads of Rousseau regarding the widespread
unnaturalness of the time, and notwithstanding all the sorrows of the
young Werther, was distinguished by the production of an incredible
abundance of men of genius; and in contemporary France, the country
which was most severely affected by this moral decay, there flourished
the generation to which such men as Mirabeau and Napoleon belonged&mdash;men
whose unparalleled vitality influences us to this moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, I must refer to two leading authors of recent years,
Eli Metchnikoff and Georg Hirth, whose writings exhibit a remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page461">[461]</span>
similarity in respect of general philosophical foundation.
Both have energetically opposed the unfounded fantasies of
degeneration (there exists also a <b>justified</b> campaign against the
continuously effective causes of degeneration in the form of
alcohol, syphilis, etc.), and both have advocated a belief in life
and in the life-force.</p>

<p>In his work &#8220;The Nature of Man&#8221; (English translation by
Chalmers Mitchell; Heinemann, 1903), Metchnikoff advances an
&#8220;optimistic philosophy,&#8221; in opposition to the pessimistic degenerative
theory of our time, of which latter P. J. M&ouml;bius may
be regarded as the chief advocate, and he proves how the imperfections
and &#8220;disharmonies&#8221; of the human organism may
give place to a further development and perfectibility of human
nature, and this <b>precisely in connexion with culture and civilization.
It is now that humanity first begins really to</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>live.</b><a id="FNanchor468"></a><a href="#Footnote468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></span>
Mankind has not degenerated in consequence of civilization, but
has, on the contrary, by means of civilization, first attained the
possibility of establishing &#8220;physiological old age&#8221; and &#8220;physiological
death.&#8221; Our device is not <b>backwards</b>, but <b>forwards</b>!
The pessimists cry out: &#8220;Existence has no meaning! For what
purpose do we live, and for what purpose do we die?&#8221; This
dreadful &#8220;<b>for what purpose</b>&#8221; with which Friedrich von Hellwald
concludes his history of civilization, disturbs day by day emotional
minds. Metchnikoff proves that this problem is connected with
the existence of the disharmonies of human nature. But evolution
continues to transform these disharmonies into harmonies
(&#8220;orthobiosis&#8221;). Thus the aim of human existence lies in &#8220;the
completion of the entire physiological cycle of life with a normal
old age, so that, with the cessation of the instinct to live, and
with the appearance of the instinct for natural death, the cycle
comes to an end.&#8221; This is, to a certain extent, the <b>scientific</b>
formulation of the &#8220;superman&#8221; of Nietzsche, who based upon
quite similar considerations his opposition to the hypothesis of
degeneration, and who, out of the disharmonies, imperfections,
and pains of life, also created the conviction of a progressive
evolution, and thus, like Metchnikoff, thoroughly <b>affirmed</b> life.
Metchnikoff&#8217;s ideal human being of the future is realizable,
but only by means of the principles of science and intelligent
culture.</p>

<p>Similar views to those of Metchnikoff are advanced by Georg
Hirth. He, above all, has introduced into science the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page462">[462]</span>
felicitous conception of &#8220;<b>hereditary</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>enfranchisement</b>.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor469"></a><a href="#Footnote469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></span>
Thus to
the pessimistic degeneration theories and the psychical paralysis
evoked by the idea of &#8220;hereditary taint&#8221; (we now hear the expression
from every mouth), Hirth opposes a <b>word of power</b>, a
word expressing &#8220;an energetic opposing stream of tendency.&#8221;
Thus the incontestable fact finds simple expression, that</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The requirements of all individuals through millions of generations
<b>constitute an inalienable, progressively influential common
possession of the whole of humanity</b>, an <b>impulsive force</b> based upon
natural law, which marches victoriously forward over the sins and
failures of individuals.... That is to say, that in our entire organism,
so long as it continues to <b>live</b>, in addition to the disturbing influences
which we have inherited or have acquired by our own faults, there
exists also a mass of <b>old</b> and <b>new</b> constructive influences, which work
towards the <b>restitution of the former condition</b>.... <b>Enfranchisement</b>
by means of primevally old, healthy, and strong reproductive
cells is stronger than the quite recent <b>tainting</b> by means of weakly and
diseased germs. If it were not so, the entire human race would long
since have passed away, for there can hardly exist a single family tree
at the foot of which there are not somewhere worms gnawing.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>I cannot here examine more closely the extremely interesting
foundation of this view, which rightly places in the foreground
the capacity for <b>self-regeneration</b>, for the removal of morbid
vital stimuli, and their replacement by new and healthy vital
stimuli, and which notably limits the extension of hereditary
&#8220;tainting.&#8221; The conclusion which Hirth draws from this view
is identical with that of Metchnikoff&mdash;namely, <b>that our life
remains capable of upward progress</b>, a view which Hirth everywhere
happily employs in his battle &#8220;with the forces of obscurity
and degeneration.&#8221;</p>

<p>The theory of degeneration finds a thorough scientific
refutation also in the admirable work by Dr. William Hirsch,
&#8220;Genius and Degeneration: a Psychological Study&#8221; (Berlin
and Leipzig, 1904). At the end of the book (p. 340) the
writer says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In view of the investigations I have made, we are necessarily led
to the conclusion that the authors mentioned have <b>by no means</b>
adduced proof of a general degeneration of the civilized nations.
Humanity need not be alarmed with regard to the alleged &#8216;black
plague of degeneration,&#8217; and the world need be as little concerned by
these fables of the &#8216;twilight of the nations&#8217; as by Herr Falb&#8217;s prophecies
of the approaching destruction of our planet.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page463">[463]</span></p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the wide diffusion of the deleterious
means of sensual gratification (alcohol, tobacco, etc.), the
increase in the number of large towns, and the rapid growth
in their population, by means of which prostitution and the
spread of venereal diseases are especially favoured, constitute
important etiological factors for the degeneration of the race.
Still, the wide diffusion of public hygiene, which is more and
more brought under the notice of the individual, affords here
an effective counterpoise. &#8220;Enfranchisement&#8221; in Hirth&#8217;s sense
is here clearly manifested.</p>

<p>After we have seen that the &#8220;degeneration&#8221; of our time, to
the medical idea of which we shall return to speak more exactly
in the next chapter, is not greater now than it was in earlier
epochs, and that sexual anomalies have always existed, let us
return to consider this point, to the anthropological view of
psychopathia sexualis.</p>

<p>In my &#8220;Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis&#8221; I have collected
the general human phenomena of the sexual impulse in primitive
and civilized states&mdash;that is, the everywhere recurring fundamental
lineaments and phenomena of the <i>vita sexualis</i> peculiar
to the <i>genus homo</i> as such.</p>

<p>As the principal result of this inquiry, the following propositions
appear to me to be established:</p>

<p><b>Degeneration cannot be employed, as von Krafft-Ebing has
employed it in his &#8220;Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221; as a heuristic principle
in the investigation, recognition, and judgment of sexual
aberrations and perversions.</b></p>

<p>At the most, degeneration is no more than a <b>favouring</b>
factor of the diffusion of sexual abnormalities, an influence
which <b>increases the frequency</b> of their appearance.</p>

<p><b>On the contrary, the ultimate cause of all sexual perversions,
aberrations, abnormalities, and irrationalities, is the need for
variety in sexual relationships peculiar to the genus homo, which
is to be regarded as a physiological phenomenon, and the increase
of which to the degree of a sexual irritable hunger is competent to
produce the most severe sexual perversions.</b></p>

<p>In contrast with this, &#8220;degeneration&#8221; or diseases play only
a subordinate part, and can be invoked for the explanation of
only a small number of sexual aberrations&mdash;at most for those
which come to the notice of physicians on account of pathological
conditions or <i>in foro</i>. In fact, the <b>majority</b> of cases of sexual
perversions which come the way of the physicians in clinical or
forensic relationships <b>are</b> pathological, but these constitute only<span class="pagenum" id="Page464">[464]</span>
a <b>minority of all cases</b>. The large majority of cases do <b>not</b> come
within the scope of <span class="nowrap">degeneration.<a id="FNanchor470"></a><a href="#Footnote470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>Freud, in his &#8220;Three Essays on the Sexual Theory,&#8221; recognizes
the justice of my view, and on p. 80 he writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Physicians who have first studied perversions in well-marked
examples and peculiar conditions are naturally inclined to regard them
as signs of disease or as stigmata of degeneration, just as in the case of
sexual inversion. Daily experience has shown that the majority of
these transgressions&mdash;at any rate, the less marked of them&mdash;constitute
a seldom lacking constituent of the sexual life of healthy persons.
In favourable conditions <b>the normal individual may exhibit such a
perversion for a considerable length of time in the place of his normal
sexual activity; or the perversion may take its place beside the normal
sexual activity. Probably there is no healthy person in whom there
does not exist, at some time or other, some kind of supplement to his
normal sexual activity, to which we should be justified in giving the
name of</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>&#8216;perversity.&#8217;</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor471"></a><a href="#Footnote471"
class="fnanchor">[471]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A <b>second</b> important factor in the genesis of sexual anomalies
is the <b>ease with which the sexual impulse is affected by external
influences, the associative inclusion of manifold external stimuli
in sexual perception itself</b>, the &#8220;<b>syn&aelig;sthetic stimuli</b>,&#8221; as I myself
have called them, in the amatory life of mankind. In this way
gradually all the relations of art, religion, fashion, etc., to sexuality
have developed, and they offer, in conjunction with the
sensory impressions and the psychical and physical imaginative
associations which accompany the sexual act, an incredibly rich
material for the manifold realizations of the sexual need for
variation.</p>

<p>The need for variety in sexual relationships, in conjunction
with the sexual &#8220;demand for stimulation&#8221;
<span class="nowrap">(Hoche),<a id="FNanchor472"></a><a href="#Footnote472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></span> plays a
great part, especially in the occurrence of sexual perversions in
<b>adult</b> persons and at a more advanced age of life. The effect of
<b>external influences</b> is most clearly noticeable in <b>childhood</b>, when
it is experienced most deeply and in a most enduring manner, and
when it can become permanently associated with sexual perception
(Binet and von Schrenck-Notzing).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page465">[465]</span></p>

<p>Alexander von Humboldt, in his &#8220;Cosmos&#8221; (vol. ii., Introduction),
drew attention to the well-known experience that
&#8220;<b>sensual impressions and apparently chance occurrences are,
in the case of youthful emotional individuals, often capable of
determining the entire course of a human life</b>.&#8221; Freud draws
attention to the psychological fact that impressions of childhood,
which have apparently been forgotten, may, notwithstanding,
have left the most profound marks upon our psychical life, and
may have determined our entire subsequent development. The
impressions of childhood are often incorporated fate. For this
reason, for example, the children of criminals become criminals
themselves, not because they are &#8220;born&#8221; criminals, but because,
as <b>children</b>, they grow up in the atmosphere of crime, and the
impressions they here receive become firmly and deeply rooted
in their natures. Hence the campaign against crime must in the
first place take into consideration the <b>education of the children
of criminals</b>!</p>

<p>From the need for variety in sexual relationships, and from
the effect of external influences, we deduce the possibility and the
actual frequency of the <b>acquirement</b> and the <b>artificial production</b>
of sexual perversions and perversities; and these, in proportion
to the <b>intensity</b> of the sexual impulse (<b>very variable</b> in
strength in different individuals, according to the ease with which
it is excited), will appear now earlier, now later, will be now
transient and now enduring.</p>

<p>The <b>third</b> important etiological factor in the origination of
sexual perversions is the <b>frequent repetition</b> of the <b>same</b> sexual
aberration. There can be no doubt whatever that the normal
human being can become <b>accustomed</b> to the most diverse sexual
aberrations, so that these become perversions, which appear in
<b>healthy</b> human beings just as they do in the diseased.</p>

<p><b>Fourthly</b>, <b>suggestion</b> and <b>imitation</b> play an extremely important
r?e in the <i>vita sexualis</i> alike of primitive and of civilized nations,
in accordance with which certain aberrations in the sexual
sphere become diffused with great rapidity, and make their
appearance as customs, fashions, and psychical epidemics.
Those who everywhere trace perversities from morbid rudiments
underestimate the powerful influence which <b>example</b> and <b>seduction</b>
exercise in the human sexual life. This is especially noticeable
to-day in those sexual perversions which have become
<b>national customs</b>. The most celebrated example is that of
<b>Hellenic p&aelig;derasty</b>, reputedly introduced from Crete, but probably
in the first place originated by a few <b>genuinely</b> homosexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page466">[466]</span>
individuals, who in their own interest transmitted artificially by
suggestion their peculiar tendencies to a few heterosexual individuals,
until at last the love of boys became a national custom
which every heterosexual man adopted. The momentous part
which modern <b>prostitution</b>, and more especially <b>brothels</b>, plays
in the suggestion of perversions has already been mentioned. It
is a matter to which we shall frequently have occasion to return.
Schrank alludes (&#8220;Prostitution in Vienna,&#8221; vol. i., p. 285) to
a prostitute who enjoyed a &#8220;European reputation&#8221; as an artist
in sexual perversities of every kind, and who enjoyed the nickname
of &#8220;the Ever-Virgin,&#8221; because she allowed men every
possible kind of enjoyment except that of regular normal
intercourse (which she avoided for fear of becoming impregnated).</p>

<p><b>Fifthly</b>, the <b>difference</b> between man and woman in the essence,
the kind, and the intensity, of sexual perception (sexual activity
in man, sexual passivity in woman) constitutes a rich source of
sexual aberrations, most of which belong to the provinces of
masochism and sadism.</p>

<p><b>Sixthly</b>, and lastly, in otherwise <b>healthy individuals there
occur at a very early age</b>, and probably in consequence of <b>congenital</b>
conditions, changes in the direction and the aim of sexual
perception, variations from the type of differentiated heterosexual
love. <b>Genuine homosexuality</b> is the principal phenomenon
to be considered under this head. It occurs in perfectly <b>healthy</b>
individuals quite independently of degeneration and of civilization;
and it is diffused throughout the whole world.</p>

<p>From all these facts may be deduced the <b>untenability</b> of a
purely <b>clinical and pathological</b> conception of sexual aberrations
and perversions. We must now accept the point of view that,
although numerous morbid degenerate and psychopathic individuals
exhibit sexual anomalies, yet these <b>identical</b> anomalies
and aberrations are extraordinarily common in <b>healthy</b> persons.</p>

<p>Ethnological research, for more exact details of which I may
refer to my own work already mentioned, and to the pioneer
works of <span class="nowrap">Ploss-Bartels,<a id="FNanchor473"></a><a href="#Footnote473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></span>
Mantegazza,<a id="FNanchor474"></a><a href="#Footnote474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
Friedrich S. <span class="nowrap">Krauss,<a id="FNanchor475"></a><a href="#Footnote475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></span> and
Havelock <span class="nowrap">Ellis,<a id="FNanchor476"></a><a href="#Footnote476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></span>
has adduced stringent proof that sexual aberrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page467">[467]</span>
and perversions are <b>ubiquitous</b>, diffused throughout the
entire world, just as much among primitive races as among
civilized nations, that on the psycho-physical side they are
&#8220;elementary ideas&#8221; in Bastian&#8217;s sense, that they recur everywhere
in a qualitatively identical manner as a result of similar
conditions. As it is with prostitution, so it is also with sexual
perversions&mdash;a tendency to sexual aberration is deeply rooted
in human nature. It is a primitive, purely anthropological
phenomenon, which is not strengthened by civilization, but,
on the contrary, is mitigated thereby. Charles Darwin rightly
points out that the <b>hatred</b> of sexual immorality and of sexual
aberrations is a &#8220;modern virtue,&#8221; appertaining exclusively to
&#8220;civilized life,&#8221; and entirely foreign to the nature of primitive
man. Primitive man revelled in wild indecency (as Wilhelm
Roscher also proves), in sexual perversions, and
<span class="nowrap">libertinism.<a id="FNanchor477"></a><a href="#Footnote477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></span>
The sexual aberrations of civilized mankind are for the most
part <b>imitations</b> of the examples given by primitive peoples.</p>

<p>Thus, the well-known &#8220;stimulating rings&#8221; of European rubber
manufacturers (<i>cf.</i> Weissenberg, in the &#8220;Transactions of the
Anthropological Society of Berlin,&#8221; 1893, p. 135) correspond to
the &#8220;stimulating stones&#8221; of the Battaks (Staudinger, <i>op. cit.</i>,
1891, p. 351), to the &#8220;penis stones&#8221; of the savage Orang Sinnoi
in Malacca (Vaughan Stevens in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Ethnologie</i>,
1896, pp. 181, 182), the &#8220;ampallang&#8221; of the Sunda Islands
(see Miklucho-Maclay in the &#8220;Transactions of the Anthropological
Society of Berlin,&#8221; 1876, pp. 22-28). The &#8220;renifleurs&#8221;
and &#8220;gamahucheurs&#8221; of the Parisian brothels and houses of
accommodation find their typical analogues in the urine fetichists
and cunnilingi of the Island of Ponape, in the Carolines (<i>cf.</i>
Ploss-Bartels), who are, in truth, far removed from the <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i>
life. And what a perverse imagination have the women
of this same island! According to Otto Finsch (<i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
Ethnologie</i>, 1880, p. 316), the men of this island have all only
<b>one</b> testicle, because in boys at the age of seven or eight years
the left testicle is removed by a piece of sharpened bamboo.
This is said to make the men more desirable <b>to the women</b>!
Among the Masai, for similar reasons, circumcision is effected
in such a manner that a portion of the prepuce is left behind
to form a kind of firm button of skin. &#8220;This mode of circumcision
is greatly prized by the women. Among the black races,
indeed, everything turns round the question of sensual enjoyment<span class="pagenum" id="Page468">[468]</span>&#8221;
(&#8220;Medical Notes from Central Africa,&#8221; by M. C., published
in the <i>Deutsche Medizinische Presse</i>, 1902, No. 14, p. 116). And
how can our rou&eacute;s compete with the Tauni islanders of the South
Seas? These select certain women, who are not allowed to marry,
but are reserved as simple &#8220;objects of sensual pleasure,&#8221; and
with these every kind of sexual artifice is practised (Dempwolf,
&#8220;Medical Notes on the Tauni Islanders,&#8221; published in the
<i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Ethnologie</i>, 1902, p. 335).</p>

<p>Thus between primitive and civilized races in these respects
there are no important differences; and according to recent
researches we find the same may be said with regard to civilized
nations, that there is no difference between <b>town</b> and
<span class="nowrap"><b>country</b>.<a id="FNanchor478"></a><a href="#Footnote478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></span>
I quote here the account given by an experienced author sixty
years ago:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;People usually believe that in the country morals are much better
than in the towns, but this belief is quite erroneous. Brothels and
professional prostitutes naturally cannot exist in the country, but
nearly every peasant-girl in the country is equivalent to a secret
prostitute. It is incredible what sexual excesses go on between the
masculine and feminine inhabitants of the villages. Every barn, every
shed, every haystack, every copse, bears witness to this. Especially
disadvantageous to morals is it when in the heat of summer persons
of different sexes work side by side, half undressed, in remote fields
for the whole day, and lie down to rest side by
<span class="nowrap">side.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor479"></a><a href="#Footnote479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>We may here allude to a fact that we shall have to discuss
later&mdash;that young men, after the conclusion of their term of
military service, carry back with them to the country the
knowledge of sexual excesses and perversities which they have
acquired in the town, and thus diffuse these tendencies more and
more widely.</p>

<p>Since sexual anomalies constitute a phenomenon generally
characteristic of humanity, <b>race</b> and <b>nationality</b>, as such, have
less to do with the matter than is commonly imagined. The
Mongol and the Malay are not less voluptuous than the Semites,
or than many Aryan races. Among the Semites, the Arabs and
the Turks are pre-eminently sexually perverse nations. They seek
sexual gratification indifferently in the female harem and in the
boys&#8217; brothel (see numerous descriptions of travellers on the moral
customs of Turkey, the Levant, Cairo, Morocco, the Arabian
Soudan, the Arabs in Africa, etc.). Among the Aryan races the<span class="pagenum" id="Page469">[469]</span>
Aryans of India must be considered pre-eminent as refined
practitioners of psychopathia sexualis, which they have reduced
to a <b>system</b>. In addition to recognizing forty-eight <i>figur&aelig;
Veneris</i> (different postures in sexual intercourse), they practise
every possible variety of sexual perversion; and they have
in various <span class="nowrap">textbooks<a id="FNanchor480"></a><a href="#Footnote480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></span>
a systematic introduction to sexual immorality.
Here there is manifestly no trace of morbid conditions,
of degeneration, or of psychopathia; it is simply a matter
of popular manners and customs. Sexual perversion among the
Greeks and the Romans, two other Aryan nations, is too well
known to need detailed description. In modern Europe the
French were at one time believed to lead the way in sexual
artifices. For a long time this has ceased to be true, and, in fact,
never was true. They do, indeed, excel, if one may use the
expression, all other nations in the outward technique and in
the elegance of their sexual excesses. To them from very early
times there has been ascribed a certain preference for the skatological
element in the sexual life; but according to the recent
researches of Friedrich S. Krauss regarding the Slavs, published
in his &#8220;Anthropophyteia,&#8221; this alleged pre-eminence is
extremely doubtful. That among the Slavs sexual perversions
of every kind have an extraordinarily wide diffusion has been
shown by this investigator by the collection of an enormous mass
of material. It is also very generally known that the English
from early days have exhibited a marked tendency to sadistic
practices, and especially to flagellation. I will return later to this
remarkable phenomenon. The French accuse the Germans of an
especial tendency to homosexuality (<i>le vice Allemand</i>), but there
are no sufficient grounds for this accusation. In psychopathia
sexualis, the Germans are as cosmopolitan as they are in other
respects.</p>

<p>With regard to the <b>age</b> of the individual in relation to sexual
perversions, the frequency of these is greater after puberty than
<span class="nowrap">before,<a id="FNanchor481"></a><a href="#Footnote481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></span>
and the frequency increases with advancing years. The
time at which the imagination unfolds its greatest activity, the
commencement of manhood, is extremely favourable to the
origination of sexual aberrations, and to their becoming habitual
practices; and, again, the age at which the sexual powers
begin to decline, and when for their incitation new stimuli are<span class="pagenum" id="Page470">[470]</span>
needed, is one at which abnormal varieties of sexual gratification
frequently <span class="nowrap">originate.<a id="FNanchor482"></a><a href="#Footnote482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>Which <b>sex</b> is more inclined to abnormalities of the sexual impulse,
the male or the female?</p>

<p>The primitively more powerful sexual impulsive life of man in
association with his greater use of alcohol makes him distinctly
more inclined to follow sexual bypaths than woman, whose
sexuality at first develops very gradually, and experiences, in
consequence of motherhood, powerful inhibitions to the development
of any sexual anomalies. On the other hand, the much
<b>more difficult development</b> of voluptuous sensations in women,
by means of normal coitus, is not rarely the cause of a tendency
to perverse varieties of sexual intercourse. They often seduce
man in this direction, and excel him in the discovery of sexual
artifices. Among primitive races, where the relationships are
clearest, this is still easily recognizable, whereas by civilization
the matter is often obscured. All the artificial deformities of
the male genital organs amongst savages, which give the man
much more trouble than pleasure, but which, on the other hand,
increase the voluptuous enjoyment of the woman during the
sexual act, cannot otherwise be explained except on the ground
of an original demand on the part of women. To this category
belong incisions in the glans penis, and the implanting of small
stones in the wounds until the skin has a warty appearance
(Java); perforation of the penis to enable rods beset with bristles,
feathers, rods with balls (the well-known &#8220;ampallang&#8221; of the
Dyaks of Borneo), bodkins, rings, bell-shaped apparatus, to be
inserted through these perforations; the wrapping up of the
penis in strips of fur with the hair outwards, or enveloping it in
a leaden cylinder, etc. The feminine imagination has proved
inexhaustible in this direction. Miklucho-Maclay, the great
authority on the sexual psychology of the savage races of the
Malay Archipelago and the South Sea Islands, declares it to be
extremely probable <b>that all these customs and all these apparatus
were invented by or for women</b>. The women reject all men
who do not possess these stimulating apparatus on the penis.
Finsch and Kubary confirm this, and state that in most cases
it is the frigidity of the women which makes them desire such
means of artificial stimulation. Among civilized races, also,
abundant material can be collected with regard to sexual perversities<span class="pagenum" id="Page471">[471]</span>
among women, as has recently been done by Paul de
R&eacute;gla in &#8220;Les Perversit&eacute;s de la Femme&#8221; (Paris, 1904), and by
Ren&eacute; Schwaebl&eacute; in &#8220;Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es de Paris&#8221; (Paris, 1904).</p>

<p>The following case shows that European women sometimes
demand artificial changes in the male genital organs, in order
to increase their voluptuous sensations. Some years ago a
man, fifty years of age, was admitted into the syphilis wards of
the Laibacher Hospital. The discharge from the penis was,
however, found to be due merely to balanitis. On examination the
greatly enlarged penis was found to be perforated by rod-shaped
objects, and an incision through the skin showed that these were
pins and hairpins. The pins were about two inches long, with
brass heads the size of a peppercorn, and they were at least
ten in number. One of the pins was run partly into the testicle.
After the foreign objects had been removed, the man informed
us that his mistress had stuck these in, in order that she
might experience more ardent sensations. The pins were all
subcutaneous; several of them ran right round the penis.</p>

<p><b>Social differences</b> in respect of the frequency of sexual perversions
do not exist. Sexual perversions are just as widely
diffused among the lower classes as among the upper. A. Ferguson,
Havelock Ellis, Tarnowsky, and J. A. Symonds are all in agreement
regarding this fact, which, indeed, in view of the anthropological
conception of psychopathia sexualis, does not require
additional explanation.</p>

<p>Finally, we come to the last and most important point&mdash;to the
question of the relation of <b>culture</b> and <b>civilization</b> to psychopathia
sexualis. Even though psychopathia sexualis is in its <b>essence</b>
independent of culture, is a general human phenomenon, still we
cannot fail to recognize that civilization has exercised a certain
influence upon the external mode of manifestation, and also
upon the inner psychical configuration of sexual aberrations.
Especially as regards the latter&mdash;the psychical relationships&mdash;the
perversity of the civilized man is more complicated than that of
primitive man, although in <b>essence</b> the two are identical.</p>

<p>The modern civilized man is in respect of his sexuality a peculiar
<b>dual being</b>. The sexuality within him leads a kind of independent
existence, notwithstanding its intimate relationship to the whole
of the rest of his spiritual life. There are moments in which, even
in men of lofty spiritual nature, pure sexuality becomes separated
from love, and manifests itself in its utterly elementary
nature beyond good and evil. I expressed earlier the idea that
this frequent phenomenon reminded me of the &#8220;monomania<span class="pagenum" id="Page472">[472]</span>&#8221;
of the older alienists. &#8220;Il y a en nous deux &ecirc;tres, l&#8217;&ecirc;tre moral
et la b&ecirc;te: l&#8217;&ecirc;tre moral sait ce que m&eacute;rite l&#8217;amour v&eacute;ritable, la
b&ecirc;te aspire &agrave; la fange o&ugrave; on la pousse,&#8221; we find in a French
erotic work (&#8220;Impressions d&#8217;une Fille&#8221; par L&eacute;na de Mauregard,
vol. i., pp. 57, 68; Paris, 1900).</p>

<p>No other human impulsive manifestation is so ill adapted as
sexuality to the <b>coercion</b> and <b>conventionality</b> which civilization
necessarily entails. Carl Hauptmann, in an interesting socio-psychological
study, &#8220;Unsere Wirklichkeit&#8221; (&#8220;Our Reality&#8221;;
Munich, 1902), has described very impressively this frightful
conventionality, especially characteristic of our own time, which
so painfully represses the &#8220;reality&#8221; of love, suppresses everything
primitive in it, banishes it into the darkness of its own
interior, and only allows the conventionally sanctioned forms of
sexual love to subsist. This coercion, this outward pressure,
develops a volcano of elementary sexuality, which usually
slumbers, but may suddenly break out in eruption, and give
free vent to excesses of the wildest nature. Dingelstedt in his
poem &#8220;Ein Roman,&#8221; has excellently described this condition:</p>

<p>Similarly, Charles <span class="nowrap">Albert<a id="FNanchor483"></a><a href="#Footnote483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></span>
remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;If love nowadays so often manifests itself in the form of aberration
or passion, this is almost always to be explained by the hindrances
of every kind which have been opposed to it. No other feeling is so
hindered, opposed, detested, and loaded with material and moral
fetters. We know how education makes a beginning in this way,
declaring that love is something forbidden, and how the hardness of
economic life continues the process. Hardly has a young man or a
young girl gone out into life, hardly have they begun to feel their way<span class="pagenum" id="Page473">[473]</span>
into society, but they encounter a thousand difficulties which are
opposed to their living out their life from a sexual point of view. How
would it be possible that, in the limits of such a society, love could
become anything else but a fixed idea of the individual, and how could
it fail to give rise to continuous restlessness? Nature does not allow
herself to be inhibited by our artificial social arrangements. The
need for love within us remains active; it cries out in unsatisfied desire;
and when no answer is forthcoming, beyond the echo of its own
pain, it takes a perverse form. The love which is prevented from
obtaining complete satisfaction and repose is to many an intensely
painful torment.... The over-rich imagination and the unsatisfied
longing give rise to the most horrible and abnormal forms of love.
Above all, in a society which will make no room for love, the love-passion
must give rise to the greatest devastation. The impulse to
love which is repressed by the organization of society does not only
fight violently for air&mdash;the inevitable consequence of any pressure&mdash;but
it discovers also all those artifices and corruptions which are supposed
to make the enjoyment of love more intense. Conscious of
being despised by society, it endeavours to regain by violence what is
wanting to it in sensuality.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The struggle for reality in love, for the elementary and the
primitive, manifests itself in the search for the greatest possible
<b>contrast</b> to the conventional, to the commonly sanctioned mode
of sexual activity. Love cries out for &#8220;nature,&#8221; and comes
thereby to the &#8220;unnatural,&#8221; to the <b>coarsest, commonest</b> dissipation.
This connexion has been already explained (pp. 322-325).
Certain temporary phenomena exhibit also this fact&mdash;for example,
the remarkable preference for the most brutal, the coarsest,
the commonest dances, mere limb dislocations, such as the
cancan, the croquette (machicha), the cake-walk, and other wild
negro dances, which rejoice the modern public more than the
most beautiful and gracious spiritual ballet. It was only when
the above-described connexion became clear to me that I was
able to understand the remarkable alluring power of these dances,
which had hitherto been incomprehensible to me.</p>

<p>An additional factor which favours the origination of sexual
perversions is the <b>unrest</b> always connected with the advance of
civilization, the haste and hurry, the more severe struggle for
existence, the rapid and frequent change of new impressions.
Fifty years ago the celebrated alienist Guislain exclaimed:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;What is it with which our thoughts are filled? Plans, novelties,
reforms. What is it that we Europeans are striving for? Movement,
excitement. What do we obtain? Stimulation, illusion,
<span class="nowrap">deception.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor484"></a><a href="#Footnote484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page474">[474]</span></p>

<p>There is no longer any time for quiet, enduring love, for an
inward profundity of feeling, for the culture of the <b>heart</b>. The
struggle for life and the intellectual contest of our time leaves the
possibility only for transient sensations; the shorter they are,
the more <b>violent</b>, the more intense must they be, in order to
replace the failing <i>grande passion</i> of former times. Love
becomes a mere <b>sensation</b>, which in a brief moment must contain
within itself an entire world. Modern youth eagerly desires such
<b>experience</b> of a whole world by means of love. The everlasting
feeling of our classic period had been transformed, more especially
among our leading spirits, into a passionate yearning to reflect
within themselves truly the spirit of the time, to live through
in themselves all the unrest, all the joy, all the sorrow, of modern
civilization.</p>

<p>From this there results a peculiar, more spiritual configuration
of modern perversity, a distinctive spiritualization of psychopathia
sexualis, a true wandering journey, an &#8220;Odyssey&#8221; of the
spirit, throughout the wide province of sexual excesses. Without
doubt the French have gone furthest in this direction, and the
names of Baudelaire, Barbey d&#8217;Aurevilly, Verlaine, Hannon,
Haraucourt, Jean Larocque, and Guy de Maupassant, indicate
nearly as many peculiar spiritual refinements and enrichments
of the purely sensual life.</p>

<p>We have no longer to deal with the pure love of reflection, as
in the case of Kierkegaard and Grillparzer, and in the writings of
young Germany, where, indeed, reflection predominates, but
which still more extends to the direction of <b>higher love</b>. Contrasted
with this is the <b>simple lust of the senses</b>, by means of
which new psychical influences are to be obtained. Voluptuousness
becomes a cerebral phenomenon, ethereal. In this way the
most remarkable, unheard-of, sensory associations appear in
the province of sexuality&mdash;true <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> products which are,
above all, specifically <b>modern</b>, and could not possibly exist in
former times. For it is always the same play of emotion, the
same effects, the same terminal results: ordinary voluptuousness.
The dream of Hermann Bahr, of &#8220;non-sexual voluptuousness,&#8221;
and the replacement of the animal impulse by means of finer
organs, is only a dream. The elemental sexual impulse resists
every attempt at dismemberment and sublimation. It returns
always unaltered, always the same. It is vain to expect new
manifestations of this impulse. Such efforts end either in bodily
and mental impotence, or else in sexual perversities. In these
relationships the imagination of civilized man is unable to create<span class="pagenum" id="Page475">[475]</span>
novelties in the <b>essence</b>; it can do so only as regards the objective
<b>manifestations</b>. This is confirmed by the increase of purely
ideal sexual perversities in connexion with certain spiritual
tendencies of our time. Martial d&#8217;Estoc, in his book, &#8220;Paris
Eros&#8221; (Paris, 1903), has given a clear description of these peculiar
spiritual modifications of sexual aberrations. (It is interesting to
note that Schopenhauer remarks, in his &#8220;Neue Paralipomena,&#8221;
pp. 234 and 235: &#8220;The caprices arising from the sexual impulse
resemble a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp. They deceive us most effectively;
but if we follow them, they lead us into the marsh and disappear.&#8221;)</p>

<h3>APPENDIX<br />
SEXUAL PERVERSIONS DUE TO DISEASE</h3>

<p>It is the immortal service of Casper and von Krafft-Ebing to
have insisted energetically upon the fact that <b>numerous</b> individuals
whose <i>vita sexualis</i> is abnormal are persons suffering from
<b>disease</b>. This is their <i>monumentum &aelig;re perennius</i> in the history
of medicine and of civilization. Purely medical, anatomical,
physical, and psychiatric investigations show beyond question
that there are many persons whose abnormal sexual life is pathologically
based.</p>

<p>I shall not here discuss the peculiar <b>borderland state between
health and disease</b>, the existence of which can be established in
many sexually perverse individuals; I shall not refer to the
&#8220;abnormalities,&#8221; the &#8220;psychopathic deficiencies,&#8221; the &#8220;unbalanced,&#8221;
etc.; nor shall I discuss the question of the significance
of the stigmata of degeneration, because these will be adequately
dealt with in connexion with the forensic consideration of punishable
sexual perversions.</p>

<p>Here we shall speak only of actual and easily determined
diseases which possess a causal importance in the origination and
activity of sexual perversions. The great majority of these are,
naturally, <b>mental disorders</b>.</p>

<p>Von Krafft-Ebing, to whom we owe the most important
observations regarding the pathological etiology of sexual perversions,
enumerates the following conditions: Psychical developmental
inhibitions (idiocy and imbecility), acquired weak-mindedness
(after mental disorders, apoplexy, injuries to the
head, syphilis, in consequence of general paralysis), epilepsy,
periodical insanity, mania, melancholia, hysteria, paranoia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page476">[476]</span></p>

<p>Among these, <b>epilepsy</b> possesses the greatest
<span class="nowrap">importance.<a id="FNanchor485"></a><a href="#Footnote485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></span> It
comes into play <b>much more frequently</b> as a causal morbid influence
in the case of sexually perverse actions and offences than
has hitherto been believed. The psychiatrist Arndt maintains
that wherever an abnormal sexual life exists, we must always
consider the possibility of epileptic influence. Lombroso assumes
that all premature and peculiar instances of satyriasis are instances
of larval epilepsy. He gives several examples in support
of this view, and also a case of Macdonald&#8217;s which illustrates
the connexion between epilepsy and sexual
<span class="nowrap">perversity.<a id="FNanchor486"></a><a href="#Footnote486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></span> Especially
in the so-called epileptic &#8220;confusional states&#8221; do we meet with
sexually perverse actions; exhibitionism and other manifestations
of sexual activity <i>coram publico</i> are frequently referable to
epileptic disease. Similar impulsive sexual activities and similar
confusional states are seen after <b>injuries to the head</b> and in
<b>alcoholic intoxication</b>, also after <b>severe exhaustion</b>. Many cases
of &#8220;<b>periodic psychopathia sexualis</b>&#8221; are due to epilepsy.</p>

<p><b>Senile dementia</b> and <b>paralytic dementia</b> (general paralysis of
the insane), also severe forms of <b>neurasthenia</b> and <b>hysteria</b>, often
change the sexual life in a morbid direction, and favour the
origin of sexual perversions.</p>

<p>It is a fact of great interest that Tarnowsky and Freud attribute
to <b>syphilis</b> an important r&ocirc;le in the pathogenesis of sexual
anomalies. In 50&nbsp;% of his sexual pathological cases Freud
found that the abnormal sexual constitution was to be regarded
as the last manifestation of a syphilitic inheritance (Freud,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 74). Tarnowsky observed that congenital syphilitics,
and also persons whose parents had been syphilitic, but who
themselves had never exhibited any definite symptoms of the
disease, were apt later to show manifestations of a perverse sexual
sensibility (Tarnowsky, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 34 and 35). <b>Obviously this
is to be explained by the deleterious influence upon the nervous
system (perhaps by means of toxins?) which syphilis is also supposed
to exert in the causation of tabes dorsalis and general
paralysis of the insane.</b> When investigating the clinical history
of cases of sexual perversion, it appears that previous syphilis
is a fact to which some importance should be
<span class="nowrap">attached.<a id="FNanchor487"></a><a href="#Footnote487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page477">[477]</span></p>

<p>From syphilis we pass to consider direct <b>physical</b> abnormalities
and <b>morbid changes in the genital organs</b> as causes of sexual
anomalies. In women prolapsus uteri sometimes leads to
perverse gratification of the sexual impulse&mdash;for example, by
<span class="nowrap">p&aelig;dication;<a id="FNanchor488"></a><a href="#Footnote488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></span>
in men, shortness of the fr&aelig;num preputii plays a
similar <span class="nowrap">part,<a id="FNanchor489"></a><a href="#Footnote489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></span>
also phimosis. Wollenmann reports the case of a
young man suffering from phimosis, who, at the first attempt at
coitus, experienced severe pain, and since that time had an
antipathy to normal sexual intercourse. He passed under the
influence of a seducer to the practice of mutual masturbation.
Only after operative treatment of the phimosis did his inclination
towards the male sex pass away, and the sexual perversion then
completely <span class="nowrap">disappeared.<a id="FNanchor490"></a><a href="#Footnote490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></span></p>

As, for example, Immermann, in his work &#8220;Epigonen,&#8221; published at the
same period (1836), assumes. In the mouth of the physician he puts the following
words: &#8220;The physician has a great task to perform in the present day.
<i>Diseases, especially nervous troubles, to which for a number of years the human
race has been especially disposed, are a modern product.</i>&#8221; <i>Cf.</i> Leopold Hirschberg,

people was &#8220;nervous&#8221;; thirty-four years before <i>Sedan</i>, thirty years after <i>Jena</i>!
Therefore neither Jena nor Sedan can be connected with the nervous &#8220;degeneration.&#8221;

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p class="noindent">Before proceeding to the consideration of homosexuality I
propose to give a brief account of contemporary misogyny, in
order to avoid confusing these two distinct phenomena under one
head, and also to avoid making the male homosexuals, who
are often erroneously regarded as &#8220;woman-haters,&#8221; responsible
for the momentarily prevalent spiritual epidemic of hatred of
women. This would be a gross injustice, because, in the first
place, this movement has <b>in no way</b> proceeded from the
homosexual, but rather from heterosexual individuals, such as
Schopenhauer, Strindberg, etc.; and because, in the second
place, the homosexual as such are not misogynists at all, and it
is only a minority of them who shout in chorus to the misogynist
tirades of Strindberg and Weininger.</p>

<p>The misogynists form to-day a kind of &#8220;<b>fourth</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>sex</b>,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor491"></a><a href="#Footnote491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></span> to
belong to which appears to be the fashion, or rather has <b>once
more</b> become the fashion, for misogyny is an old story. There
have always been times in which men have cried out: &#8220;Woman,
what have I to do with you? I belong to the
<span class="nowrap">century&#8221;;<a id="FNanchor492"></a><a href="#Footnote492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></span>
times in which woman was renounced as a soulless being, and the
world of men became intoxicated with itself, and was proud of
its &#8220;splendid isolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of less importance is it that the Chinese since ancient times
have denied to woman a soul, and therewith a justification for
<span class="nowrap">existence,<a id="FNanchor493"></a><a href="#Footnote493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></span>
than that among the most highly developed civilized
races of antiquity such men as Hesiod,
<span class="nowrap">Simonides,<a id="FNanchor494"></a><a href="#Footnote494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></span> and, above all,
Euripides, were all fierce misogynists. In the &#8220;Ion,&#8221; the
&#8220;Hippolytus,&#8221; the &#8220;Hecuba,&#8221; and the &#8220;Cyclops&#8221; we find
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page482">[482]</span>
most incisive attacks on the female sex. The most celebrated
passage is that in the &#8220;Hippolytus&#8221; (verses 602-637, 650-655):</p>

<p>In this passage we have the entire quintessence of modern
misogyny. But Euripides betrays to us also the real motive of
misogyny. In a fragment of his we read &#8220;the <b>most invincible</b>
of all things is a woman&#8221;! <i>Hinc ill&aelig; lacrim&aelig;!</i> It is only the
men who are not a <b>match</b> for woman, who do not allow woman
as a free personality to influence them, <b>who are so little sure of
themselves</b> that they are afraid of suffering at the hands of
woman damage, limitation, or even annihilation of their own
individuality. These only are the true misogynists.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that this Hellenic misogyny was closely
connected with the love of boys as a popular custom. To this
we shall return when we come to describe Greek p&aelig;derasty.</p>

<p>Among the Romans woman occupied a far higher position than
among the Greeks&mdash;a fact which the institution of the vestal
virgins alone suffices to prove. Among the Germans, also, woman
was regarded as worthy of all honour.</p>

<p>The <b>true source</b> of modern misogyny is Christianity&mdash;the
Christian doctrine of the fundamentally sinful, evil, devilish
nature of woman. A Strindberg, a Weininger, even a Benedikt
Friedl&auml;nder, notwithstanding his hatred of priests&mdash;all are the
last offshoots of a movement against the being and the value of
woman&mdash;a movement which has persisted throughout the
Christian period of the history of the world.</p>

&#8220;to name the most influential,

beauty, love, and marriage&#8217;! If I were asked, however, to name the
most inward and peculiar essence of the early middle ages, my answer

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page483">[483]</span></p>

<p>The history of medieval misogyny was described by J. Michelet
in his book &#8220;The Witch.&#8221; Since woman and the contact with
woman were regarded as radically evil, it followed that in theory
and practice asceticism was the ideal; celibacy was only the
natural consequence of this hatred of woman; so also were the
later witch trials the natural consequence. Therefore to this
medieval misogyny, in contrast with modern misogyny, which
represents only a weak imitation, we cannot deny a certain
justification. The misogyny of the middle ages was earnestly
meant; but it has become to-day mere phrase-making, dilettante
imitation, and ostentation. In contrast with the utterances of
the modern misogynist, the coarse abuse of women by such a
writer as Abraham a Santa Clara has a refreshing and amusing
<span class="nowrap">character.<a id="FNanchor497"></a><a href="#Footnote497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>Modern misogyny is certainly an inheritance of Christian
doctrine, and a tradition handed down from much earlier times,
but still it has its own characteristic peculiarities. Misogyny is,
however, now much more an affair of <b>satiety</b> or <b>disillusion</b> than
of <b>belief</b> or <b>conviction</b>; whereas in the days of medieval Christianity
belief and conviction were the effective causal factors of
misogyny. In addition, among our neo-misogynists we have the
factor of the <b>spiritual pride</b> of a man who, from the standpoint of
academic theoretical culture (which to men of this kind appears
the highest summit of existence), looks down upon women,
whom he regards as mentally insignificant, while he sympathizes
with her &#8220;physiological weak-mindedness.&#8221; He smiles on her
with pity, and completely overlooks the profound life of emotion
and feeling characteristic of every true woman, which forms a
counterpoise to any amount of purely theoretical knowledge&mdash;quite
apart from the fact that women of intellectual cultivation
are by no means rare.</p>

<p>If, in fact, we regard the <b>lives</b> of those who have reduced modern
misogyny to a system, we shall be able to detect the above-mentioned
causes in their personal experiences and impressions.
The first important modern advocate of misogyny, the Marquis
de Sade, lived an extremely unhappy married life, was deceived
also in a love relationship, and nourished his hatred of women by
a dissolute life and a consequent state of satiety.</p>

<p>And as regards Schopenhauer, who does not recall his unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page484">[484]</span>
relations with his mother? For he who has really loved his
<b>mother</b>, he who has experienced the unutterable tenderness and
self-sacrifice of maternal love, can never become a genuine,
thoroughgoing woman-hater. But the mutual relationship of
Schopenhauer and his mother was rather <b>hatred</b> than love.
Beyond question, also, his infection with syphilis, to which I was
the first to draw attention, played a part in his subsequent hatred
of women.</p>

<p>Strindberg, in his &#8220;Confessions of a Fool,&#8221; has himself offered
us the proof of the causal connexion between his misogyny and
his personal experiences and disillusions; and in Weininger&#8217;s
book we can read only too clearly that he had had no good
fortune with women, or had had disagreeable experiences in his
relations with them.</p>

<p>De Sade, who, perhaps, was not unknown to
<span class="nowrap">Schopenhauer,<a id="FNanchor498"></a><a href="#Footnote498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></span>
was the first advocate of consistent misogyny on principle. It
is an interesting fact, to which I have alluded in an earlier work
(&#8220;Recent Researches regarding the Marquis de Sade,&#8221; p. 433),
that de Sade&#8217;s and Schopenhauer&#8217;s opinions on the physical
characteristics of women are to some extent <b>verbally</b> identical.
While Schopenhauer, in his essay &#8220;On Women&#8221; (&#8220;Works,&#8221;
ed. Grisebach, vol. v., p. 654), speaks of the &#8220;stunted, narrow-shouldered,
wide-hipped and <b>short-legged</b> sex,&#8221; which only a
masculine intellect when <b>clouded by sexual desire</b> could possibly
call &#8220;beautiful,&#8221; we find in the &#8220;Juliette&#8221; (vol. iii., pp. 187,
188) of the Marquis de Sade the following very similar remarks
on the feminine body: &#8220;Take the clothes off one of these
idols of yours! Is it these two <b>short</b> and crooked legs which
have <b>turned your head</b> like this?&#8221; This physical hatefulness of
women corresponds to the mental hatefulness of which de Sade
gives a similar repellent picture (&#8220;Juliette,&#8221; vol iii., pp. 188, 189).
In all his works we find the same fanatical hatred of women.
Sarmiento, in &#8220;Aline et Valcour&#8221; (vol. ii., p. 115), would like to
annihilate all women, and calls that man happy who has learned
to renounce completely intercourse with this &#8220;debased, false,
and noxious sex.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite in the spirit of de Sade, to whom the misogynists of
the Second Empire referred as an authority, Schopenhauer, in
the previously quoted essay &#8220;On Women,&#8221; Strindberg, in the
&#8220;Confessions of a Fool,&#8221; and Weininger, in &#8220;Sex and Character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page485">[485]</span>&#8221;
preached contempt for the feminine
<span class="nowrap">nature;<a id="FNanchor499"></a><a href="#Footnote499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></span> and this seed has
fallen upon fruitful soil in modern youth. Every young blockhead
inflates himself with his &#8220;masculine pride,&#8221; and feels himself
to be the &#8220;knight of the spirit&#8221; in relation to the inferior
sex; every disillusioned and satiated debauchee cultivates (as
a rule, indeed, transiently) the fashion of misogyny, which
strengthens his sentiment of self-esteem. If we wish to speak
at all of &#8220;physiological weak-mindedness,&#8221; let us apply the term
to this disagreeable type of men. As Georg Hirth truly remarks
(&#8220;Ways to Freedom,&#8221; p. 281), such masculine <b>arrogance</b> is merely
a variety of &#8220;mental defect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this misogyny has intruded itself also into
science. The work of P. J.
<span class="nowrap">M&ouml;bius,<a id="FNanchor500"></a><a href="#Footnote500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></span>
notwithstanding the esteem
I feel for the valuable services of the celebrated neurologist in
other departments, can only be termed an aberration, a <i>lapsus</i>
<span class="nowrap"><i>calami</i>.<a id="FNanchor501"></a><a href="#Footnote501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></span>
But he does not stand alone. The admirable work of
Heinrich Schurtz, also, upon &#8220;Age Classes and Associations
of Men&#8221; (Berlin, 1902), is permeated by this misogynist
aura; not less so is the equally stimulating work, &#8220;The Vital Laws
of Civilization&#8221; (Halle, 1904), by Eduard von Mayer. This book,
in association with the equally thoughtful and compendious work
&#8220;The Renascence of Eros Uranios&#8221; (Berlin, 1904), by Benedikt
Friedl&auml;nder, and in conjunction with the efforts of Adolf Brand,
the editor of the homosexual newspaper <i>Der Eigene</i>, and Edwin
Bab (<i>cf.</i> this writer&#8217;s &#8220;The Woman&#8217;s Movement and the Love
of Friends&#8221;; Berlin, 1904), to found a special homosexual group
demanding the &#8220;<b>emancipation of men</b>,&#8221; have been the principal
causes of the belief that the male homosexuals are the true &#8220;repudiators
of woman,&#8221; and that from them has proceeded the increasing
diffusion of modern misogyny. I repeat that this connexion
is true only for the above-named group; that, on the contrary,
genuine misogyny has been taught us by the world&#8217;s
typically heterosexual men, such as Schopenhauer and Strindberg.
Benedikt Friedl&auml;nder and Eduard von Mayer preached,
above all, a &#8220;masculine civilization,&#8221; a deepening of the spiritual
relationships between men; whereas Strindberg and Schopenhauer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page486">[486]</span>
and even Weininger, really leave us in uncertainty as to
what they imagine is to take woman&#8217;s place. All five agree in
this, that the &#8220;intercourse&#8221; of man with woman is to be limited
as much as possible; but only the two first-named openly and
freely advocate homosexual relationships, or at least a &#8220;physiological
friendship&#8221; (B. Friedl&auml;nder), between men. Schopenhauer,
Strindberg, and Weininger did not venture to deduce
these consequences. Yet this is the <b>necessary</b> consequence of
misogyny based on principle.</p>

<p>To the heterosexual men&mdash;and such men form an <b>enormous
majority</b>&mdash;the noble, ideal, asexual friendship of man for man
appears in quite another light from that in which it appears to
the misogynist, to whom it is to serve to <b>replace</b> sexual love,
whereas for heterosexual men friendship for other men is a valuable
treasure <b>additional</b> to the love of woman.</p>

<p>Is there, then, any reason for this contempt and hatred for
woman? Do not the signs increase on all hands to show us that
<b>new</b> relationships are forming between the sexes, that a number
of new points of contact of the spiritual nature are making their
appearance&mdash;in a word, that <b>an entirely new, nobler, most
promising amatory life</b> is developing? I will not fall into the
contrary error to misogyny and inscribe a dithyramb of praise
to feminine nature, as Wedde, Daumer, Quensel, Groddeck, and
others, have done; but I merely indicate the signs of the times
when I say <b>that woman also is awakening</b>! Woman is awakening
to the entirely new existence of a free personality, conscious of her
rights and of her duties. Woman, also, will have her share in
the content and in the tasks of life; she will not enslave us, as
the misogynists clamour, for she wishes to see <b>free men</b> by her
side. What would become of woman if men became slaves?
How could slaves give love?</p>

<p>Life has to-day become a difficult task both for man and for
woman. Man and woman alike must endeavour to perform that
task with confidence in their respective powers; but each, also,
must have confidence in the powers of the other&mdash;a confidence
which becomes <b>palpable</b> in the form of love or friendship, so that
those who feel it have their own powers strengthened.</p>

<p>Not &#8220;Free <b>from</b> woman&#8221; is the watchword of the future,
but &#8220;Free <b>with</b> woman.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p class="noindent">Homosexuality&mdash;<b>love between man and man</b> (uranism), or
<b>between woman and woman</b> (tribadism), a <b>congenital state</b>, or
<b>one spontaneously appearing in very early childhood</b>&mdash;I consider
&#8220;a riddle,&#8221; because, in fact, the more closely in recent years I
have come to know it, the more I have endeavoured to study it
scientifically, the more enigmatical, the more obscure, the more
incomprehensible, it has become to me. But it <b>exists</b>. About
that there is no doubt.</p>

<p>In the years 1905 and 1906 I was occupied almost exclusively
with the problem of homosexuality, and I had the opportunity
of seeing and examining a very large number of genuine homosexual
individuals, both men and women. I was able to observe
them during long periods, both at home and in public life. I
learnt to know them&mdash;their mode of life, their habits, their
opinions, their whole activity, not only in relation to one another,
but also in relation to other non-homosexual individuals and to
persons of the opposite sex. This experience taught me the
indubitable fact that the diffusion of true homosexuality as a
congenital natural phenomenon is <b>far greater</b> than I had earlier
<span class="nowrap">assumed;<a id="FNanchor502"></a><a href="#Footnote502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></span>
so that I find myself now compelled to separate from
true homosexuality the other category of <b>acquired, apparent,
occasional homosexuality</b>, of the existence of which I am now,
as formerly, <b>firmly convinced</b>. I denote this latter by the
term &#8220;<b>pseudo-homosexuality</b>,&#8221; and treat of it in a separate
chapter.</p>

<p>Formerly I believed that true homosexuality was only a
variety of pseudo-homosexuality&mdash;in a sense larval pseudo-homosexuality.
Now, however, I must recognize that true
homosexuality constitutes a <b>special well-defined group</b>, sharply
distinguishable from all forms of pseudo-homosexuality. From
my medical observations, which have been as exact and objective
as possible, I must draw the conclusion that among <b>thoroughly
healthy individuals</b> of both sexes, not to be distinguished from
other normal human beings, there appears <b>in very early childhood</b>,
and certainly not evoked by any kind of external influence,
an <b>inclination</b>, and after puberty a <b>sexual impulse, towards
persons of the same sex</b>; and that this inclination and this impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page490">[490]</span>
are <b>as little to be altered</b> as it is possible to expel from a heterosexual
man the impulse towards woman.</p>

<p>Above all, in this definition of true original homosexuality I
lay the stress upon the word &#8220;<b>healthy</b>&#8221;; for von Krafft-Ebing,
though he admits the existence of congenital homosexuality yet
regards it as a morbid degenerative phenomenon, as the expression
of severe hereditary taint and of a neuro-psychopathic
constitution; and this view is shared by many
<span class="nowrap">alienists.<a id="FNanchor503"></a><a href="#Footnote503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></span> Now,
we must admit that a <b>portion</b> of genuine homosexuals&mdash;just as is
the case with a portion of heterosexual individuals&mdash;possess such
a morbid constitution; and we must acknowledge that yet
<b>another portion</b> exhibit <b>manifestations of nervousness</b> and neurasthenia,
which, beyond doubt, have developed during life
out of an originally healthy state, in consequence of the struggle
for life, the painful experience of being &#8220;different&#8221; from the
great mass of people, etc.; but we ascertain that a <b>third</b>, and, in
fact, the <b>largest, section</b> of original homosexuals are thoroughly
<b>healthy, free from hereditary taint, physically and psychically
normal</b>.</p>

<p>I have observed a great number of homosexuals belonging to
all ages and occupations in whom not the slightest trace of morbidity
was to be detected. They were just as healthy and
normal as are heterosexuals. At an earlier date, though I was
not yet aware of the relatively great frequency of true original
homosexuality, it had become clear to me, on the ground of my
own anthropological theory of sexual anomalies, that homosexuality
might just as well appear in healthy human beings as
in diseased. Therein I have always agreed with Magnus Hirschfeld,
the principal advocate of this view, in opposition to the
theory of the degenerative nature of homosexuality. For me
there is no longer any doubt <b>that homosexuality is compatible
with complete mental and physical health</b>.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to note that von Krafft-Ebing himself
later came to the same view, and thus formally abandoned the
degenerative hypothesis. In his &#8220;New Studies in the Domain
of Homosexuality&#8221; he <span class="nowrap">writes:<a id="FNanchor504"></a><a href="#Footnote504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page491">[491]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In view of the experience that contrary sexuality is a congenital
anomaly, that it represents a disturbance in the evolution of the sexual
life, and of the physical and mental development, in normal relationship
to the kind of reproductive glands which the individual possesses,
<b>it has become impossible to maintain in this connexion the idea of
&#8216;disease.&#8217;</b> Rather, in such a case we must speak of a malformation,
and treat the anomaly as parallel with physical malformation&mdash;for
example, anatomical deviations from the structural type. At the
same time, the assumption of a simultaneous psychopathia is not prejudiced,
for persons who exhibit such an anatomical differentiation
from type (<i>stigmata degenerationis</i>) <b>may remain physically healthy
throughout life, and even be above the average in this respect</b>. Of
course, a difference from the generality so important as contrary sexual
sensation must have a much greater importance to the psyche than
the majority of other anatomical or functional variations. In this
way it is to be explained that a disturbance in the development in the
normal sexual life may often be antagonistic to the development of
a harmonious psychical personality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not infrequently in the case of those with contrary sexuality do
we find neuropathic and psychopathic predispositions, as, for example,
predisposition to constitutional neurasthenia and hysteria, to the
milder forms of periodic psychosis, to the inhibition of the development
of psychical energy (intelligence, moral sense), and in some of
these cases the ethical deficiency (especially when hypersexuality is
associated with the contrary sexuality) may lead to the most severe
aberrations of the sexual impulse. And yet we can always prove that,
relatively speaking, the heterosexual are apt to be much more depraved
than the homosexual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover, other manifestations of degeneration in the sexual
spheres, in the form of sadism, masochism, and fetichism, are relatively
much commoner among the former.</p>

<p>&#8220;That contrary sexual sensation <b>cannot</b> thus be necessarily regarded
as <b>psychical</b> degeneration, or even as a manifestation of disease, is
shown by various considerations, one of the principal of which is
<b>that these variations of the sexual life may actually be associated with
mental superiority</b>.... The proof of this is the existence of men of
all nations whose contrary sexuality is an established fact, and who,
none the less, are the pride of their nation as authors, poets, artists,
leaders of armies, and statesmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;A further proof of the fact that contrary sexual sensation is <b>not
necessarily disease, nor necessarily a vicious self-surrender to the
immoral</b>, is to be found in the fact that all the noble activities of the
heart which can be associated with heterosexual love can equally be
associated with homosexual love... in the form of noble-mindedness,
self-sacrifice, philanthropy, artistic sense, poietic activity, etc., but
also the passions and defects of love (jealousy, suicide, murder, unhappy
love, with its deleterious influence on soul and body, etc.).&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>According to my own investigations and observations, the
<b>relationship between health and disease</b> is among homosexuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page492">[492]</span>
<b>originally identical with that among heterosexuals</b>, and only in
the course of life, in consequence of the social and individual
isolation of the homosexual, which acts on them as a <b>psychical
trauma</b>, is this relationship somewhat altered in favour of the
predominance of disease. Here, however, we have, as a rule,
to do chiefly with <b>acquired</b> nervous troubles and disorders, with
the development of a peculiar type of &#8220;<b>homosexual neurasthenia</b>,&#8221;
and in these cases by superficial observers there may easily be
a confusion between <i>post hoc</i> and <i>propter hoc</i>.</p>

<p>Magnus Hirschfeld, who unquestionably possesses, relatively
and absolutely, the greatest experience in the domain of homosexuality,
<span class="nowrap">maintains<a id="FNanchor505"></a><a href="#Footnote505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></span>
that, according to his material of investigation&mdash;and
this is of gigantic extent&mdash;at least 75&nbsp;% of homosexuals
are born of healthy parents and of happy marriages, often
prolific marriages, and that nervous or mental anomalies, alcoholism,
blood-relationship, and syphilis are no more frequent
among the ancestors of homosexuals than among the ancestors
of those endowed with normal sexuality. Only among from
20 to 25&nbsp;% of homosexuals was he able, in conjunction with
E. Burchard, to find hereditary taint. Only in 16&nbsp;% could they
find well-developed &#8220;stigmata of degeneration&#8221;; and, indeed,
those with stigmata were throughout hereditarily tainted. This
view is supported also by the facts (to which I already alluded
in my &#8220;Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis&#8221;) that homosexuality
is universally diffused in space and time; that it is independent
of civilization, occurs among savage races who are not exposed
to the conditions giving rise to degeneration in the same degree
as civilized races; and that it is prevalent in the country, where
the degenerative influence of life in large towns is not operative.</p>

<p>The most important characteristic of genuine homosexuality,
its <b>spontaneous appearance very early in life</b>, which can only be
referred to natural inheritance, appears to me to be a fact proved
altogether beyond dispute. Men of the highest and most respected
professions&mdash;above all, <b>judges</b>, <b>practising physicians</b>, <b>men
of science</b>, <b>theologians</b>, and <b>scholars</b>&mdash;have described themselves
to me as having been through and through homosexual from
early childhood, so that I am thoroughly convinced that primary
homosexuality makes its appearance at any rate very early in life.</p>

<p>The reports of physicians are of especially great importance.
Hirschfeld (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 12) quotes the utterance of a leading
alienist, himself homosexual: &#8220;I can and must declare that I
have never known a case of homosexuality which I could regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page493">[493]</span>
as other than congenital,&#8221; and the accuracy of this statement
has been confirmed to me personally by several homosexual
physicians. The idea &#8220;congenital&#8221; harmonizes very well with
the demonstrable casual <b>objective</b> cause of the first homosexual
tendencies, which we are able to learn in almost every case of
homosexuality. These can, as is well known, also occur transiently
in heterosexual individuals&mdash;a matter which is discussed
in the chapter &#8220;Pseudo-Homosexuality.&#8221; In the case of genuine
homosexuality, however, these homosexual activities play from
the very beginning a predominant r&ocirc;le, and <b>remain permanent</b>,
because they result from a natural inheritance, from a deeply
rooted impulse. This is shown in the following interesting autobiography
of a man of letters thirty years of age:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;From my earliest childhood there was something girlish in my
whole nature, both outwardly and (more especially) inwardly. I was
very quiet, obedient, diligent, sensitive to praise and blame, rather
bright. I associated chiefly with adults, and was generally beloved.
Sexual activity began in me unusually early. When I was about six
years of age a tutor sat down on my bed, in which I was lying in a
fever. He caressed me, and with his hand <i>membrum meum tetigit</i>.
The voluptuous sensation which resulted was so intense that it has
never disappeared from my memory. At school, where I always
distinguished myself by my application and success, I sometimes
enjoyed mutual &#8216;feeling&#8217; with several other boys. From which side
I inherited the unusual intensity of the sexual impulse I do not know,
but I remember that when I was about twelve years old I already
suffered a good deal from sexual desire, and that it came to me as a
solution of a great difficulty when a comrade instructed me in the
practice of masturbation. It is remarkable that for some time afterwards
there was no evacuation of semen. When this first appeared I
was very much alarmed and disquieted, but I soon became accustomed
to it, and this the more readily because I had no doubt whatever that
all men regularly indulged in the same pleasure. This &#8216;paradisaical&#8217;
state did not, however, last for long; and after a time, when I recognized
the unnatural and dangerous nature of my conduct, I conducted a severe
and unsuccessful contest against my desires. In my life generally I
had a good deal to bear, and I can say that I have hardly preserved
a single really pleasant memory of my past; and yet I could look
back to this past with a certain pride and satisfaction if it had not
been that the sexual side of my life has left such gloomy shadows in
my soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember that from very early days my eyes involuntarily
turned with longing towards elderly vigorous men, but I did not pay
much attention to this fact. I believed that I only practised masturbation
(the influence of which I doubtless exaggerate in memory to
some extent) because it was not possible for me to have sexual intercourse
with women. I was accustomed sometimes to have friendly
association with young girls, who appeared to be extremely attracted
towards me. I always took care, however, that such love tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page494">[494]</span>
were nipped in the bud, because I felt that it was impossible for me
to go any further with them. Ultimately I determined to seek salvation
in intercourse with prostitutes, although they were disagreeable
to my &aelig;sthetic and moral feelings; but I got no help here: either I
was unable to complete the normal sexual act, or in other cases it was
completed without any particular pleasure, and I was always consumed
with anxiety with respect to infection. I had, indeed, often the
opportunity of forming an &#8216;intimacy&#8217; with a woman, but I did not
do it, and always supposed that my failure to do so depended upon
my ridiculous bashfulness and upon the excessive sensitiveness of
my conscience. But though there is some truth in both of these
suggestions, I have not taken into account the principal grounds&mdash;namely,
that I am congenitally homosexual, and that I feel no
physical attraction, or almost none, towards the other sex. This
suffices to explain the fact (which can be explained in no other way)
that when masturbating I almost always represented in imagination
handsome elderly men. In my lascivious dreams, also, such men
play the principal r&ocirc;le. These longings were so powerful that it was
impossible that I should not soon have my attention directed to
them; but as I could not understand them and would not take the
matter seriously (I knew, indeed, that man <b>must</b> feel drawn towards
woman, and not towards man), I continued unceasingly and despairingly
to fight against these fixed ideas, while at the same time with
varying success I endeavoured to cure myself of masturbation; for
in the first place it now gave very little satisfaction, and in the second
place it destroyed my hopes of eventually procreating healthy children.
I had almost come to believe myself no longer competent for
the sexual life when I noticed one day that the view of a <i>membrum
virile</i> set my blood flowing fiercely. I then remembered that this
had sometimes happened before, although to a less marked extent.
I was now compelled to recognize that I was not the same as every
one else. This fact, which I had before suspected, and of which I now
became more and more firmly convinced, reduced me to despair,
which was all the greater because in other ways I felt extremely unhappy,
and because I did not dare to speak of it to any human being.
Sometimes I still thought that there must be some &#8216;misunderstanding,&#8217;
and that there must be some salvation for me. Then it happened
that a simple girl fell in love with me, and I went so far as to enter into
an intimacy with her, although I openly assured her that as far as I
was concerned it was simply a matter of physical enjoyment, and that
I could not in any way make myself responsible for her future, for
which reason care must be taken that there should be no offspring.
During this intimacy, which lasted several months, I sometimes
overcame my enduring inclinations towards men, but completely to
suppress them was impossible. My association with the girl was still
continuing, when one day in a public lavatory I saw an elderly gentleman
whose appearance greatly pleased me. He looked at me tentatively.
Cautiously he leaned over, in order <i>membrum meum
videre</i>; he gradually drew near to me, moved his shaking hand and
... <i>membrum meum tetigit</i>. I was so much surprised and alarmed
that I ran away, and avoided for some time afterwards passing by the
same place. All the stronger, however, was the impulse to find this
remarkable man once more, and this was not at all difficult. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page495">[495]</span>
an enigma such a man seemed to me! How could it happen that he
dared to do that of which I had always been able only to think, to
dream, with heart-quaking and horror? Could there, perhaps, be
another man like this&mdash;perhaps several such exceptional beings?
A short period convinced me that I was not quite alone in my way of
feeling; but this was a weak consolation. Rather, since that time&mdash;that
is to say, during the last five years&mdash;my inward battle has become
more unbearable, for earlier my only battle was to reject homosexual
ideas, and to overcome the habit of solitary self-abuse. Now sometimes
I practise with another mutual onanism (to me the proper
&#8216;natural&#8217; mode of sexual gratification), and yet I cannot forgive
myself for doing it because it is effected in so un&aelig;sthetic a manner,
and is associated with such dangers. Notwithstanding all my endeavours,
however, I have never been able to resist the temptation
for a long time together; and thus I am hunted always by my impulse
as by a wild animal, and can nowhere and in nothing find repose and
forgetfulness. I have frequently changed my place of residence, but
I always before long form new &#8216;relationships.&#8217; The tortures which I
suffer in consequence of the incomparable power of the impulse are
greater them I can possibly express in words. I can only wonder that
I did not lose my reason, and that in the eyes of my friends and
acquaintances I am now, as before, &#8216;the most normal of all human
beings.&#8217; In the senseless and utterly unsuccessful contest with an
impulse which, as far as I am concerned, is wholly, or almost wholly,
congenital, I have lost the best of my powers, although I have long
recognized the fact that this impulse in and by itself is neither morbid
nor sinful, for a divergence from the norm is not a disease, and
the gratification of a natural impulse, which in no respect and for no
human being leads to evil consequences, cannot be regarded as sinful.
Why, then, must I continue to strive against this impulse like a madman?
Because it is very generally misunderstood, so unpardonably
condemned. What help is it that I am now surrounded by love and
respect? I know that so many would turn away from me with horror
if they were to learn my sexual constitution, although it is a matter
which does not concern them at all. Scorn and contempt would then
be my lot. I should be regarded by the majority of human beings as
a libertine; whereas I feel and know that, notwithstanding all the
sensuality of my nature, I have been created for some other purpose
than simply to follow my lustful desire. Who will believe that I
suffer in the struggle with myself? Who will have compassion upon
me? This idea is intolerable. I am condemned to eternal solitude.
I have not the moral right to found a home, to embrace a child who
would give me the name of &#8216;father.&#8217; Is not this punishment sufficiently
severe for God knows what sins? Why, then, should the consciousness
be superadded that I am a pariah, an outcast from society?
Owing to the opinion of society regarding the homosexual&mdash;an opinion
based upon ignorance, stupidity, and ill-nature&mdash;society drives these
unhappy beings to death (or to a marriage which in their case is
criminal), and then triumphantly exclaims: &#8216;Look what degenerate
beings they are!&#8217; No, they are not degenerates, those whose lives
you have made unbearable; they are for the most part spiritually and
morally very healthy human beings. I will speak of myself. Why
do I long for death? Certainly not because I am mentally abnormal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page496">[496]</span>
I am no morbid pessimist, and I know well enough that life can be
very beautiful. But, unfortunately, it cannot be so for me; for my
life is a hell; I am intolerably weary of my internal conflict; it has
become horribly difficult to me to play the hypocrite, to pretend continually
to be a happy man rejoicing in life; I am bending beneath the
burden of my heavy iron mask. Recently I had myself hypnotized,
in order to have my thoughts turned away as far as possible from
sexual matters. My hypnotist said to me: &#8216;You see, you will be at
rest now,&#8217; and involuntarily in sleep I had to swallow these words,
&#8216;Be at rest&#8217;! Good God, is that possible? Does the &#8216;normal&#8217; man
know how this word sounds in our ears? Who will understand my
intolerable pain? Perhaps my dear parents could have done so, as
they loved me above all, as if they had a presentiment that I should
be the most unhappy of their children; but they have been dead for
several years, and so, notwithstanding my numerous relatives and
friends, I stand quite alone in this world, and vainly seek an answer to
the questions &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;Wherefore?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Genuine homosexuality exhibits, like heterosexuality, the
character of an impulse arising from the <b>very nature</b> of the personality,
which, in activity from the cradle to the grave, expresses
the <b>continuity of the individual</b> in respect also of this peculiar
sexual tendency. Thus there does not exist a homosexuality
<b>limited</b> merely to a certain age of life, as to childhood or youth,
to maturity, or even to old age. Hence we must distinguish from
genuine homosexuality the p&aelig;derasty of old men described by
Schopenhauer, which does not begin till old age appears. We
must distinguish, also, the love of Greek boys for elderly men;
these must be included in the category of <b>pseudo-homosexuality</b>.
An inclination which, like original homosexuality, is an <b>outflow
of the essential nature</b> of the individual concerned, cannot disappear
so long as the individual himself persists, cannot begin
or end except with the beginning or end of his life. Homosexuality
extends throughout the lifetime, and if by any cause
whatever&mdash;for example, enforced marriage&mdash;it is apparently
temporarily suppressed, it always reappears. It seems very
doubtful if there really exists, as von
<span class="nowrap">Krafft-Ebing<a id="FNanchor506"></a><a href="#Footnote506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></span> assumes,
a genuine <b>retarded</b> homosexuality&mdash;that is, original homosexuality
which does not manifest itself until a comparatively advanced
age. There do, doubtless, exist transient cases of pseudo-homosexuality,
which have in some cases developed in those
previously heterosexual, and which in other cases are superimposed
upon a bisexual basis. These belong to the category of
&#8220;<b>acquired</b>&#8221; homosexuality, which is always a pseudo-homosexuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page497">[497]</span></p>

<p>The course of life of genuine homosexuals is a complete expression
of the results of simple inversion of the sexual impulse, and the
homosexual type makes its appearance in childhood. The fact of
the &#8220;<b>difference</b>&#8221; between the homosexual and others is not experienced
merely by the person himself, but is also noticed <b>very early</b>
by those who have care of him. The &#8220;girlish&#8221; (in the case of
female homosexuality, &#8220;boyish&#8221;) and &#8220;peculiar&#8221; nature is
often observed by members of the family, by comrades, and by
tutors, and gives rise to the use of nicknames. These manifestations
and perceptions are a valuable objective confirmation of
the subjective sensations of homosexual children. A Protestant
clergyman whose homosexual son also studied theology remarked
to M. Hirschfeld: &#8220;He was from the very beginning different
from my five other sons.&#8221; The physical and moral peculiarities
presently to be described are often manifested in very early
childhood. Hirschfeld has frequently been able to diagnose
&#8220;homosexuality&#8221; in children from ten to fourteen years of age.
He alludes, among others, to a very timid boy, twelve years of
age, who suffered from migraine, who cried frequently, who kept
himself apart from his schoolfellows, and corresponded daily with
a boy friend. He was fond of flowers and music; he had very
little inclination to mathematics (according to Hirschfeld, a
somewhat characteristic phenomenon in cases of homosexuality).
The examination of the boy, who was extremely bashful, showed
that <b>the genital organs were still completely undeveloped</b>, the
penis resembling that of a boy of four years, whilst the breasts
were markedly developed like those of a girl at the commencement
of puberty.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the fondness on the part of boys for girls&#8217;
games, or on the part of girls for boys&#8217; games, can be regarded
as a symptom of diagnostic importance in regard to the existence
of homosexuality, for a fondness for playing with girls and for
cooking may often be observed in boys who later prove thoroughly
heterosexual. Still, these things do play a great part in the
autobiography of homosexuals, and have, in fact, great importance
in cases in which these tendencies persist <b>after</b> puberty,
when the heterosexually differentiated psyche would, after the
transitory episode of these youthful games, display activities now
corresponding to the fully developed sexual sensibility.</p>

<p>Puberty is the most important period with regard to the final
<b>determination</b> of homosexuality by means of particular <b>physical</b>
and <b>mental</b> characteristics.</p>

<p>The consideration of the physical and mental characters of male<span class="pagenum" id="Page498">[498]</span>
homosexuals leads clearly to the distinction of two different types&mdash;the
<b>effeminate</b> and the <b>virile</b> urnings. With regard to the
relative numbers of these two types there exist no definite data.
Hirschfeld, in his &#8220;Urnings,&#8221; describes chiefly the type of the
more or less effeminate urnings&mdash;that is, of those who show the
greatest resemblance to the feminine nature&mdash;and does not
express an opinion as to whether the number of effeminate homosexuals
is greater than the number of virile homosexuals&mdash;that
is, of those whose nature is predominantly masculine. Another
experienced observer of urnings, Dr. J. E.
<span class="nowrap">Meisner,<a id="FNanchor507"></a><a href="#Footnote507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></span> is of opinion
that in the <b>majority</b> of cases the male type of homosexuals is
encountered rather than the female. According to my own
observations, it appears to me that the number of virile and of
effeminate urnings is about
<span class="nowrap">identical.<a id="FNanchor508"></a><a href="#Footnote508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></span> There are certainly
numerous virile homosexuals, or rather homosexuals of a
thoroughly <b>masculine</b> build of body, without great deviations
from the normal type, who yet have a more or less feminine mode
of sensibility. The distinction between effeminate and virile
homosexuals would appear therefore to be only relative, and for
the majority of cases Hirschfeld&#8217;s remarks (&#8220;Urnings,&#8221; p. 86)
apply:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;A homosexual who was not distinguishable physically and mentally
from the complete man is a being I have not yet encountered among
fifteen hundred cases, and I am therefore unable to believe in the
existence of such until I personally encounter one.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>More especially after removing any beard or moustache that may
be present, we sometimes see much more clearly the feminine
expression of face in a male homosexual, whilst before the hair
was removed they appeared quite man-like. Still more important
for the determination of a feminine habitus are direct physical
characteristics. Among these there must be mentioned a <b>considerable
deposit of fat</b>, by which the resemblance to the feminine
type is produced, the contours of the body being more rounded
than in the case of the normal male. In correspondence with
this the <b>muscular system</b> is less powerfully developed than it is
in heterosexual men, the skin is delicate and soft, and the complexion<span class="pagenum" id="Page499">[499]</span>
is much clearer than is usual in men. Last winter I
attended an urnings&#8217; ball, and I was much impressed, when
looking at the <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> men, with the remarkable whiteness of
their skin on the shoulders, neck, and back&mdash;also in those who
had not applied powder&mdash;and by the fact that the little acne
spots almost always present in normal men were absent in these.
The peculiar rounding of the shoulders was also remarkable,
from its resemblance to what one sees in women.</p>

<p>According to Hirschfeld, the skin of the urning almost always
feels warmer than his environment. He refers the expression
commonly used among the people (in Germany), &#8220;warm brothers,&#8221;
to this circumstance, and derives the Latin <i>homo mollis</i> (&#8220;soft
man&#8221;) from the softness of the skin and of the muscular system
(though in my opinion this term is applied rather to the <b>entire</b>
effeminate, soft nature of the urning). Of great interest is the
relation <b>between the breadth of the shoulders and the width of
the pelvis</b> in homosexual men. Whilst the breadth of the
shoulders of heterosexual men is several centimetres in excess of
the width of the pelvis, and in women the width of the pelvis is
greater than the breadth of the shoulders, according to Hirschfeld
in the urning there is little or no difference between these
two measurements. This, in respect of the bodily structure,
would completely justify the expression &#8220;intermediate stage,&#8221;
and would give the homosexual man a position between the
heterosexual man and the heterosexual woman. Still, there
are, without doubt, numerous virile homosexual men in whom
this great width of the pelvis is not present. Investigations regarding
the corresponding relationships among homosexual
women have not to my knowledge hitherto been made. Very
striking is the <b>often luxuriant growth of hair</b>, especially in
the effeminate types, whereas the virile homosexuals are in this
respect more approximate to normal men, baldness being common
among them.</p>

<p>Our attention having been recently directed by the investigation
of H. Swoboda to the existence of <b>equivalents of menstruation</b>
in men, the occurrence of such equivalents among urnings
is of interest. Hirschfeld reports the case of an effeminate
homosexual who since the age of fourteen had suffered at intervals
of twenty-eight days from migraine, associated with severe pains
in the back and loins, so that his stepmother said to him: &#8220;It
is with you just as it is with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <b>gait</b> and the <b>movements</b> of effeminate urnings also have a
somewhat womanly appearance, and attract the attention even of<span class="pagenum" id="Page500">[500]</span>
one who is not in the secret. Short, tripping paces and elegant
movements are characteristic of the effeminate.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter we came to the conclusion that the fully
adult normal woman was approximate in physical characteristics
rather to the child and to the youthful human being than to the
adult man; and in this connexion it is of interest that we must
describe as a distinctively <b>feminine</b> characteristic the peculiarity
of many male homosexuals, which enables them <b>for a long time
to preserve a youthful appearance and demeanour</b>.</p>

<p>Very remarkable is the behaviour of the voice. The change
in the voice may not occur at all, or does not occur till very late.
The capacity for singing soprano or falsetto is also long preserved.
Others, in whom the change of voice had failed to
occur, were able to lower the pitch considerably by practice.
A typical and well-known example is that of the baritone singer
Willibald von Sadler-Gr&uuml;n, whom I had the opportunity of
hearing recently, when, under the name of &#8220;Urany Verde,&#8221;
he made a professional journey through Germany, and sang
his songs dressed as a woman. He said of himself: &#8220;My voice
has never cracked in a definite way. At twenty-three years of
age I could sing soprano, and can still do so to-day, at the age
of thirty. The deeper tones for speech and singing I acquired
only by instruction and practice&#8221; (Hirschfeld, &#8220;Urnings,&#8221;
p. 65). In this typical effeminate, the breasts also had a completely
feminine character, as, according to Hirschfeld, is by no
means rare in boy urnings, who at puberty experience swelling
of the breasts, associated with painful
<span class="nowrap">sensations.<a id="FNanchor509"></a><a href="#Footnote509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></span> I must,
however, maintain, in opposition to Hirschfeld, that abnormally
marked development of the breasts is by no means rare in perfectly
normal heterosexual men. For the diagnosis of homosexuality,
the imperfect development of the larynx, and the failure
of the voice to crack, are more important than the marked development
of the breasts. I remember distinctly that in the case
of a fellow-student of mine years ago his high voice used greatly
to strike me. To-day I am able to understand how this fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page501">[501]</span>
was associated with his complete disinclination to sexual intercourse
with women and his insensibility to feminine charms in
general; and I am able in his case to diagnose homosexuality
with absolute certainty.</p>

<p>In the case of <b>virile</b> homosexuals, all the above-mentioned
physical peculiarities are far less noticeable. In their outward
appearance they much more nearly resemble heterosexual men,
but still they always have <b>comparatively</b> more of the feminine in
their nature than the latter. Such a typically virile homosexual,
in whose appearance the impression of femininity was entirely
absent, I was able recently to recognize during a railway journey,
in the course of which he confided to me misogynous opinions
against other fellow-travellers, and also said that in the whole
of his life&mdash;he was a man of a little over thirty&mdash;he had not had
intercourse with women more than three or four times. During
the long wait of the train at a station I took the opportunity,
having mentioned that I was a physician by profession, to ask
him if he was not homosexual, a fact which he at once admitted.
Already in very early childhood he had felt himself distinctly
drawn only towards masculine beings, and had <b>never</b> experienced
the least inclination towards women. In this case also any
kind of outward influence was excluded, because he had grown
up at home and chiefly in a <b>feminine</b> environment. As I have
already said, in appearance he was masculine, and he himself
stated that he had no physical characteristics which suggested
a feminine impression. That this is the case in numerous virile
homosexuals is proved by the distinctive fact that many of them
are <b>professional soldiers</b>, especially officers, in respect of whose
appearance virility is very strongly insisted on.</p>

<p>The <b>mental</b> qualities of male homosexuals correspond fully to
the physical, and occupy a middle region between the psyche of
the heterosexual man and that of woman. But every <b>emotional
element</b> is in them more prominent than energetic will-power
and clear-sighted reason. Something soft and pliable is characteristic
of the majority of urnings. This adaptability manifests
itself in good-humouredness, in inclination to self-sacrifice, but,
above all, in a most astonishing <b>mobility of the imaginative life</b>,
which seems to be something characteristic of the homosexual,
and to explain his frequent artistic capacity, above all his
talents for <b>music</b>, for which vocation, indeed, his less fixed and
more sketchy nature especially fits him, but also for poetry,
painting, acting, and sculpture. &#8220;For all the fine arts,&#8221; says
Hirschfeld, &#8220;from cooking and artistic needlework to sculpture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page502">[502]</span>
we find that urnings have exceptional talent.&#8221; The inclination
to intellectual occupation is distinctly greater among homosexuals
than the inclination to bodily work. Associated with this is the
ambition to distinguish themselves mentally above those by whom
they are surrounded. Hirschfeld&#8217;s assertion that homosexuals
belonging to the lower classes exhibit intellectual predominance
over their environment, I am able emphatically to confirm, after
frequent conversations with homosexual workmen and menservants.
The peculiarity of their congenital tendencies has here
early given rise to a certain intellectual profundity, has early
taught these men to <b>reflect</b> about the world and about human
existence. Every homosexual is a philosopher for himself.
Most heterosexuals, especially those of the lower classes, never
arrive at thinking so much about themselves and about their
relations to the external world, as is a matter of course among
homosexuals. The <b>imaginative</b>, the <b>dreamy</b>, is much more
predominant in the homosexual than a crude sense of reality.
This expresses itself particularly in his love, which far less
frequently and exclusively than among the heterosexual takes
the form of a gross and material sensuality. On the contrary,
it permits us to recognize the inward need for tenderness and
delicacy, for a peculiar ideal colouring. Goethe has contrasted
this latter with the more sensual heterosexual love; he speaks
of the</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;remarkable phenomenon of the love of men for each other. Let it
be admitted that this love is seldom pushed to the highest degree
of sensuality, but rather occupies the intermediate region between
inclination and passion. I am able to say that I have seen with my
own eyes the most beautiful manifestations of this love, such as we
have handed down to us from the days of Greek antiquity; and as
an observant student of human nature I was able to observe the
intellectual and moral elements of this
<span class="nowrap">love.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor510"></a><a href="#Footnote510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The ideal conception of Platonic&mdash;that is, of homosexual&mdash;love
was a non-sensual, assexual love. The psychical element also
plays an important part in modern uranism&mdash;a part overlooked
or underestimated, whereas the sensual side is exaggerated.</p>

<p>Homosexuality as an anthropological phenomenon is diffused
throughout all classes of the population. We find it among
workmen just as much as among aristocrats, princely personalities,
and intellectual heroes. Physicians, lawyers, theologians,
philosophers, merchants, artists, etc., all contribute their contingents
to uranism. If the extraordinarily frequent occurrence<span class="pagenum" id="Page503">[503]</span>
of homosexuality in the highest classes of society, especially
in the leaders of the aristocracy, may possibly be brought into
relationship with the processes of &#8220;degeneration,&#8221; still, on the
other hand, numerous homosexuals are derived from healthy
families, such as have not transmitted hereditary taint through
a long series of ancestors. Recently G.
<span class="nowrap">Merzbach<a id="FNanchor511"></a><a href="#Footnote511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></span> has studied
the relationship between homosexuality and the choice of a profession,
and has proved that this choice is usually a consequence
of the natural tendency. Thus we find an especially large number
of homosexuals engaged in the production of ready-made
clothing and in other manufacturing trades; others become music-hall
comedians playing women&#8217;s parts, actors, dancers. Actors
and singers appearing on the stage as women are to a large extent
original <span class="nowrap">homosexuals.<a id="FNanchor512"></a><a href="#Footnote512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></span>
Among hairdressers and waiters we find
also a relatively large number of urnings.</p>

<p>As regards the <b>diffusion</b> of homosexuality, the data obtainable
up to the most recent times have been extremely contradictory.
The first exact information is to be found in the work of a physician,
published under the name of M.
<span class="nowrap">Kertbeny,<a id="FNanchor513"></a><a href="#Footnote513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></span> on &#8220;&sect; 143 of
the Prussian Criminal Code of April 14, 1851, and its Continuance
as &sect; 152 in the Proposal for a Criminal Code for the North
German Bund&#8221; (Leipzig, 1869). The author enumerates in
Berlin 10,000 homosexuals among 700,000 inhabitants (equal to
1&middot;425&nbsp;%). A patient of von Krafft-Ebing, living in a town of
13,000 inhabitants, was acquainted with 14 urnings; and in
another town of 60,000 he knew of at least 80. Many other equally
uncertain estimates are recorded by Magnus Hirschfeld. They
vary between 2&nbsp;% and 0&middot;1&nbsp;%&mdash;vary, that is to say, within very
wide limits. In view, therefore, of the importance of the exact
determination of the number of homosexuals, which I myself
had earlier declared to be desirable, we owe great thanks to
Magnus Hirschfeld for having made an
<span class="nowrap">attempt<a id="FNanchor514"></a><a href="#Footnote514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></span> to obtain some
exact data regarding this matter. He deduces from a compilation
of thirty test investigations (reports regarding homosexuals in
various classes of the population), and by means of an inquiry
made with sealed letters, that the proportion of male homosexuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page504">[504]</span>
to the population <b>is about</b> 1&middot;5&nbsp;%. That is a very much <b>greater</b>
percentage than has hitherto been assumed to exist. Formerly I
doubted the accuracy of this figure, but since numerous respected,
honourable, well-behaved persons, of whom I had not suspected
it, have assured me that they have been homosexual since childhood,
I have no longer any doubt regarding the approximate
accuracy of Hirschfeld&#8217;s statistics. The enquiry made by
Dr. von R&ouml;mer in Amsterdam gave similar results, for he
found the proportion of homosexuals to be 1&middot;9&nbsp;%. A third
enquiry made by Hirschfeld among the metal-workers of Berlin
gave a proportion of 1&middot;1&nbsp;%.</p>

<p><b>Normal heterosexual</b> love was reported in about 94 to 96&nbsp;% of
the three inquiries.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;An imposing recognition of the love of man for woman, a powerful
manifestation of the provision for the preservation of the species, and
a contradiction to the fear that the uranian element in the population
could ever seriously impair the well-being of the great majority&#8221;
(Hirschfeld).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>As &#8220;<b>bisexual</b>&#8221;&mdash;that is, as exhibiting tendencies towards both
sexes&mdash;the average of the three enquiries reported 3&middot;9&nbsp;%, of whom,
however, 0&middot;8&nbsp;% were mainly homosexual.</p>

<p>The total number of the purely and mainly homosexual was
thus 2&middot;2&nbsp;%. Hence, according to the results of the last census of
1900, in the total population of the German Empire, numbering
56,367,178, there would be about 1,200,000 <b>homosexuals</b>; whilst
of the population of Berlin, numbering 2,500,000, 56,000 would
be homosexual.</p>

<p>In the interest of the scientific and social study of homosexuality,
it is urgently necessary that these statistical investigations
should be pursued, for if it should appear that the above estimates
really apply to the whole Empire&mdash;which I do not feel justified in
assuming without further evidence, since it is naturally possible
that Berlin might contain a relatively greater number of homosexuals&mdash;uranism
would, in fact, have a greater social importance
than it has hitherto been assumed to possess. In any case, the
number of urnings is large enough to make them appear a
remarkable anthropological variety of our race.</p>

<p>The truth of this assertion is supported by the fact of the
ubiquitous diffusion of uranism in time and space. In addition
to homosexuality as a popular custom, genuine homosexuality
also played a part in antiquity; and F.
<span class="nowrap">Karsch<a id="FNanchor515"></a><a href="#Footnote515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></span>
has proved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page505">[505]</span>
an admirable book its occurrence among all savage races, although
unquestionably numerous cases of non-genuine homosexuality
must have been included. That homosexuality is in no way a
sign of &#8220;degeneration&#8221; is proved also by the fact that it is more
widely diffused among the still thoroughly vigorous Germans and
Anglo-Saxons than it is among the Latin peoples. It is especially
frequent in the German Ostsee provinces. It existed among the
ancient <span class="nowrap">Scandinavians.<a id="FNanchor516"></a><a href="#Footnote516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></span>
Recently F. Karsch has announced the
publication of ethnological researches on homosexuality, the
first volume of which has already been issued, under the title
&#8220;Homosexual Life among the Inhabitants of Eastern Asia: the
Chinese, the Japanese, and the
<span class="nowrap">Koreans&#8221;<a id="FNanchor517"></a><a href="#Footnote517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></span> (Munich, 1906). In
the preface he states expressly that he treats not only of original
homosexuality, but also of artificially produced or acquired
homosexuality&mdash;that which I call &#8220;pseudo-homosexuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>My earlier view, that true homosexuality is rare among the
<b>Jews</b>, I find it necessary to revise, for recently I have made the
acquaintance of numerous Jewish homosexuals.</p>

<p>For the <b>earlier history and literature of homosexuality</b> the
most important, and, in fact, nearly exhaustive, sources are
the article &#8220;P&aelig;derasty,&#8221; by Meier, in Ersch and Gruber&#8217;s
&#8220;General Encyclop&aelig;dia,&#8221; section iii., part 9, pp. 149-189 (Leipzig,
1837); Rosenbaum&#8217;s &#8220;History of Syphilis in Antiquity,&#8221; pp.
<span class="nowrap">119-227<a id="FNanchor518"></a><a href="#Footnote518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span>
(Halle, 1893); and, finally, the writings of the earliest
German student of homosexuality, containing numerous interesting
data, the Hanoverian official Karl Heinrich
<span class="nowrap">Ulrichs,<a id="FNanchor519"></a><a href="#Footnote519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></span>
who, under the pseudonym &#8220;Numa Numantius,&#8221; published
numerous works devoted to the emancipation of homosexuals,
and to the proof of the congenital nature of homosexuality.
The general title of these works is &#8220;Anthropological Studies on
the Sexual Love of Man for Man.&#8221; They were published under
various peculiar separate titles, such as: &#8220;Vindex&#8221; (Leipzig,
1864); &#8220;Inclusa&#8221; (Leipzig, 1864); &#8220;Vindicta&#8221; (Leipzig, 1865);<span class="pagenum" id="Page506">[506]</span>
&#8220;Formatrix&#8221; (Leipzig, 1865); &#8220;Ara Spei&#8221; (Leipzig, 1865);
&#8220;Gladius Furens&#8221; (Kassel, 1868); &#8220;Memnon&#8221; (Schleiz, 1868);
&#8220;Incubus&#8221; (Leipzig, 1869); &#8220;Argonauticus&#8221; (Leipzig, 1869);
&#8220;Araxes&#8221; (Schleiz, 1870); &#8220;Uranus&#8221; (Leipzig, 1870); &#8220;Kritische
Pfeile&#8221; (Stuttgart, 1879). In addition, Ulrichs, whose lifetime
extended from 1825 to 1895, published uranian poetry under the
title of &#8220;Auf Bienchens Fl&uuml;geln&#8221; (&#8220;On the Wings of the Bee&#8221;);
Leipzig, 1875. These writings, most of which are very rare in
their original editions (although many were reprinted in the
year 1898), contained a number of new points of view for the
consideration of homosexuality, which have been recognized as
sound by recent investigators.</p>

<p>Important contributions to the knowledge of homosexuality
are afforded us by the studies of the life and works of celebrated
and intellectually distinguished urnings. As unquestionably
homosexual we may mention the poet
<span class="nowrap">Platen,<a id="FNanchor520"></a><a href="#Footnote520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></span>

Duquesnoy <span class="nowrap">(1602-1654).<a id="FNanchor531"></a><a href="#Footnote531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></span>
The following celebrated persons
have also been regarded as urnings, but, as it appears to me, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page507">[507]</span>
insufficient proofs: Frederick the Great; J. J. Winkelmann, who
at most was bisexual, since we know of passionate letters written
by him to a woman; and Alexander von
<span class="nowrap">Sternberg,<a id="FNanchor532"></a><a href="#Footnote532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></span> of whom
the same is true; the reformers
<span class="nowrap">Beza<a id="FNanchor533"></a><a href="#Footnote533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></span>
and <span class="nowrap">Calvin,<a id="FNanchor534"></a><a href="#Footnote534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></span> who have
unquestionably been wrongfully accused; and finally Byron and
<span class="nowrap">Grillparzer,<a id="FNanchor535"></a><a href="#Footnote535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></span>
without troubling to enumerate hypotheses utterly
without foundation. It is unquestionably a fact that a large
number of intellectually prominent men were genuine homosexuals,
and that their abnormal congenital tendencies did not
prevent their doing important work in other spheres of activity.
But this happened <b>notwithstanding</b>, and <b>not</b>, as many talented
apologists wish to prove, <b>because of</b> their uranism.</p>

<p>When we pass to consider the <b>activity</b> of homosexual love, we
find that homosexuals may, and actually do, love either other
homosexual or heterosexual individuals. According to the
account given by Meisner (&#8220;Uranism,&#8221; pp. 19, 20), the amatory
ideal of most homosexual men is a heterosexual man, and intercourse
between two urnings is, properly speaking, only a matter
of necessity. But by several homosexuals with whom I discussed
the matter this view was declared to be erroneous; in
the majority of cases the attraction between two homosexuals
plays the principal r&ocirc;le. Ulrichs endeavoured to provide a
theoretical justification for the sexual relationship between two
homosexuals, and maintained (<i>cf.</i>, for example, &#8220;Inclusa,&#8221;
pp. 64, 65) that Nature destined the heterosexual, or &#8220;dioning,&#8221;
as he calls them, by no means for woman alone, but also for the
urning, for the &#8220;fulfilment of the sexual purposes of Nature,
not directed towards reproduction.&#8221; According to Hirschfeld
(&#8220;Urnings,&#8221; pp. 22, 23), it is unquestionable that, whilst many
homosexuals greatly prefer to associate with those who also feel
in a uranian manner, and whilst to many also it is a matter of
indifference whether or not those with whom they have sexual
relations are themselves endowed with contrary sexuality, quite
a number of urnings feel attracted <b>exclusively</b> to normal, sexually
powerful natures. As a rule, it is not difficult for homosexuals
to gratify their inclinations in intercourse with heterosexual
individuals. A middle-aged urning informed me that young<span class="pagenum" id="Page508">[508]</span>
heterosexual men <b>almost always</b> acceded in this matter to the
expressed wish of homosexuals&mdash;in the first place from simple
curiosity, and in the second place by no means rarely from
sexual excitement. Indeed, according to this authority, effeminate
homosexual men often produce in powerfully sensual
heterosexual men the impression of femininity, and are seduced
by the latter to mutual masturbation, especially in a state of
alcoholic intoxication. Not infrequently does it happen&mdash;a
striking example having come to my knowledge&mdash;that a young
heterosexual has a love intimacy with a girl, and yet occasionally,
when he is for any reason unable to have sexual intercourse with
her, he <b>very willingly</b> transfers his affections to a homosexual
man. Male prostitutes are also, to a large extent, heterosexual
men who give themselves to homosexuals for pecuniary reward.
Occasionally, moreover, heterosexual men mistake very effeminate
urnings going about in women&#8217;s clothing for genuine women,
and have intercourse with them in this belief&mdash;a belief which
these latter are clever enough to keep up until the last possible
moment.</p>

<p>Passing now to the consideration of the special circumstances
of sexual attraction, we find that the true love of
<span class="nowrap">boys,<a id="FNanchor536"></a><a href="#Footnote536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></span> or rather
the love of children (<b>p&aelig;dophilia</b>), is rare in homosexuals. The
age chiefly preferred is that between seventeen and twenty-five
years, alike by mature homosexual men and by old men. On the
other hand, it <b>is by no means an exceptional phenomenon</b> for
youths, or even mature men, to feel attracted exclusively by
elderly men (the so-called &#8220;<b>gerontophilia</b>&#8221;). There exists also
a heterosexual &#8220;gerontophilia&#8221;&mdash;that is to say, abnormal love
exhibited by young men for old women, or by young women for
old men. Thus F&eacute;r&eacute; reports (&#8220;Note sur une Anomalie de l&#8217;Instinct
Sexuel: Gerontophilie,&#8221; published in the <i>Journal de Neurologie</i>,
1905) the case of a man twenty-seven years of age who was
sexually attracted only by white-haired, elderly women. He
referred this to an impression received in very early youth. When
four years old he slept in the same bed with an elderly lady, a
family friend, who was visiting the house, and he then for the
first time experienced sexual excitement. He had a dislike to
young girls and young married women. A white-haired elderly
woman whom he loved dyed her hair light brown, whereupon he
ceased to care for her. Further, effeminate urnings prefer virile
homosexuals; whereas many of these latter have a great dislike<span class="pagenum" id="Page509">[509]</span>
to effeminates and to men in women&#8217;s clothing&mdash;to those male
&#8220;women&#8221; who adopt by preference feminine nicknames, such
as Louisa instead of Louis, Georgina instead of George, and who
speak to one another as &#8220;sister,&#8221; just as the Roman Emperor
Heliogabalus wished to be addressed as &#8220;mistress&#8221; instead of
&#8220;lord.&#8221; Many urnings love beardless men; others love men
with a moustache or a full beard; many homosexuals are fascinated
by bright-coloured cloth, just as women are. Moreover,
every possible individual detail may here have an attractive
force, just as is the case with heterosexual love (the hair, the
stature, the gait, the eyes, the intelligence, and the character).</p>

<p>Ideal love and the gratification of the grossest sensuality are
also the two poles between which the <b>amatory manifestations</b>
of male homosexuals oscillate. Many confine themselves to
simple contacts, caresses, kisses and embraces. Most frequently
sexual gratification is obtained by mutual masturbation. The
idea that the non-homosexual especially associates with the
word &#8220;p&aelig;derasty&#8221; is
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;p&aelig;dication&#8221;<a id="FNanchor537"></a><a href="#Footnote537"
class="fnanchor">[537]</a></span>&mdash;that is, <i>immissio membri
in anum</i>. This sexual act is, however, far less frequent than it
is commonly assumed to be by heterosexuals. According to
Magnus Hirschfeld, it occurs only in 8&nbsp;%, according to G. Merzbach
only in 6&nbsp;%, of all cases of intercourse between male homosexuals.
In an essay on p&aelig;dication which I possess, written
by a homosexual, it is represented as much commoner, and as
&#8220;the most natural and least harmful means of gratification.&#8221;
According to a verbal communication made to me, the author
of this essay knew of one hundred cases of p&aelig;dication in which no
harm had resulted. Frequently <i>coitus inter femora</i> takes the
place of p&aelig;dication; still more frequently &#8220;fellation,&#8221; or <i>coitus
in os</i>, and the widely diffused &#8220;tongue
<span class="nowrap">kiss.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor538"></a><a href="#Footnote538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></span> Other perverse
manifestations of the homosexual impulse also occur, such as
anilinctus, fetichism, masochism, sadism, exhibitionism, etc., just
as they occur in heterosexual individuals.</p>

<p>With regard to the relations of true homosexuals to women,
generally speaking they <b>loathe sexual intercourse</b> with woman,
but they do not dislike woman herself. Women, on the contrary,
are greatly liked by most homosexuals; effeminate urnings more
especially gladly seek their society, in order to gossip with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page510">[510]</span>
about all kinds of feminine belongings. <b>Marriages</b> are often
contracted by homosexuals who are really ignorant as to their
own condition, or who hope to conceal it from the world, or
simply for pecuniary considerations. They result most unhappily
if the wife has need of love, and understands the real
nature of the case; or, again, if she becomes jealous of her husband&#8217;s
male lovers; but when the wife is frigid, they may turn
out quite happily. They are, however, always very unnatural.
<span class="nowrap">Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor539"></a><a href="#Footnote539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></span>
has thoroughly discussed the question of the marriage
of homosexuals, and has also alluded to the occasional marriages
between homosexual men and homosexual women. The fact
proved by him that among homosexuals the impulse towards
the preservation of the species is almost entirely wanting&mdash;not
more than 3&nbsp;% have the wish to possess children&mdash;shows how
little fitted they are for the purposes of marriage.</p>

<p>The above-described sexual relationships may be illustrated
by a few original reports taken from the autobiographies of
homosexuals. For example, a homosexual man, twenty-seven
years of age, writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;When I was young, from four to six years of age, I loved to look
at the male generative organs, without knowing why they attracted me.
I liked to look at sculpture and pictures representing male nudity. I
detest woman&#8217;s work and the fashions of the day: a simple costume
suffices for me. I learned the &#8216;great secret of the world&#8217; when I was
twelve years old, but woman had no interest for me, and I was always
asking little boys of from ten to fourteen years of age to show me their
private parts. I commenced to have carnal intercourse with boys
(aged eighteen to twenty-four) when I was myself twenty-four. Only
<i>coitus inter femora</i>, face to face, never from behind. I always assume
the active r&ocirc;le. A young man from eighteen to twenty-four years of
age is to me like a woman. A woman is to me a thing (!), not so a
man. Perhaps it is original, odd for our time; but what is to be done?
Woman is a machine for producing children, and nothing more. I am
not married, and never shall marry.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Another homosexual writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I was about five years old when, walking with a nursemaid in the
pleasure gardens, I saw a man masturbating. Although I did not
know what he was doing, the picture busied my imagination for
many years. In my dreams, up to the age of fourteen years, the
thought of living together with a companion of the same age as
myself played the principal part. At the age of thirteen I fell in love
with a schoolfellow, who was, however, but little inclined towards me.
What perhaps especially interested me in him was that he brought
sexual enlightenment to our class. Through moving to another town<span class="pagenum" id="Page511">[511]</span>
I lost sight of him. Although at that time I knew nothing of the
real sexual life, still I sought for objects which excited my sensuality.</p>

<p>&#8220;An unknown man of about thirty-five years of age seduced me,
and practised p&aelig;derasty with me on the first occasion that he met me.
I felt that there was something altogether wrong about this practice,
but was too weak to withdraw myself from his influence. After
about three months he disappeared. Now also I knew what masturbation
was, for in the school this practice was common.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the age of eighteen I left the school, and as in my comrades
the impulse towards women now showed itself, I, for my part, felt all
the more how everything directed me towards man. I often endeavoured,
in obedience to the urging of my friends, to form relationships
with women of the half-world, but this always filled me with the
greatest horror and repugnance. To me it is a dreadful feeling when
I notice that a woman is interested in me. All the more, on the other
hand, did the male sex interest me. When I love a man I do not
think (only) of sexual union, but I try to read in him what I am myself
prepared to give: a sole interest, faithfulness, unselfish surrender.
If I love a man, anyone else is nothing to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man of standing of twenty to forty years of age is interesting
to me&mdash;every one who is not positively repulsive&mdash;but most of all
anyone who possesses a distinguished psyche. In isolated cases
sympathy has also led me to love.</p>

<p>&#8220;The kiss is of the highest importance to me, and precisely because
I regard love as created only for a holy purpose, so that human beings
may be mutually ennobled and morally advanced by this passion, it
has always been repulsive to me to observe how men flirt with one
another, just as is the case with heterosexuals. For this reason I am
disinclined to visit places of general resort&mdash;such as, for example, the
Casino of Dresden, where all kinds of people come together. I have
met hardly any other urning who shares my sentiments in this
respect.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A homosexual physician, thirty-two years of age, gives the
following account of his sexuality:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you at what age sexual inclinations first appeared in
me. My sexual impulse is directed towards males. Before and during
the time of puberty the impulse was quite indeterminate. I believe
that at this time I even cherished the idea of some day carrying out
intercourse with a girl. But this was not love; it was a purely
physical desire. The spiritual side of the impulse was at this time
completely wanting. The sexual impulse now extends only towards
young men. I have hitherto had sexual intercourse neither with males
nor with females, but I believe that I should be competent for the
normal sexual act. This act, however, would give me no pleasure; it
would be nothing more than masturbation. I feel complete indifference
towards the female sex, but I do not feel hatred or disgust. Sexual
<span class="nowrap">dreams<a id="FNanchor540"></a><a href="#Footnote540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></span>
relate always to persons of the same sex. On the stage, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page512">[512]</span>
the circus, it is always the men who interest me more than the women.
In addition, I admire celebrated actresses and female singers, but my
interest in them is purely artistic. From this standpoint also I am
fully able to do justice to the beauty of young women, and have
often wished to paint a girl, but this interest is always that of a painter&mdash;the
colour of the hair, the complexion, interesting features. Social
intercourse with persons of the other sex is quite unrestrained. The
sense of shame I feel more in regard to women, but still I have also a
strong sense of shame with regard to men. I always have a great
difficulty to overcome when I have to take off my clothes in the presence
of other men, and it is also very difficult to me to urinate
when other men are present.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love exists only towards youths from the ages of seventeen to
twenty-four, or, to speak more strictly, towards youths at the time of
puberty. One of these of whom I am fond is sixteen years of age,
but sexually he is completely mature, so that every one imagines him
to be twenty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The direction of my sexual impulse has first become perfectly clear
to me since reading the <i>Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages</i>. I
was already fully aware of the fact that young men were especially
interesting to me, but had not previously understood that this interest
was of a sexual nature. I had, indeed, heard of p&aelig;derasty&mdash;the case
of Krupp and others&mdash;but I imagined that these individuals had developed
such a tendency in consequence of satiety. &#8216;You,&#8217; I said to
myself, &#8216;are purer and nobler in sentiment. P&aelig;derasty is loathsome
to you; no human being will ever understand you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every young man at the age of puberty awakens in me a certain
sexual interest. This is especially the case when they are slender and
wiry in build, not fat, with well-developed, but not excessively powerful,
muscles, with gentle and modest character. Roughness always
suffices to destroy completely the commencement of inclination.
Sturdy, plump youths, and those with an excessive development of fat
under the skin, or with a wide, feminine aspect of the buttocks, leave
me comparatively cold. The youthful forms embodied in Grecian
sculpture are my ideal type. It is indispensable that they should be
beardless, or at most have the merest beginnings of a beard. A youth
with a heavy moustache leaves me cold; he is too masculine for me.
Intellectual culture plays no part in the attraction; modesty and
gentleness are necessary to render an intimate relationship possible.
I find no preference for any particular profession. I have, indeed,
pedagogic inclinations, but these appear to me to play no part in
producing attraction, but come into action only later. One whom one
loves is one in whom one would be glad to produce spiritual perfection.
The attraction depends, in the first place, upon beauty of the body;
beauty of the face is only of secondary importance. Smell has no
influence upon the attraction.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It will be noted that this writer, now thirty-two years of age,
has hitherto had no experience of sexual intercourse, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page513">[513]</span>
heterosexual or homosexual. This is characteristic. Homosexuals
in general, in contrast to heterosexuals, often proceed
<b>at a comparatively late age</b> to actual experience of their sexual
impulse in action. He goes on to describe the first beginnings
of his love for a beautiful youth, eighteen years of age. He
writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;My eyes watched every movement of the body, which continually
displayed new beauties. I should have loved to fall upon his neck
and kiss him. For sexual intercourse he appeared to me too pure, too
noble; I should rather have lain before him in the dust and prayed to
his beauty. I felt that I should have been a poet in order to be able
to clothe in the right words this delicate and holy sentiment. And I
must shut this all up within myself, must remain outwardly cold. It
was enough to drive me to madness! Have compassion on us, and
allow us at least an embrace, a kiss. That certainly can do no one any
harm, and for me it would be a good action. The distressing tension
which tortures us to death would be for the time relaxed. I always
have a feeling that the process of sexual attraction must be of an
electrical nature. I seem to myself to be charged with electricity, the
tension increasing up to the highest point when the beloved is near
me, and a prolonged contact or a stroking with the hand already
suffices to bring about a certain calming of the nerves. The tension is
to some degree diminished. The various components of sexual
enjoyment appear to be developed in human beings with very different
strength. In this way it is explicable that in one person the odour of
the loved one, in another the changing tones of the voice, in a third the
taste of the kiss (the tongue kiss), is most stimulating. It is, indeed,
even conceivable that there exists a purely mental sexual enjoyment,
and that to some individuals merely to look at the beloved person, or
to read a letter from him, suffices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sexual intercourse had hitherto never been practised, but I can
asseverate that the mode of my desire is rather feminine. It would be
my ideal if the loved one should feel sexual ardour for me; I should be
a willing sacrifice. I should like to possess feminine sexual organs, in
order to appear desirable to the loved one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have battled powerfully against my nature, and have felt very
unhappy. I regard myself as physically and mentally healthy. I
have received at birth a double nature (alas! two souls dwell within
my breast). My body is that of a man, my soul rather that of a woman;
hence the conflict, hence my sexual desires, considered outwardly and
only from the physical point of view, are contrary to nature. Alas!
my soul can be seen by no one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do I only love a young man? Because he in ideal fashion
enlarges my nature. My sexual sensibility is mainly feminine, and is
directed, therefore, towards the masculine, and more especially towards
the masculine in the time of youth, because the feminine sensibility
in my nature is damped by a small masculine note. The effeminate
urning probably loves the complete man as the best complement of
his own nature. The slightly masculine note of my own sexual perception
demands also in the man whom I love a slight feminine note,
such as we find in the youth. He has, in fact, something feminine<span class="pagenum" id="Page514">[514]</span>
in him&mdash;beardlessness, no immoderate strength of the muscular
system, a gentle disposition, receptive emotions&mdash;and yet he is masculine
and sexually mature. Sexual maturity is a necessary part of
every love. The young man, therefore, is the ideal conception of my
nature. My love is as great, as holy, and as pure, as heterosexual
love; it is capable of self-sacrifice. Believe me, for a loved one who
fully understood me in every respect, I would gladly go to my death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! how painful it is to us when we are regarded as debauchees
or as sick persons!&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>I must say that the above account, given to me by a much
respected medical colleague, one whose nature is characterized
alike by intellectual power and ideal sensibility, has made the
deepest impression upon me, and has been an important influence
in confirming my views regarding the nature of original
homosexuality. Similar oral communications have been received
by me from other physicians who have been homosexual from
childhood onwards, one a neurologist and the other an alienist,
and I attribute the greatest importance to the account given by
this colleague of mine, who has a <b>twofold</b> understanding of the
matter in question&mdash;as physician and as homosexual. It is
also important to note that uranian physicians declare the
majority of homosexuals to be physically and mentally healthy,
a fact which I myself had not previously doubted, and that
they contest the general validity of the degeneration theory.</p>

<p>Whilst in the smaller provincial towns and in the country
homosexuals are for the most part thrust back into themselves,
compelled to conceal their nature, or at most able to communicate
only with isolated individuals of like nature with themselves,
in the larger towns from early days the homosexuals have been
able to get into touch with one another. Certain meeting-places&mdash;places
of rendezvous for urnings only&mdash;have been formed; in
certain <b>streets</b> and <b>squares</b> there have been formed urning-clubs,
boarding-houses, and restaurants, and even urning-balls, while
certain health resorts are to a degree monopolized by them.
Moreover, the individual social groups of the homosexuals form
unions. Thus, for example,
<span class="nowrap">Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor541"></a><a href="#Footnote541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></span> reports the existence
of an evening association consisting exclusively of homosexual
princes, counts, and barons. Such p&aelig;derastic meeting-places
and unions existed in the eighteenth century in Paris. From
this time until about 1840 certain dark lateral alleys of the
Champs Elys&eacute;es, the thickets from the Place de la Concorde to
the All&eacute;e des Veuves, between the Grand Avenue des Champs
Elys&eacute;es and the Cour de la Reine, served from the commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page515">[515]</span>
of twilight for the rendezvous of homosexuals, not simply as a
place of masculine prostitution, but as a meeting-place of urnings
in general, who here in the dark sought and found love. The
central point of this evening activity was the All&eacute;e des Veuves
(now known as the Avenue Montaigne), the &#8220;Widow&#8217;s Alley&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;widow&#8221;
was at that time the term used to denote the passive
p&aelig;derast. This region of the Champs Elys&eacute;es was to a certain
extent monopolized by the homosexuals. They would not
tolerate here the presence of any heterosexuals; they closed the
entrances with cords, and placed guards at the openings of the
alleys, who demanded a pass-word from every comer. Even the
police did not venture into this dark region.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Victor Hugo, who in the year 1831 lived in the Rue Jean Goujon
in this neighbourhood, often accompanied his friends who had been
visiting him part of the way home at a late hour of the night. They
walked in groups, talking of literature and art as far as the Place de la
Concorde. There the celebrated poet parted from his guests and
returned alone homewards, composing new verses by the way. He
often noticed individuals who, as he passed the entrance to the Rue des
Veuves, watched him from afar off without speaking to him. He
could not believe that these people were thieves, and asked himself
what could be the cause of their always waiting in this lonely place;
but notwithstanding the frequent occurrence of these scenes, he made
no further inquiry into the matter. But once in the midst of his
poetical reverie he was disturbed by a man who stepped forward from
the darkness of a thicket, and with a polite greeting said to him: &#8216;Sir,
we beg you not to wait any longer in this place. We know who you
are, and we should not wish that any one of us who does not know you
should cause you any uneasiness.&#8217; &#8216;What are you doing there, then?&#8217;
answered Victor Hugo. &#8216;Every evening I see people walking about here,
and disappearing among the trees.&#8217; &#8216;Don&#8217;t concern yourself about
it, sir,&#8217; was the brisk answer; &#8216;we disturb no one and do no one any
harm, but we shall not permit anyone to disturb us or to do us any
harm; <b>we are here in our own grounds</b>.&#8217; Victor Hugo understood,
bowed, and pursued his way. As on another evening, walking with
his friends, he wished to pass through another alley running parallel
to the All&eacute;e des Veuves, he found that this was closed by a number of
chairs, which were fastened together with cords. &#8216;There is no
thoroughfare,&#8217; called out a threatening voice; but another, speaking
more quietly, added: &#8216;We beg Monsieur Victor Hugo on this occasion
to pass along the other side of the Avenue des Champs
<span class="nowrap">Elys&eacute;es.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor542"></a><a href="#Footnote542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></span></p>

<p>During the Second Empire the All&eacute;e des Veuves maintained
its former position as a place of rendezvous for homosexuals.
An urnings&#8217; club, the members of which belonged to the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page516">[516]</span>
classes of society, being persons of the Imperial Court, senators,
great financiers, etc., had their meeting-place in a beautifully
furnished hotel in the All&eacute;e des Veuves, in which soldiers of the
Empress&#8217;s bodyguard (Dragons de l&#8217;Imp&eacute;ratrice) and of the
Hundred Guard of the Emperor served, in return for valuable
presents, as the beloved of the various distinguished urnings, for
which function the term &#8220;faire l&#8217;Imp&eacute;ratrice&#8221; came into use.
In the hotel there also lived from time to time transient unknown
persons, who were only admitted after showing a kind of medal
bearing a secret inscription. When the police made an examination
of the hotel, they found a number of women&#8217;s dresses
and similar articles, such as those which the Empress Eug&eacute;nie
was accustomed to wear on festival occasions. Numerous letters
were also discovered which had been exchanged by the members
of the club and their favourites of the Hundred Guard or of the
Empress&#8217;s guard. A report was made to the Emperor of the
results of the examination of this house. When he saw that
persons of the highest position, and bearing most celebrated
names, were involved in the affair, he at once ordered that the
matter should be dismissed, and said to the Procureur-General:
&#8220;We must spare our people and our country from such a scandal,
which would do no one any good, and would do a great deal of
harm.&#8221; In fact, almost no details of this affair became
<span class="nowrap">public.<a id="FNanchor543"></a><a href="#Footnote543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></span>
Tardieu gave an account of another urnings&#8217; club of the Second
Empire, where there were concealed closets, on the walls of which
erotic pictures were displayed. The manner in which the
urnings made acquaintance with homosexuals is shown in a
police report of July 16, 1864, in which the conduct of a literary
homosexual, &#8220;un vieux monsieur fort bien et puissamment
riche,&#8221; is described in the following terms:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;He enters the Caf&eacute; Truffaut, sees a young soldier who pleases him.
By the intermediation of the waiter he makes an appointment, and
departs without waiting for an answer. If the soldier agrees, he goes
to the appointed place of meeting, and never goes alone, because
Father <span class="nowrap">C&mdash;&mdash;n</span> (the elderly urning) is well known. As soon as the two
have met, other soldiers make their appearance, beat the old man, and
compel him to give them all the money which he has about him. He
does this willingly, and without ceasing prays for pardon. When he
has not a single sou left, and when he has also given up his watch, he
goes away weeping, and continually repeating the words, &#8216;What a
miserable man I am!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page517">[517]</span></p>

<p>This elderly urning was manifestly also a masochist, and therefore
a very suitable victim of blackmailers, whom we here see at
their work. In the police report to which we have already
referred homosexual orgies are also described, the participants
in which assumed women&#8217;s names and practised mutual masturbation
and fellation, and also carried out obscene practices with
a bitch. When Oscar Metenier in his book &#8220;Vertus et Vices
Allemands&#8221; (Paris, 1904) states that Berlin has a monopoly in the
matter of urnings&#8217; balls, which, in his opinion, were not possible
in Paris, he is unquestionably wrong as regards the time of the
Second Empire. In this police report two typical urnings&#8217; balls
are mentioned. One of these took place in a house in the Place
de la Madeleine, belonging to E. D., a man of business, who gave
the ball on January 2, 1864. The second urnings&#8217; ball was given
by the Vicomte de M. in the Pavilion Rohan, Rue de Rivoli, on
January 16, 1864, at which at least 150 men, many of them in
woman&#8217;s clothing, took part. In many cases the appearance
was so deceptive that even those who had invited the guests were
not always able to determine the sex with certainty.</p>

<p>It is doubtless true that there is no other town in which there
are so many social unions of homosexuals as there are in Berlin.
Hirschfeld records&mdash;in addition to private parties&mdash;dinners, suppers,
evening parties, five o&#8217;clock teas, picnics, dances, and summer
festivals of homosexuals, which are arranged every winter by urnings,
and by female homosexuals or their friends. Moreover, the
male and female homosexuals meet in certain restaurants, caf&eacute;s,
eating-houses, and public-houses frequented only by
<span class="nowrap">themselves.<a id="FNanchor544"></a><a href="#Footnote544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>Such localities exclusively for the use of urnings exist in Berlin
to the number of eighteen to twenty. There are also social
literary unions, such as the club &#8220;Lohengrin,&#8221; the antifeministic
&#8220;Gesellschaft der Eigenen,&#8221; the &#8220;Platen-Gemeinschaft,&#8221; etc.
There are also cabarets (public-houses) for urnings. Hirschfeld,
in his book &#8220;Berlin&#8217;s Third Sex,&#8221; written in a popular
style, but extremely valuable owing to the clearness of his descriptions,
gives an exhaustive account of all these institutions
for urnings, and for further details I may refer my readers to this
interesting work, the authenticity of which I am able to confirm
as the result of my own visits to the above-mentioned places of
meeting for <span class="nowrap">urnings.<a id="FNanchor545"></a><a href="#Footnote545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page518">[518]</span></p>

<p>In Paris there no longer exist places of entertainment frequented
solely by urnings. In this respect they are replaced by
certain Turkish baths, whose patrons are almost without exception
homosexuals&mdash;men whose age varies from about twenty years
upwards. In the industrial quarter, in the neighbourhood of
the Place de la R&eacute;publique, there existed a few years ago a
Turkish bath, visited almost exclusively by young homosexuals
between the ages of fifteen and twenty years. On the great
boulevard there is a bath of a very expensive character, visited
only by wealthy homosexuals, frequented, among others, by a
celebrated French <span class="nowrap">composer.<a id="FNanchor546"></a><a href="#Footnote546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></span></p>

<p>A peculiar species of meeting-places for the urnings of Berlin
is represented by the soldiers&#8217; public-houses in the neighbourhood
of the barracks, where soldiers are met and treated by homosexuals,
and where arrangements are made for subsequent
meetings. There also exists a &#8220;soldiers&#8217; promenade,&#8221; where the
soldiers walk up and down and offer themselves to homosexuals.
Athletes also enter freely into relationships with homosexuals.</p>

<p>Urnings&#8217; balls are to-day especially characteristic of Berlin.
Von Krafft-Ebing has described them in detail, and recently also
Hirschfeld has alluded to them in the above-mentioned work. I
myself not long ago attended such a &#8220;men&#8217;s ball,&#8221; at which from
eight hundred to a thousand homosexuals were present, some in
men&#8217;s clothing, some in women&#8217;s clothing, some in fancy dress.
The homosexuals dressed as women could have been distinguished
from real women only by those in the secret. More particularly
do I recall an elegant sylph, who, on the arm of a partner, glided
across the hall&mdash;&#8220;glided&#8221; is the correct expression. During the
dance his delicate features were leaning on the shoulder of the
man, and he coquetted continually with ardent black eyes. I
really believed this was a woman, but was assured that it was a
male hairdresser. In the case of another urning dressed as a
woman the diagnosis was rendered easier by a well-developed
moustache.</p>

<p>The seamy side of the relationships of homosexuals in public
life is constituted by the so-called &#8220;<b>male prostitution</b>,&#8221; which
existed even in ancient times, and in our own day was especially
well organized during the Second Empire, as we learn from the
details given by Tardieu. The ranks of male prostitution are
recruited partly from homosexual and partly from heterosexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page519">[519]</span>
men of the lower and more poverty-stricken classes, who give
themselves for payment to well-to-do urnings, and are practised
in all the arts of elaborate coquetry (they use rouge, make a
coquettish display of male charms, etc.). These are the so-called
&#8220;aunts.&#8221; In all large towns there exists what is called a
&#8220;Strich&#8221; (promenade), where male prostitutes are accustomed
to walk, in order to attract their clients. In Berlin the
principal promenades are the Friedrichstrasse, the
<span class="nowrap">Passage,<a id="FNanchor547"></a><a href="#Footnote547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></span> and
some of the walks in the Tiergarten. Like female prostitution,
so also male prostitution has its &#8220;<b>houses of accommodation</b>&#8221;;
and in France there even existed, and still exist, typical &#8220;<b>male
brothels</b>.&#8221; From 1820 to 1826 such a brothel was to be found in
the Rue du Doyenne in Paris. In the neighbourhood of the
Louvre the male inmates of this establishment were even subjected
to regular medical examination, in order to protect their
clients from venereal infection. With the fall of twilight the
visitors made their appearance, and were received by young
<span class="nowrap">effeminates.<a id="FNanchor548"></a><a href="#Footnote548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></span>
Still worse was another form of male prostitution,
at the time of the Restoration, and in the earlier years of the reign
of Louis Philippe&mdash;namely, the so-called <i>grande montre des culs</i>
in the Rue des Marais, where a number of male prostitutes displayed
and offered their charms to the homosexuals visiting the
place. A detailed account of the way in which this was done
cannot be given, but is sufficiently indicated by what has already
been <span class="nowrap">said.<a id="FNanchor549"></a><a href="#Footnote549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>Male brothels exist even at the present day in Paris. Thus,
at the end of the year 1905 in the Rue St. Martin there was a small
hotel whose homosexual proprietor not only let rooms to urnings
for a brief stay, but also kept on the premises five or six young
men between the ages of fifteen and twenty-two years, whose
services were always available for homosexuals for payment.
Besides this hotel there existed also in the year 1905 a kind of
male brothel in the house of an urning, where at midday half
a dozen young fellows were to be found, or could be fetched at
brief notice, for the choice of homosexual visitors, for whose use
a room was available at so many francs per
<span class="nowrap">hour.<a id="FNanchor550"></a><a href="#Footnote550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page520">[520]</span></p>

<p>A phenomenon intimately related with male prostitution is
<b>blackmail</b>, or &#8220;<b>chantage</b>.&#8221; Tardieu (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 128-130)
describes these relationships in vivid colours, and lays stress on
the close relationship between male prostitution and criminality.
Blackmail has become to-day a kind of special
<span class="nowrap">profession,<a id="FNanchor551"></a><a href="#Footnote551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></span> which
is not directed solely against homosexuals, but also against
heterosexuals, and the punishment of which cannot be too
severe. Frequently these individuals, whose activity is a danger
to the community at large, persecute their victims for many
years in succession. Tardieu reports the case of a celebrated
literary man, &#8220;whose purse the blackmailers regarded as their
own.&#8221; <b>For more than twenty years in succession</b> he was plucked
by successive generations of blackmailers, who considered him an
assured source of income. He was &#8220;passed on from one to
another.&#8221; As a rule, blackmailers wait for their victims in public
lavatories; they suddenly assert that they have been indecently
assaulted, and demand hush-money, which is commonly given
to them, even by heterosexuals. A case of the last-mentioned
kind recently occurred in Berlin, when a quite innocent young
merchant was being plundered in this way, and his wife, by a
courageous denunciation of the shameless blackmailer, freed him
from this tyranny. It is, however, unquestionable that blackmail
often ensues upon real advances on the part of homosexuals,
and after the performance of sexual acts; and there is no doubt
that in Germany the existence of &sect; 175 of the Criminal Code has
been most advantageous to professional blackmailers, has led to
numerous scandals (alike disagreeable and dangerous to the community),
and has given rise to numerous suicides.</p>

<p>This celebrated &sect; 175 runs as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Unnatural vice between two persons of the male sex, or between
a man and an animal, is punishable with imprisonment; it can also
be punished with loss of civil rights.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This paragraph of the Imperial Criminal Code is identical with
&sect; 143 of the former Prussian Criminal Code. Similar
<span class="nowrap">ordinances,<a id="FNanchor552"></a><a href="#Footnote552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></span>
in some cases even more severe, are found in the laws of Austria-Hungary,
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Bulgaria, the
State of New York, most of the cantons of Switzerland, and
more especially in Great Britain, where the most severe punishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page521">[521]</span>
are inflicted, and, at any rate logically, are inflicted also
on women who practise homosexual intercourse. On the other
hand, punishment for homosexual intercourse has been completely
<b>abolished</b> in France, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Turkey,
Italy, Spain, the Swiss Cantons of Genf, Wallis, Waadt and
Tessin, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, the Principality of
Monaco, and in Mexico.</p>

<p>&sect; 143 of the Prussian Criminal Code was adopted as the basis
of &sect; 175 of the German Criminal Code, in view of &#8220;the consciousness
of right of the people,&#8221; who &#8220;condemn such practices not
only as vicious, but also as criminal.&#8221; But this consciousness
of right is based upon defective knowledge, and upon an erroneous
view of homosexuality. As soon as we recognize that in homosexuality
we have to do with a primary natural disposition, and
as soon as this view has permeated wide circles of the population,
the old consciousness of right will be replaced by a <b>new</b> one,
<b>which will demand the repeal of a criminal law</b>, by which <b>a natural
phenomenon</b> is regarded as a vice and a crime, and is esteemed
as infamous. My studies in recent years having convinced me
that in homosexuality we have to do with a typical biological
phenomenon, I feel that I must unhesitatingly approve of the
efforts of the <b>Scientific and Humanitarian Committee</b>, founded
by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, which aims at making the people
understand the nature of homosexuality, and demands the repeal
of &sect; 175 of the German Criminal Code. All the more is this
reform demanded because real homosexual <b>crimes</b> can be very
readily dealt with by means of the sections of the Criminal Code
relating to sexual delinquencies in general.</p>

<p>Apart from this general codification of the injustice of &sect; 175,
and apart from the above-mentioned tragical consequences of
the existence of this section, it is also necessary to point out that
the expressions used therein are absurd and illogical.</p>

<p>1. Unnatural vice between men is punished, whereas that
between women is left impune. But why should this latter be
the case, if we adopt the standpoint (which we have, indeed, seen
to be untenable) that homosexual intercourse is in itself vicious
and criminal&mdash;why should homosexual intercourse between
women be less vicious and criminal than homosexual intercourse
between men?</p>

<p>2. The idea &#8220;unnatural vice&#8221; is equally absurd and inconsequent,
and makes justice in respect of these offences absolutely
impossible. By this term is understood not merely p&aelig;dication
(<i>immissio membri in anum</i>), but also any kind of intercourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page522">[522]</span>
between men &#8220;resembling sexual intercourse&#8221;&mdash;that is, <i>coitus
in os</i>, <i>coitus inter femora</i>, even simple <i>frictio membri</i>&mdash;whilst
mutual masturbation and other perverse practices are not
punishable.</p>

<p>3. &sect; 175 does not safeguard any
<span class="nowrap">citizen,<a id="FNanchor553"></a><a href="#Footnote553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></span> for the sexual freedom
of the individual is not disturbed in any way by the intercourse
between two adult men who fully understand what they are
doing, nor is the general moral sense injured in any way if the
act is not seen by any third person. In this latter respect, however,
&sect; 183 of the Criminal Code, which punishes annoyance to the
public by improper conduct, already affords sufficient protection.</p>

<p>4. If &sect; 175 is maintained with especial reference to the existence
of professional male unchastity, von Liszt has rightly replied
to this contention that the latter form of unchastity can be
rendered harmless by a modified reading of &sect; 361<i>b</i> of the Criminal
Code, just as the protection of virtue can be safeguarded by other
sections of the Code.</p>

<p>5. The effectiveness of &sect; 175 is extremely limited. According
to Hirschfeld (&#8220;Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages,&#8221; vol. vi.,
p. 175), no more than 0&middot;007&nbsp;% of the existing punishable homosexual
practices of the present day are detected and punished.
Therefore a few <b>isolated</b> individuals are punished for an offence
which thousands of others commit with impunity.</p>

<p>6. When &sect; 175 of the Criminal Code was drawn up, the law-givers
knew absolutely nothing about the homosexual impulse
as an essential outcome of the personality; they merely wished
to punish heterosexuals who committed homosexual practices,
not to punish genuine homosexuals (<i>cf.</i> Numa Pr&aelig;torius, &#8220;The
Question of the Responsibility of Homosexuals,&#8221; published in
the <i>Monthly Review of Criminal Psychology</i>, edited by G. Aschaffenburg,
1906, p. 561).</p>

<p>The worst and most tragic consequence of &sect; 175 is the permanent
infamy and social contempt suffered by persons who, <b>without
any blame to themselves</b>, have a mode of sexual perception diverging
from that of the great majority. The state itself commits a
crime when it enrols in the category of vice and crime a biological
phenomenon which has recently been recognized as such even
by the Evangelical and Catholic
<span class="nowrap">Churches,<a id="FNanchor554"></a><a href="#Footnote554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></span>
and has been freed<span class="pagenum" id="Page523">[523]</span>
by these Churches from the stigma of immorality. The continuance
of this great injustice is the frequent cause of the
<b>suicide</b> of homosexuals, especially of such as are men of exceptional
spiritual and moral cultivation, and <b>frequently before
they have actually indulged in their homosexual impulse</b>, the best
proof that we have to do, not with vicious, but with unhappy
men, who are unable to bear the misery of being socially despised
and unjustly misunderstood by their associates. How many
suicides from homosexual grounds occur it is impossible to
establish exactly. We can only suspect the cause from certain
attendant circumstances. A highly respected literary man
writes to me regarding this question of the suicide of homosexuals:
&#8220;When a fine young fellow, suffering frightfully as a
result of his inherited disposition, shoots himself, his family will
rather suggest that the cause was a chancre (which he has never
had), than they will admit his homosexuality.&#8221; Several such
cases have come under his notice. &#8220;A better cause,&#8221; he suggests,
&#8220;for the suicide would have been unhappy love, for that is the
actual truth.&#8221; <span class="nowrap">Zola,<a id="FNanchor555"></a><a href="#Footnote555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></span>
speaking of the letters of a homosexual,
says that they exhibited &#8220;the most heart-breaking cry of human
agony&#8221; that he had ever known.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;He earnestly resisted yielding to such shameful, lustful love, and
he longed to know whence came this contempt of all men, whence this
continuous readiness of the law-courts to crush him down, when in his
flesh and blood were inborn a disgust towards woman, whilst he had
brought into the world with him a true feeling of love towards man.
Never had one possessed by a demon, never had a poor human body
given up to and tortured by the unknown powers of the sexual impulse,
so painfully expressed his misery. Have we not here a truly
physiological case definitely displayed before our eyes&mdash;an inversion,
an error, on the part of Nature? Nothing, in my opinion, is more
tragical, and nothing demands more urgently investigation and a
means of cure, if such can possibly be found.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The <b>complete enlightenment</b> of the people would give rise to a
spontaneous change in their conception of homosexuality, to
which, moreover, the greater number of homosexuals belonging
to the better classes could contribute, if they would freely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page524">[524]</span>
openly admit their tendencies. The secrecy and hypocrisy of
many urnings is partly responsible for the hitherto prevailing
false views on homosexuality. We cannot spare them this
reproach.</p>

<p>Finally, &sect; 175 is not merely an injustice to homosexuals, but it
is also a danger to heterosexuals, in consequence of the <b>blackmail</b>
which is so intimately associated with the existence of this section.
It is not enough that these criminals of the most debased kind,
who to a small extent only are recruited from the ranks of male
prostitutes, reduce numerous unhappy urnings to social and
financial ruin, and drive many others to suicide or to crime, of
which the remarkable case of a County Court Judge a few years
ago afforded a typical example. These wretches also dare with
ever-greater success to make use of &sect; 175 for the purpose of blackmailing
<b>completely normal heterosexuals</b>. In fact, they often
succeed better with these latter than they do with homosexuals,
because to the normal man the idea of being regarded as homosexual
is so repulsive.</p>

<p>A remedy for all these evils&mdash;for the suicides as well as for the
blackmailing&mdash;can only be found in the <b>enlightenment</b> of the
whole people&mdash;the first and most important thing to do&mdash;and
in the <b>unconditional repeal</b> of &sect; 175 of the Criminal Code.</p>

<p>It has been a most useful service on the part of the Scientific
and Humanitarian Committee&mdash;a service the value of which has
not yet been sufficiently recognized&mdash;that it has endeavoured,
above all, to bring about the enlightenment of the people by
means of popular <span class="nowrap">writings,<a id="FNanchor556"></a><a href="#Footnote556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></span>
and of the learned by means of
scientific publications, such as the most successful <i>Annual for
Sexual Intermediate Stages</i> (8 volumes, 1899-1906), and by
means of lectures, by the convocation of public meetings, by
petitions, etc.</p>

<p>The petition of the committee to the legislative bodies of the
German Empire, asking for the repeal of &sect; 175 of the Criminal
Code, was signed by 5,000 persons belonging to the circles of men
of science, judges, physicians, priests, schoolmasters, authors,
and artists, among whom were some of the most celebrated
names of cultured Germany. I cite here a few only: Ferdinand
Avenarius, Hans von Basedow, Woldemar von Biedermann,

<p>In addition, we might mention that in the year 1904 not less
than 2,800 German physicians, as well as 750 head masters and
masters of higher schools, signed the petition to the Reichstag
for the repeal of &sect; 175. Owing to certain scandals by which the
highest circles were sympathetically affected&mdash;I need recall only
the cases of Hohenau, Krupp, Israel, von Schenk, etc.&mdash;the
conviction has been forced upon members of the most influential
political circles that the repeal of the paragraphs of the Criminal
Code relating to urnings is an unconditional necessity. We may,
therefore, expect that the repeal will be effected within the next
few years.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">Compared with true original homosexuality in men, the same
condition in women is of considerably less importance, because
in women homosexuality is undoubtedly <b>much less common</b> than
it is in men. In comparison with the number of urnings, the
number of <b>female homosexuals</b>&mdash;of &#8220;<b>urnindes</b>,&#8221; &#8220;<b>Lesbian
lovers</b>,&#8221; or &#8220;<b>tribades</b>&#8221;&mdash;is relatively small; whereas in many
women, even at a comparatively advanced age, the so-called
&#8220;pseudo-homosexuality&#8221; (see the next chapter) is much more
frequently met with than it is in men. In the case of heterosexual
men it is usually impossible to induce a homosexual
mode of perception or to give rise to any kind of taste for homosexual
activity; whereas in heterosexual women the corresponding
change certainly occurs much more easily. Tendernesses
and caresses play, indeed, among normal heterosexual women a
r&ocirc;le which makes it easier for us to understand how readily in
woman pseudo-homosexual tendencies may arise. <b>Still, it is
impossible to doubt the existence also of original homosexuality<span class="pagenum" id="Page526">[526]</span>
in women.</b> These are the cases in which, just as in urnings, the
homosexual impulse appears in very early childhood, often long
before puberty, in which case also the girl is distinguished from
her heterosexual comrades in external appearance, exhibiting
indications of a masculine build of body (slight development of
the breasts, narrowness of the pelvis, development of a moustache,
a deep voice, etc.); but such indications may be entirely
absent, and the girl may not be distinguished from others in
any respect beyond the perverse direction of the sexual impulse.
These true tribades are much rarer than the false tribades, the
pseudo-Lesbian lovers. For example, when visiting an urnings&#8217;
ball we may be quite sure that 99&nbsp;% of the male homosexuals
assembled there are true homosexuals; but at a tribades&#8217; ball&mdash;such,
also, are given in Berlin&mdash;certainly a much smaller percentage
are &#8220;genuine&#8221;; the bulk of the women present are
pseudo-homosexuals. I here append the interesting reminiscences
of a genuine urninde, by which this relationship between
original homosexuality and pseudo-homosexuality in women is
very clearly shown:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">Thoughts of a Lonely Woman!</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Born in the country, the daughter of a merchant, I grew up as
a very dreamy being, with an unceasing yearning after something
unknown, beautiful, great&mdash;with a longing to become a singer or an
artist. At the age of twelve I was already completely &#8216;woman,&#8217; very
luxuriantly developed, although still half a child, <b>filled always with
an uncontrollable longing for a beloved feminine being who should
kiss me and caress me</b>, whom I was to regard with love and with a
sentiment of self-sacrifice. At the age of thirteen I came to live with
relatives in a provincial town, where for a year I attended a young
ladies&#8217; school. Of my dreams no single one could be fulfilled. My
mother, who was widowed when I was only three years old, had a
severe economical struggle, being encumbered with six small children.
After my elder brothers and sisters were married, I myself, being then
twenty-four years of age, had to go out into the world to seek my own
living, ignorant of the world and its dangers, delivered up to commonness
and intrigue. I got a position in the house of a widow, filling the
post of &#8216;companion.&#8217; My &#8216;principal,&#8217; a woman sixty years of age,
was at first unsympathetic to me, but she treated me in a loving and
motherly manner, which pleased me, for I was of a pliant and receptive
disposition. Gradually I became her confidante. Every evening I
had to get into bed with her (I slept close by); I must touch her with
my hands. I did not then really understand why I had to stroke her
legs; but one evening this sexagenarian guided my hand into a forbidden
place. Now it became clear to me that this woman still had
erotic perceptions. I felt how she quivered under my touch, pressed
me firmly to herself, etc.; but I, for my part, felt nothing. It might<span class="pagenum" id="Page527">[527]</span>
have been different had she been a friend of my own age. I had not
at that time any idea that &#8216;psychically&#8217; I was different from other
girls. I had an unceasing yearning for love, not directly sensual
love, but spiritual love, out of which sensual love might later develop.
Among the inmates of our house was a young merchant, a fine-looking
man, who besieged me with his love, and, after long hesitation, I at
length one day consented to give him the best that woman has to
give. He took possession of my body with brutal voluptuousness. I
was under the delusion that he would make me his wife. I had in
the sexual act <b>no perception at all</b>, and was disillusioned. One day
my seducer told me that he was going to be married, asking me to
return him the ring he had given me, and offering me money. Moved
to the inmost soul, without any human being to give me counsel or
help (from a feeling of shame I had not disclosed the matter to my
principal), I threw the ring at him, resigned my position, and made
myself independent. I will only say in a few words how I had to struggle,
to fight for my existence, how I was lied to and deceived by rascally
men. When I came to Berlin I heard and read of homosexual love,
but could not find what I dreamed of&mdash;namely, spiritual love, out of
which sensual love might spring. I learned to know homosexual
women, but they exhibited to me such elemental passion, brutality,
sensuality, that, notwithstanding all my yearning for &#8216;homosexual&#8217;
love, I remained unresponsive. Only in kissing the lips of a woman
sympathetic to me I have experienced an agreeable sensation, but
that sweet state which I was able to induce in others by contact with
them was <b>in me</b> not forthcoming. I began to wonder whether Nature
had denied me this sensation, though I was myself also a normally
developed woman. For years I lived &#8216;ascetically,&#8217; since I regarded
myself as a &#8216;psychological&#8217; problem&mdash;I avoided every kind of intercourse&mdash;I
only had a desire for tenderness and caresses. I often loved
handsome women, feeling the wish to kiss them and to touch them,
and I had learned to know women of the kind who prostitute themselves
to other women for money. These were hateful to me, and never could
I form a friendship with such, because they knew only common brutal
sensuality, towards which I was not responsive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some years ago I suffered from a severe abdominal and nervous
disorder. I have already passed my fortieth year. After an illness
lasting two years, I still feel the desire for homosexual love. Hitherto
I have lived unhappily, continually asking myself why Nature has
treated me so cruelly. Is it not possible once at least to enjoy this
perception? A few weeks ago I made the acquaintance of a married
woman, whose husband has been impotent for years, whilst she, on
the other hand, is a very passionate character. Unfortunately, this
woman, although in other respects she is very sympathetic to me, is
upon a comparatively low plane of culture, and, what frightens me
more, she has an intimacy with a female friend who is quite uncultured,
but who resembles her in respect of sexual love, and who night after
night lies with her in bed <b>beside the husband</b>, and the two women indulge
their perverse voluptuousness, the friend playing the &#8216;man&#8217;s&#8217; part. I
have seen many strange things in my course through life, but <b>such a
marriage</b> is a new experience to me. The man terms himself an artist,
a painter, and allows his wife free play in bisexual love. I believe that
this man himself experiences a titillation of the senses when he sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page528">[528]</span>
the two women together, and also that he makes drawings of &#8216;acts,&#8217;
out of which he makes a profit. In this house I have seen into a deep
abyss, yet other bisexual women visit it. Although I have found my
peace disturbed by these women, although I have been to a certain
extent intoxicated, the conditions are too repulsive to me&mdash;since this
woman is sunk into a morass deeper than she herself understands.
Only through me does she begin to understand it. But a longer
intercourse with her is impossible, for she lacks all the qualities that I
look for in a woman whom I could love. In actual fact I envy this
creature, for she is happy, since she experiences to the full those
sweet sensations which Nature denies to me. Are there any more
beings unhappy like myself? Perhaps the acquaintanceship with a
woman whose feelings were similar to my own would be a happiness,
if Fate would only have so much pity upon me as to throw a sorrowful
companion in my way. I hope for it, but I do not believe that it will
happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;To what sex do I really belong?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the love-history of this genuine urninde the ideal element
is especially manifest; likewise the instinctive disinclination to
man, which, remarkably enough, is often more powerfully developed
in strongly feminine characters than in the more masculine
tribades, as the prototype of which latter we may mention
the painter Rosa Bonheur. During childhood Rosa Bonheur
felt herself to be a boy, and preferred the society of boys to that
of <span class="nowrap">girls.<a id="FNanchor557"></a><a href="#Footnote557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></span>
Throughout her life, notwithstanding her homosexual
love, she felt strong sympathy with men. Such a double
relationship occurs also among urnindes of the first kind. Even
the true urninde, I may say, is <b>not so extremely homosexual</b> as is
the true urning. Take, for example, the following
<span class="nowrap">account<a id="FNanchor558"></a><a href="#Footnote558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></span> of
an original homosexual, and you will see the difference:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I have not lost any of the valuable things of life&mdash;far otherwise.
Many-sided, many-shadowed intellectual sympathy leads any man of
lofty mind into harmony with me. There emanates unconsciously
from my soul a profound, tender charm. My friends find me necessary
to them. I share their interests. In our relationship there pass
between us the most wonderful shades of sympathetic feeling&mdash;what
the French so expressively speak of as <i>l&#8217;amiti&eacute; amoureuse</i>. Thus my
mode of being becomes absorbed into that of my friend, a peculiar
melody passes to and fro between us, and a peculiar melody sounds in
the stillness of my own soul. All the fine and delicate sensations which
I have received from my friends become in me transformed into
poietic force&mdash;the ecstasies of my spirit assume form and substance.
From the spiritualization of the impulse there springs a stream clear
as crystal, there arise passion and ardour; my exceptional soul lifts
me upwards, above all sorrows and vexations. In this way is a talent
conceived, and amid ecstasy it is born.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page529">[529]</span></p>

<p>The need for a spiritual contact with men is among homosexual
women much stronger than the corresponding inclination
on the part of urnings for spiritual contact with woman natures.
For this reason there is no doubt that the &#8220;<b>Woman&#8217;s Movement</b>&#8221;&mdash;that
is, in the movement directed towards the acquirement
by women of all the attainments of masculine culture&mdash;homosexual
women have played a notable
<span class="nowrap">part.<a id="FNanchor559"></a><a href="#Footnote559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></span> Indeed,
according to one <span class="nowrap">author,<a id="FNanchor560"></a><a href="#Footnote560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></span>
the &#8220;Woman&#8217;s Question&#8221; is mainly
the question regarding the destiny of virile homosexual women.
I find it necessary to doubt whether, as Hammer
<span class="nowrap">maintains,<a id="FNanchor561"></a><a href="#Footnote561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></span> the
raging hatred of men&mdash;the converse quality to the anti-feminism
of the male urnings&mdash;really proceeds from the uranian group of
the Woman&#8217;s Movement, for there exist no literary documents of
importance to prove the suggested connexion. Homosexual
women of intellectual weight have also assured me that among
them there does at times exist an enmity to men on principle,
just as, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, misogyny has been developed as a
system both from the heterosexual and from the homosexual
side. For the diffusion of pseudo-homosexuality the Woman&#8217;s
Movement is of great importance, as we shall see later.</p>

<p>The individual and social relationships of feminine uranism are
nearly the same as those of male uranism. In both cases there
exists an entire scale, running from pure Platonism to ardent
sensuality. One kind of Platonic tribades are those described
by Catulle Mend&eacute;s in his sketch &#8220;Protectrices.&#8221; These are
ladies of position who allow themselves the luxury of a &#8220;prot&eacute;g&eacute;e,&#8221;
generally a girl employed at the theatre, with whom
during the performances they exchange glances, whose expenses
they pay, with whom they go out driving, without the matter
proceeding to actual sexual relations. In other cases, however,
sensual gratification is the desired goal, which is attained by
kisses, embraces, friction of the genital organs, or cuninilinctus
(the so-called &#8220;<b>Sapphism</b>&#8221;). In this intercourse one party&mdash;the
&#8220;father&#8221;&mdash;plays the active part, the other&mdash;&#8220;the mother&#8221;&mdash;the
passive part. There exist passionate and intimate relationships
of long duration&mdash;true &#8220;marriages&#8221;&mdash;among tribades.
Thus, d&#8217;Estoc reports (&#8220;Paris-Eros,&#8221; p. 58) relationships of this
kind which have lasted thirty years. Still, as a general rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page530">[530]</span>
feminine homosexuals change their relationships more frequently
than male homosexuals. An elderly tribade, whose correspondence
lies before me, had within four years three love relationships.
In these relationships jealousy plays an even greater
part than in heterosexual liaisons. Two sympathetic urnindes
who lived together described to me very vividly the joys and
sorrows of the <i>amor lesbicus</i>. The cause of the troubles is always
a <i>tertia</i>, never a <i>tertius gaudens</i>.</p>

<p>Like the urnings, the tribades also have their meeting-places,
<i>jour fixes</i>. One such meeting, at which four genuine female
homosexuals and one male homosexual assembled, I had the
opportunity of attending. They have their parties, and even
their balls, at which the virile tribades appear in men&#8217;s
<span class="nowrap">clothing,<a id="FNanchor562"></a><a href="#Footnote562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></span>
and (as also when at home) use male nicknames. There also
exist female prostitutes who devote their services entirely to
urnindes. This tribadistic prostitution is especially widespread
in Paris. Such prostitutes are called <i>gouines</i>, or <i>gougnottes</i>, or
<i>chevali&egrave;res du clair de lune</i>. Theatrical agents are said to be
especially occupied with tribadistic procurement. There also
exist tribadistic brothels in
<span class="nowrap">Paris.<a id="FNanchor563"></a><a href="#Footnote563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>APPENDIX<br />
THEORY OF HOMOSEXUALITY</h3>

<p>Original, congenital, enduring homosexuality would appear to
be an exclusively human peculiarity. It is very doubtful whether
a similar condition exists among animals. We recognize among
the lower animals homosexual acts, but no
<span class="nowrap">homosexuality.<a id="FNanchor564"></a><a href="#Footnote564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></span>
Thus we have no philogenetic starting-point for the explanation
of homosexuality. Moreover, homosexuality is fundamentally
different from the other sexual perversions, sadism and
masochism. These represent quite <b>extreme</b> forms of biological
phenomena, an abnormal increase of physiological impulsive
manifestations that occur in the normal heterosexual life, as
part of sexuality in general. But homosexuality is an alteration
<b>in the direction of the very impulse itself</b>&mdash;a change in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page531">[531]</span>
nature of sexuality. To put the matter shortly, it is the appearance
of a sexuality <b>heterogeneous to and not corresponding with
the bodily structure</b>. To define homosexuality as the appearance
of a feminine sexual psyche in a masculine body, or of a masculine
sexual psyche in a feminine body, does not apply to all cases&mdash;for
example, it does not apply to virile urnings or to tribades who
remain womanly. The definition of homosexuality as a sexuality
which does not correspond to the bodily structure embraces both
these possibilities.</p>

<p>Whenever homosexuality in men is associated with a marked
development of feminine secondary sexual characters, or in
women with a marked development of masculine secondary
sexual characters, the homosexual sensibility may be said to
have to some extent a physical basis, but not completely so.
For the &#8220;intermediate stage theory&#8221; proposed by Hirschfeld&mdash;the
intermixture of feminine and masculine characters&mdash;may
apply satisfactorily to &#8220;bisexuality,&#8221; to indeterminate sexual
sensibility; but it does not apply to the thoroughly one-sided,
monistic sexual sensibility, directed <b>only</b> towards members of
the same sex, and often appearing very early, before the days of
puberty. Moreover, in heterosexual male individuals the external
appearance may at times suggest that there is a strong
intermixture of feminine characters. These men, though heterosexual,
have a womanly appearance.</p>

<p>The &#8220;intermediate stage theory&#8221; of Hirschfeld, which von
Krafft-Ebing also appears to have recognized in his last work
(&#8220;New Studies in the Subject of Homosexuality&#8221;), a theory
which explains homosexual phenomena as dependent upon the
existence of transitional stages between the sexes (&#8220;sexual
links&#8221; of Hirschfeld), and which, moreover, erroneously includes
the typical hermaphrodite states&mdash;this interesting theory explains
<b>a portion only</b> of original homosexuality. It fails in cases
<b>in which homosexuality occurs in the absence of any divergence
from type</b>&mdash;for example, in those cases in which male individuals
with thoroughly normal masculine bodies exhibit marked homosexual
sensibility in early childhood, long before puberty. But
these are the cases which offer the greatest possible difficulties
to a scientific explanation. <i>Hic Rhodus, hic salta!</i></p>

<p>Ulrich&#8217;s &#8220;feminine soul in a masculine body&#8221; applies to
<b>effeminate urnings</b>, such as he was himself. But is the mode of
sensibility of <b>virile</b> homosexuals &#8220;effeminate&#8221;? Why do we
speak of a third sex? Here lie difficulties which we cannot
overcome without further assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page532">[532]</span></p>

<p>How does it come to pass that the central organs in homosexuals
do not correspond to the peripheral sexual organs,
although the latter are formed embryologically long before the
former, so that the central organs should properly be guided in
their development by the peripheral organs? But they are not
so guided. That is only explicable in this way&mdash;that the association
between the central organs and the peripheral organs is
interrupted by a third influence, and that <b>this last influence has
a peculiar effect</b> upon the central organs <b>altogether independent
of the nature of the reproductive glands</b>.</p>

<p>I will formulate this new theory of homosexuality in the
following terms:</p>

<p>1. The so-called &#8220;undifferentiated stage&#8221; of the sexual impulse
(Max Dessoir) may often fail to appear in cases in which the
sexual impulse, either in heterosexuals or homosexuals, is definitely
directed before puberty unmistakably towards the members
of one particular sex. Especially in homosexuals do we often
see <b>before</b> puberty the clear and unmistakable direction of the
sexual impulse towards members of the <b>same</b> sex.</p>

<p>2. A critical theory of homosexuality must also explain the
extreme cases; above all, it must also explain male homosexuality
associated with complete virility.</p>

<p>3. The sexual organs and the reproductive glands cannot be the
determining cause, because homosexuality makes its appearance
in association with thoroughly typical male reproductive organs;
nor can the brain be the determining cause in cases of true homosexuality,
for, notwithstanding the intentional and unintentional
operation of heterosexual influences on thought and imagination,
homosexuality cannot be eradicated, and continues to
develop.</p>

<p>4. Since this homosexuality often makes its appearance as an
inclination (not as the sexual impulse) long <b>before</b> puberty, and
<b>before</b> the proper activity of the reproductive glands is developed,
it appears a reasonable suggestion that in homosexuality some
physiological manifestation associated with &#8220;sexuality,&#8221; but
not directly associated with the reproductive glands, undergoes a
<b>change</b> which results in an alteration of the direction of the sexual
impulse.</p>

<p>6. The most obvious influences to think of in this connexion
are <b>chemical</b> influences, changes in the chemistry of sexual
tension, which latter is certainly to a large extent <b>independent</b> of
the reproductive glands, since it may persist in eunuchs. But
the nature of this sexual chemistry is still entirely obscure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page533">[533]</span></p>

<p>Such a way of conceiving the process is thoroughly reasonable
and tenable on scientific grounds, as was shown by E. H.
Starling and L. <span class="nowrap">Krehl<a id="FNanchor565"></a><a href="#Footnote565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></span>
in their communication to the Scientific
Congress at Stuttgart in the year 1905, regarding disturbances of
chemical correlation in the organism, especially disturbances of
the chemical influences proceeding from the reproductive organs.
All minuter details regarding these &#8220;sexual hormone&#8221; (to use
Starling&#8217;s own phrase) are still unknown, but the experiments
to which we alluded in an earlier chapter have proved their
existence. In my view, the anatomical contradiction, the natural
monstrosity, of a feminine&mdash;or, at any rate, an unmanly&mdash;psyche
in a typical masculine body, or that of a feminine or unmanly
sexual psyche associated with normally developed and normally
functioning male genital organs, can only be explained in this
manner by taking into account this intercurrent third factor.
This can be deduced very readily from some early <b>embryonic
disturbances</b> of sexual chemistry. This would also explain why
it is that homosexuality so often occurs in perfectly healthy
families, as an isolated phenomenon which has nothing to do either
with inheritance or with degeneration. When von R&ouml;mer, on
the contrary, describes homosexuality as a process of &#8220;regeneration,&#8221;
we must maintain that for this view there are no sufficient
grounds. Here begins the <b>riddle</b> of homosexuality; for me, at
any rate, it is one. My own theory only attempts to explain the
proper physiological connexions of homosexuality better, and,
above all, more scientifically than earlier theories. With regard
to the ultimate cause of the relatively frequent occurrence of
homosexuality as an original phenomenon, this theory has,
however, nothing to say.</p>

<p>I do not suggest that I am able for a moment to find the
ultimate reason of the being and nature of homosexuality. There
remains here a riddle to be solved. But from the standpoint of
civilization and reproduction homosexuality is a senseless and
aimless dysteleological phenomenon, like many another &#8220;natural
product&#8221;&mdash;as, for example, the human c&aelig;cum. In an earlier
chapter I drew attention to the fact that civilization has entailed
an increasingly sharp sexual differentiation&mdash;that is, the antithesis
between &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; has become continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page534">[534]</span>
clearer. The distinction between the sexes is a product rather of
civilization than of primitive nature. All sexual indifference,
all sexual links, are primitive characters. Eduard von Mayer
rightly believes that in the earliest days of the human race
homosexuality was much more widely diffused than it is at
present, that, in fact, it came into being side by side with heterosexual
love. Civilization by means of inheritance, adaptation,
and differentiation, has continually more and more limited the
extent of the homosexual impulse. Unquestionably the homosexual
human being, <b>as human being</b>, has the same right to exist
as the heterosexual. To doubt it would be preposterous. Also,
as a sexual being, in so far as only the individual aspect of love
comes under consideration, the homosexual has an equal right.
But for the species, and also for the advancement of civilization,
homosexuality has no importance, or very little. It is obvious
that, as a kind of enduring &#8220;monosexuality,&#8221; it contradicts the
purposes of the species. Equally obvious is it that the whole of
civilization is the product of the physical and mental differentiation
of the sexes, that civilization has, in fact, to a certain extent,
a heterosexual character. The greatest spiritual values we owe
to heterosexuals, not to homosexuals. <b>Moreover, reproduction
first renders possible the preservation and permanence of new
spiritual values.</b> In the last resort the latter are not possible
without the former. However obvious it may appear, we must
still repeat that spiritual values exist only in respect of the
<b>future</b>, that they only attain their true significance <b>in the connexion
and the succession of the generations</b>, and that they are,
therefore, eternally dependent upon heterosexual love as the
intermediary by which this continuity is produced. The monosexual
and homosexual instincts permanently limited to their
own ego or their own sex are, therefore, in their innermost nature
<b>dysteleological</b> and <b>anti-evolutionistic</b>. In speaking thus we
leave entirely out of consideration the possibility that temporarily
and for the purposes of individual development they
may possess a relative
<span class="nowrap">justification.<a id="FNanchor566"></a><a href="#Footnote566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, the majority of homosexuals have a deeply rooted
sentiment of the lack of purpose and the aimlessness of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page535">[535]</span>
mode of sexual perception, and this often gives them a very
tragical and pitiable expression. Especially in the case of noble,
spiritually important homosexuals, true carriers of civilization,
is this sense of the incongruity between homosexuality and life
most plainly felt. Even the talented Numa Pr&aelig;torius (<i>Annual
for Sexual Intermediate Stages</i>, vol. vi., p. 543) recognizes that&mdash;</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The love of the majority of men towards the other sex, based upon
heterosexual impulse, has undergone a development and refinement,
and has obtained a significance which makes homosexual love, in
comparison with it, play quite a subordinate part.&#8221;</p>

type. The same is true as regards the description of the corresponding types

This occurs also in heterosexual boys. I extract the following passage from
the unpublished autobiography of a homosexual <b>physician</b>: &#8220;When puberty
occurred I am not able to say&mdash;I expect it was about the age of sixteen or seventeen&mdash;but
I know certainly that I noticed at the time of puberty a swelling of the
breasts. There was only a slight forward curvature, which did not extend much
beyond the areola, and was painful on pressure. I remember distinctly that
I was anxious about the matter, and was afraid that there was some inflammation
beginning. <b>However, the same seems to occur in every normal man.</b> A
student whom I asked about the matter said that he had noticed a swelling of
the mammary glands about the age of fifteen; recently, at the age of seventeen,
he has had his first pollutions; his sexual sensibility is normal.&#8221;</p>

points of view. In the same way, Hans Freimark neglects them (&#8220;The Meaning
of Uranism,&#8221; p. 14; Leipzig, 1906); he regards homosexuality as a transition
to a state in which &#8220;mankind will no longer need gross material contact for
purposes of reproduction.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<p class="noindent">The dispute whether homosexuality is a congenital or an acquired
phenomenon was one hitherto impossible to settle, because the
whole province of those homosexual manifestations for which I
suggest the name of &#8220;<b>pseudo-homosexuality</b>&#8221; had not been
separated with sufficient clearness from true homosexuality for
the essential difference between the two classes to receive accurate
expression. True homosexuality is congenital. It is an original,
<b>permanent, essential outflow</b> of the personality: pseudo-homosexuality,
on the contrary, is either a homosexual sensibility
suggested from without, transient, and not associated with the
essence of the personality; or else it is merely <b>apparent</b> homosexuality,
the illusion being dependent upon hermaphroditism
or upon some other physical or mental abnormality.</p>

<p>The pseudo-homosexuality of the former category is explicable
only by means of the fact of &#8220;<b>bisexuality</b>,&#8221; the existence of which
has been scientifically proved only within recent years. By
bisexuality we understand the possibility of two distinct modes
of sexual perception occurring in one and the same person; and
this, again, finds its explanation in the bisexual germinal vestiges
which exist in every individual. There remains in every man a
vestige of woman, in every woman a vestige of man, in a sense
in a state of potential energy, which, however, is capable, by the
action of various external influences, of being transformed into
kinetic energy; but this vestige <b>always</b> plays a small part in comparison
with the true specific sexual nature. This bisexuality
was discussed in an earlier chapter of this book (<a href="#Page39">pp. 39</a>, <a href="#Page40">40</a> and
<a href="#Page70">70</a>, <a href="#Page71">71</a>), and was there characterized as a phenomenon secondary
in every respect, to which no great importance could be attached.
The idea of bisexuality is not new; neither Fliess nor Weininger
was its discoverer. It was already known to the
<span class="nowrap">ancients.<a id="FNanchor567"></a><a href="#Footnote567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></span>
Heinse, in &#8220;Ardinghello,&#8221; gives expression to the idea in almost
the same words as Weininger (see <a href="#Page40">p. 40</a>). Recently Magnus
<span class="nowrap">Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor568"></a><a href="#Footnote568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></span>
has collected the historical and literary details of the
subject of bisexuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page540">[540]</span></p>

<p>Bisexuality manifests itself more especially at the period of
puberty, during the time of obscure yearnings and impulses&mdash;the
so-called indifferent period which precedes the awakening of the
sexual impulse. Physical bisexuality, therefore, often enough
corresponds to psychical bisexuality. In the boy there is a
trace of girlishness, in the girl a trace of boyishness; we have the
two types of the dreamy youth and of the tomboy. Then there
readily arise delicate inclinations between individuals of like
sexes, especially as the result of continuous companionship, so
that an obscure impulse of transient homosexual perception
manifests itself between two boys, or between two girls, of the
same age; or, again, this transient homosexuality may take the
form of a worshipful admiration of an older person of the same
sex. Gutzkow distinguished these two forms of pseudo-homosexuality,
of which he had had experience in his own person.
In his &#8220;Secular Pictures,&#8221; vol. i., pp. 50, 51 (Frankfort, 1856),
he remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The feeling of love originates in most feminine natures, not from
the quiet consideration of the secrets of love, but from a magnetic
attraction towards other individuals, whom they regard as being
better and more beautiful than themselves. Commonly the love for a
man is preceded by an often illimitable love for a woman. Young girls
fall in love with older girls&mdash;a phenomenon which often occurs also in
boys, as I myself experienced when a boy, feeling the most ardent
passion for one of my comrades, who now is extremely disagreeable
to me.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A similar explanation suffices for the transient tender love
exhibited by Grillparzer towards Altm&uuml;ller (<i>cf.</i> Grillparzer&#8217;s
&#8220;Diary,&#8221; edition of Glossy and Sauer, pp. 24-26; Stuttgart).
In boarding-schools, barracks, and training-schools we often
find these pseudo-homosexual liaisons. The prison is said by
Parent-Duchatelet to be a high-school of tribadism. He and
other French authors report the epidemic diffusion of homosexual
practices in prisons for women. Whenever homosexuality
appears <b>suddenly</b> in an epidemic manner, <b>affecting large numbers
of individuals</b>, we have to do, not with genuine original uranism,
but with pseudo-homosexuality. As regards boarding-schools,
which exhibit a lascivious environment extremely open to manifestations
of this kind, Hans von Kahlenberg, in his &#8220;Nixchen,&#8221;
p. 41 (Vienna, 1904), has vividly described the matter.</p>

<p>Youthful bisexuality is to be found in slighter forms in almost
every human being, but it is a typical phenomenon of puberty,
and disappears with the passing of this epoch, to make room for<span class="pagenum" id="Page541">[541]</span>
the completely developed heterosexuality of the adult. There
occurs also in homosexuals, in whom homosexual sensibility first
makes itself definitely manifest after puberty, a quite analogous
inclination to the other sex before and during puberty. Thus, a
typical homosexual twenty-three years of age, who now exhibits
<i>horror femin&aelig;</i>, related to me that at the age of sixteen or seventeen
years he was very fond of girls, and pursued them a great deal, but
without definite sexual desire. This transient obscure attraction
of homosexuals towards the other sex is a kind of &#8220;pseudo-heterosexuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes bisexuality will continue after the period of puberty,
and in exceptional cases will persist throughout life. According
to Hirschfeld, this occurs especially in men of genius, and in
those inclined to become priests or schoolmasters. But in
most cases even then one or other impulsive tendency&mdash;the
heterosexual or the homosexual&mdash;is predominant. These individuals
have been called &#8220;psychical hermaphrodites&#8221; (von
Krafft-Ebing). These bisexual varieties may manifest themselves
in very various ways, in most cases gynandry or androgyny
is purely spiritual, and finds expression only in association with
particular tendencies, especially <b>fetichistic</b> tendencies. The two
following very remarkable cases throw a clear light on this
peculiar form of bisexuality. We may as well accept for the
more or less specific form of bisexuality described in these cases
the suggested name of &#8220;junores.&#8221;</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1.The case of a psychical hermaphrodite:</p>

<p>N. N., an American journalist, thirty-three years of age, writes:
&#8220;From earliest youth I had an impulse to appear dressed in women&#8217;s
clothing, and whenever I had an opportunity I had elegant body linen
made for me, silken chemises, and whatever was the fashion. Even
as a boy I used to borrow my sister&#8217;s clothing and wear it secretly.
Only later, after my mother&#8217;s death, was I able to give free rein to
my wishes, and I came into the possession of a wardrobe resembling
that of the most elegant lady of fashion. Although compelled in the
daytime to appear as a man, still I wear, under these clothes, a complete
outfit of women&#8217;s underclothing&mdash;stays, open-work stockings,
and everything proper to a woman, a bracelet also, and patent-leather
women&#8217;s boots, with elegant high heels. When the evening
comes, I breathe more freely. Then I can throw off the burdensome
mask, and feel wholly woman. Wrapped in a tea-gown of an elegant
cut, and wearing the finest underclothing, I am able to occupy myself
in my favourite employments, among which may be mentioned the
study of the primitive history of mankind, or I give myself up to some
routine duties. A feeling of repose takes possession of me, such as is
impossible during the day, when I have to wear men&#8217;s clothing.
Although fully woman, I do not feel any need to give myself to a man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page542">[542]</span>
I feel flattered, certainly, if, when appearing in women&#8217;s dress, I please
others, but I have no definite sexual desire towards my own sex. It
may be that I have not yet discovered my <i>alter ego</i>. Notwithstanding
all my well-developed feminine customs, I married, and am the
father of a powerful, beautiful girl, who exhibits no tendencies whatever
resembling mine. My wife, an energetic, cultured lady, was
fully aware of my passion, but hoped in the course of time to wean me
from it. In this, however, she was not successful. I performed my
marital duties, but I gave myself up all the more to my customs. My
wife obtained a separation, and at the time at which I now write she
is intimate with another man, and is pregnant. My physique is
thoroughly masculine, with the exception of the pelvis and of the
calves of the legs, which are feminine in form. Summary: Outward
appearance masculine. When wearing women&#8217;s dress I have completely
the corresponding figure&mdash;waist, 20 inches; chest measurement,
34 inches; height, 176 centimetres (5 feet 9 inches); weight 125 pounds.
Hands long and narrow, sensibility feminine. When wearing men&#8217;s
clothing I feel a certain uneasiness. When I see an elegant lady or
actress, I think how well I should appear in her dress. I have an
abundance of earrings, pearls, lace scarves, and similar articles of
adornment, and at a dance I give myself up to the idea of how delightful
it would be to appear in women&#8217;s dress. If it were possible, I should
completely abandon men&#8217;s clothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. &#8220;At about the age of fifteen and a half years I began to take an
interest in women&#8217;s dress. I felt an inward impulse, which drove me
to the windows of the shops displaying articles of women&#8217;s dress&mdash;corsets,
etc. In shoemakers&#8217; windows it was the women&#8217;s boots and
shoes which attracted my attention rather than the men&#8217;s. The same
was the case with dress fabrics, among which self-coloured materials
for women&#8217;s dress pleased me best. Beautiful blue stuffs (satin)
especially attracted me; also, I had an ardent love for blue velvet.
As time passed, I felt a desire to possess such things, and to wear
them. But since at home I had no means to spend in this way, whilst
the desire sometimes was so violent as to give me no rest, I endeavoured
to resist it with all the religious and rational grounds I could call to
mind; yet this was of little help to me, for whenever I met a woman
clothed to my taste, the longing was immediately reawakened. If I
met a woman whose appearance aroused this desire (which henceforth
I will call my &#8216;costume-stimulus&#8217;), I looked round, in order to overcome
this costume-stimulus, to try to find a woman who displeased
me. Within me there raged a conflict (which at that time was obscure
even to myself) between the masculine nature and the feminine. One
day the feminine in me gained the victory, as it impelled me (when
my parents were absent from the house) to try on some of my sisters&#8217;
clothes; but as soon as I had put on the corset I had an erection,
immediately followed by an ejaculation of semen. This gave me no
gratification; on the contrary, I was very angry that putting on the
corset should have given rise to an ejaculation of semen. At varying
intervals I repeated this attempt to dress myself as a woman, and in
doing so always endeavoured to avoid anything that could give rise
to an erection. Gradually I succeeded in this matter of dressing;
but I was now consumed also with the desire for caressing a feminine
being, and therefore the dressing alone failed to satisfy me. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page543">[543]</span>
this dressing-up also failed to give me real pleasure, because I did not
possess any costume which really suited me; but still, apart from
sexual excitement, it produced a feeling of well-being. After I had
dressed up as a woman, my imagination always busied itself with the
idea of how beautiful it would be if I had a beloved before whom I
might display myself unrestrainedly, just as I then was. In these
fancies I always pictured to myself a girl of my own age, with long
hair and well-developed breasts and hips. This imagination generally
resulted in a pollution, which I sometimes endeavoured to prevent by
taking off the articles of clothing as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;By a colleague I was initiated into the practice of masturbation.
He explained to me that if I had no woman who would give herself
to me, I was in a position to satisfy myself. The first time I resisted
the impulse; but the costume-stimulus tormented me, and I had
discovered that after a seminal emission I was at peace for a time;
moreover, when dressing up, I was always exposed to the danger of
being discovered, and so I began the practice of self-abuse. Masturbation
did not give me proper gratification, and therefore, after practising
it, I always experienced a great feeling of regret and also a
feeling of exhaustion; moreover, it did not produce the feeling of
well-being which resulted from dressing up as a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was shy, and was very readily embarrassed in the presence of
the female sex; I therefore avoided seeing much of women; I avoided
it, also, on account of my costume-stimulus. It would have been
preferable to me if, physically, Nature had made me a woman, so that
I could have gone about freely among girls of my own age. For the
reasons already given I did not learn to dance; moreover, the turning
round made me very giddy, and from the age of seventeen and a half
to nineteen years I suffered from attacks of syncope. At about the
age of twenty-two years I fell in love with my present wife, who
attracted me on account of her grace, her figure, and her character. My
wife was even more bashful than myself. My inclination drew me
towards her, but on account of my costume-stimulus, I avoided being
alone with her. From now onwards I began to consider what I could
possibly do in order to explain to my betrothed my true nature, but
all the attempts which I made were failures. After six months&#8217; engagement,
I left the place where my betrothed was living. The engagement
lasted seven years before we were married. The principal reason for
the delay was that we were both impecunious. When I was alone
with my betrothed, I was always thinking of my costume-stimulus.
Shortly before we were married I told my betrothed in a letter of my
peculiar tendency, for I felt it was my duty to do so. She could not
understand how I could find pleasure in dressing myself up as a
woman. At first she was indifferent regarding my costume-stimulus;
later she thought it was morbid, an impulse bordering on the insane.
I often had to call my imagination to my help in order to produce an
erection. My marriage became more unhappy year by year. My
wife, on account of my morbid tendency, suspected me of all possible
perversities, and was of opinion that an individual predisposed as I
was could not be capable of true, upright love for a woman. How I
was to get woman&#8217;s clothing to my taste I did not know. In my
marriage I was no better off as regards the costume-stimulus, but
rather worse. I had more sleepless nights on account of this costume-stimulus<span class="pagenum" id="Page544">[544]</span>
than I had had before I married. As time passed, I became
continually more ill-humoured, and was occasionally cross to my wife,
which afterwards made me very sorry. In the sleepless nights I
puzzled how I could possibly manage that my wife should not concern
herself any more about the costume-stimulus, and how I could possibly
fulfil my wishes in this respect. Gradually I succeeded in winning my
wife to my side to this extent, that she agreed to make a costume for
me, but I must not have many such.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife was always looking for a reason. She believed that
dressing up must have some cause, or must produce in me some effect,
which I was unwilling to tell her. She was continually tormenting
me about this; she would not believe that I spoke the truth, and she
no longer felt any confidence in me. She believed that every one
must perceive that I had this morbid impulse. She endeavoured to
learn something about the matter from other women. Those whom
she asked could only tell her evil and common things about men with
tendencies like mine; some said I must be unconditionally an urning;
others that I must have intercourse with other women behind my
wife&#8217;s back; others that I wanted to lay aside men&#8217;s clothing in order
to please girls under age, and so on. I suffered horribly from these
false accusations.</p>

<p>&#8220;I endeavoured once again, in an essay I composed, which I entitled
&#8216;The Junores,&#8217; to make the matter clear to my wife. By junores I
indicated men who wished to assume, or who did assume, the outward
appearance of women in the matter of clothing, demeanour, and
figure, but who sexually were masculine. All this was of no help to
me. Our life together became continually more unbearable with the
lapse of time; often there were scenes which had the most depressing
effect on my mind. After violent scenes there occurred in me nocturnal
pollutions, accompanied by no sensation of pleasure; also after these
scenes erections were for a long time incomplete, so that a kind of
impotence ensued.</p>

<p>&#8220;After every new accusation which my wife made against me I
avoided going home in the evening. I wandered for hours in by-streets,
overwhelmed by a feeling of futility and vacuity; my nerves
all vibrated; sometimes I could not keep my limbs still. If I had had
no children, or if I had known that they would be properly cared for, I
should have known what to do in such a mood. One thing still torments
me. Will my children be hereditarily tainted?&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>I have myself seen both of these cases. The men concerned
appear somewhat nervous, but they are otherwise quite healthy
and manly, and both deny that they feel any sexual inclination
towards men. The desire to wear women&#8217;s clothing,
and to feel as a woman, may also make its appearance as a
<b>morbid</b> phenomenon later in life, in the form of the &#8220;delusion of
sexual metamorphosis&#8221; (<i>metamorphosis sexualis paranoica</i>); or it
may be <b>artificially induced</b>, as among the ancient Scythians and
among the Mexican &#8220;mujerados.&#8221; These latter are selected as
men originally <b>most powerful</b>, and entirely free from any feminine
appearance, and by incessant riding on horseback and by excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page545">[545]</span>
masturbation they are made impotent (through atrophy of the
genital organs) and effeminate, so that there may even occur a
secondary development of the breasts (Hammond). All this
belongs to the category of pseudo-homosexuality.</p>

<p>With regard to numerous historical women-men and men-women&mdash;such
as, for example, the celebrated Chevalier d&#8217;Eon,
Mademoiselle de Maupin (immortalized by Gautier in the romance
of this name), and many other women going about in men&#8217;s
clothing, or men going about in women&#8217;s clothing&mdash;it is, as a
rule, no longer possible to determine whether they were genuinely
homosexual, pseudo-homosexual, or bisexual.</p>

<p>I regard, however, the interesting type of <b>effeminate Parisian
street-arab</b>, described by Brouardel at the Second Congress of
Criminal Anthropologists at Berlin in the year 1889, as characteristically
and originally homosexual.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;At the age from twelve to sixteen years the lad is still small,
grasps ideas very slowly, and has little will-power. At the time of
puberty he has experienced an inhibition of development, and his
bodily growth has remained stationary. The penis is thin and flaccid,
the testicles are small, the pubic hair is scanty, the skin is smooth, and
the beard is very thin; the skeleton does not develop fully, like that of
the normal male; the pelvis becomes wide, and the general outlines of
the body become rounded (<i>potel&eacute;es</i>) because there is an undoubted
deposit of fat in the subcutaneous tissues, so that the breasts also
become enlarged.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This state persists. Brouardel found it still present in individuals
of twenty-five to thirty years of age. These children of
great towns are characterized by intellectual sterility and by
incapacity for procreation. This type is found also among the
well-to-do middle classes, and from such, according to Brouardel,
the <i>d&eacute;cadents</i> are recruited, while the effeminate gamins either
become professional p&aelig;derasts, or undertake the preparation of
<i>articles de</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>Paris</i>.<a id="FNanchor569"></a><a href="#Footnote569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not difficult, in this description, to recognize true homosexuality.</p>

<p>Magnus Hirschfeld gives an account of a peculiar form of
pseudo-homosexuality occurring in an individual who in ordinary
life was <span class="nowrap">asexual.<a id="FNanchor570"></a><a href="#Footnote570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></span></p>

<p>The person concerned was an extremely effeminate and neurasthenic
member of a spiritualistic club, who in his normal
condition felt sensual attraction neither to woman nor to man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page546">[546]</span>
but who in the trance state felt himself to be an Indian woman,
and then became inspired with an ardent passion for one of his
fellow-members.</p>

<p>Also in chronic intoxications, especially in alcoholism, pseudo-homosexuality
may make its appearance, in some cases as an
enduring and in others as a transient condition.</p>

<p>An important category of pseudo-homosexuality is constituted
by persons in whom it arises owing to <b>insufficient opportunity
for sexual intercourse with members of the opposite sex</b>&mdash;as,
for example, in the absence of women on board ship, in monasteries,
in prisons for men, in the French foreign legion; and as
regards lack of men in nunneries, and in the case of unmarried
or unhappily married women, who supply a large contingent to
<span class="nowrap">pseudo-tribadism.<a id="FNanchor571"></a><a href="#Footnote571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></span>
An account of p&aelig;derasty in prisons is given
by Charles Perrier, &#8220;La P&eacute;d&eacute;rastie en Prison&#8221; (Lyons, 1900).</p>

<p>In this category we must also mention the &#8220;debauchee p&aelig;derasts&#8221;
for which <b>truly existent</b> kind of pseudo-homosexuals I
propose the name of &#8220;<b>anal masturbators</b>.&#8221; These are heterosexual
individuals in whom either primarily the anus plays the
part of an erogenic zone, or in whom this region becomes erogenic
in consequence of the exhaustion of all other varieties of sexual
stimulus. Hammond, von Schrenck-Notzing, and Taxil have
proved the existence of these anal masturbators and the frequent
occurrence in them of pseudo-homosexual
<span class="nowrap">tendencies.<a id="FNanchor572"></a><a href="#Footnote572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon is the <b>pseudo-homosexuality of
female prostitutes</b>. We certainly encounter among prostitutes a
number of genuine tribades, who owe their adoption of professional
prostitution to the existence of this original tendency to
homosexual love, because in their relations with men the heart
plays, and can play, no part (see above, <a href="#Page434">p. 434</a>). Prostitutes
who are heterosexual by nature may become homosexual for two
reasons: first, by intercourse with, and owing to the influence
of, truly Lesbian associates, in whom the inward sense of solidarity
possessed by all prostitutes is especially strong; in the
second place, in consequence of the antipathy to intercourse with
men, created by their experience of life, and striking always
deeper roots, for they learn to know man only in his brutal
sexual coarseness. The continuous compulsion to which they
are subjected to satisfy the animal sensuality of worn-out rou&eacute;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page547">[547]</span>
by the most disgusting procedures ultimately produces in them
the most unconquerable antipathy to the male sex, so that all the
delicate sensibility of which they are capable is directed towards
their own sex. The homosexual union appears to them, as
Eulenburg rightly points out (&#8220;Sexual Neuropathy,&#8221; pp. 143, 144),
to be something &#8220;higher, purer, and comparatively blameless.&#8221;
They regard it in a more ideal light than sexual intercourse
with men. Women owners of brothels also favour tribadistic
love, because thereby they safeguard the prostitutes in their
houses from the influence of
<span class="nowrap"><i>souteneurs</i>.<a id="FNanchor573"></a><a href="#Footnote573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></span></p>

<p>As J. de Vaud&egrave;re describes in his &#8220;Demi-Sexes,&#8221; pseudo-tribadism
is especially diffused in Paris as a fashionable practice,
and manifests itself here in the form described by
<span class="nowrap">Martineau,<a id="FNanchor574"></a><a href="#Footnote574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></span>
of a <b>temporary</b> homosexuality, which is subserved by an extensive
prostitution, and which clearly exhibits its pseudo-homosexual
characteristics by its intermittent appearance in the form of
spiritual epidemics.</p>

<p>Unquestionably we have to do with pseudo-homosexuality
also in all those cases in which homosexual love makes its appearance
as a <b>national custom</b> among a percentage widely exceeding
the usual percentage of ordinary homosexuality. The typical
example of this kind is <b>the love of boys of ancient Greece</b>&mdash;&#8220;p&aelig;derasty,&#8221;
in the better sense of the word. Since in this work
I am discussing the sexual life of the present day, I do not propose
here to deal at length with this interesting topic, and must refer
the reader to the second volume (in course of preparation) of my
work on &#8220;The Origin of Syphilis,&#8221; in which I have discussed the
subject at considerable length.</p>

<p>Since the Hellenic love of boys was a widely diffused custom,
the origin of which may be directly referred to Crete, indirectly
to the Orient, it is evident that only a fraction of the p&aelig;derasts
can have been true homosexuals. The majority were pseudo-homosexuals.
It is possible that the custom was first introduced
by original homosexuals, and also that it was subsequently maintained
by these. But soon it became a general practice for a
man to regard his wife simply as a &#8220;procreative machine,&#8221; and
to seek for true <b>spiritual</b> love from a youth. Since to the men
of antiquity woman had no soul and no individuality, <b>the love
of boys appeared to them something natural and morally justifiable</b>.
It would, however, be completely unnatural if for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page548">[548]</span>
heterosexual community of our own time we wished to reintroduce
the antique love of boys, since we modern men have
learned that woman also has a <b>soul</b>; that she also has the same
justification as man for the development of her human nature;
that she can be, and ought to be, the object of individual, spiritual,
profound love. I rejoice, that those who are fighting for the
rights of the genuine congenital homosexuals, that men like
Magnus Hirschfeld, Numa Pr&aelig;torius, and other investigators,
have recently expressed themselves in energetic terms as opposed
to those whose aim is a sort of propaganda for the diffusion of
the love of men among heterosexuals&mdash;whose endeavour it is,
in fact, to introduce a formal cult of uranism. This movement
can do nothing but harm to the just cause of homosexuals.</p>

<p>No one can prize more highly than I do myself a <b>noble friendship</b>
between men, which at the present day is far too little
<span class="nowrap">practised;<a id="FNanchor575"></a><a href="#Footnote575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></span>
no one can wish more heartily than I do that men could
speak to one another of love, without being exposed to the
suspicion of <span class="nowrap">homosexuality.<a id="FNanchor576"></a><a href="#Footnote576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></span>
In a certain sense I am in thorough
agreement with the beautiful demonstrations of Heinrich Schurtz
and Benedict Friedl&auml;nder on masculine friendship as a normal
fundamental impulse of humanity and as the foundation of social
<span class="nowrap">intercourse.<a id="FNanchor577"></a><a href="#Footnote577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></span>
But this friendship between heterosexual men,
based upon natural sympathy and community of occupation, has
<b>not the least sexual admixture</b>, whereas only in the beautiful
dialogues of Plato can the Greek love of boys, which some advocate
at the present day, be ascribed to the spiritual
<span class="nowrap">Eros.<a id="FNanchor578"></a><a href="#Footnote578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></span>
In<span class="pagenum" id="Page549">[549]</span>
reality, however, the Greek love of boys degenerated into the
grossest sensuality, since the youth stimulated sexual desire like
a woman, and was used as <span class="nowrap">such,<a id="FNanchor579"></a><a href="#Footnote579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></span>
so that the originally ideal
character of the relationship disappeared.</p>

<p>In the <b>Oriental</b> love of
<span class="nowrap">boys<a id="FNanchor580"></a><a href="#Footnote580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></span> this ideal element was probably
never present, and sensual relationships played the principal
part from the very first. The boys&#8217; brothels of the Mohammedan
East were visited by heterosexual men just as much as by homosexuals.
The same men derived pleasure from intercourse both
with women and with boys. Bisexuality was in this case put
into practice as a matter of course.</p>

<p>German civilization also passed through an epoch in which
bisexual activities of feeling were clearly manifest in both
sexes, without, however, leading at any time to the physical
practice of pseudo-homosexuality. This remarkable period was
the time of transition between the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sturm und Drang&#8221; had quieted down; its fiercely active
forces had been controlled; its vigorous will had been pacified,
and guided in concrete directions; its kinetic energy had in a
sense become potential in two new formative and emotional
tendencies of the time, which progressed side by side, and, notwithstanding
all the differences between them, influenced one
another mutually to a considerable extent&mdash;classicism and
romanticism. Classicism, under the stimulating influence of
Winckelmann, looked back to the &#8220;noble simplicity and quiet
greatness&#8221; of the antique, to the beauty exhibited simply in
<b>form</b>, whose wonder Goethe more than any other has made
manifest to us. Romanticism, on the other hand, was the term
employed to indicate the boundless enlargement and increasing
profundity of the emotional life, of which the <b>formless</b> is especially
characteristic. This appears most clearly in the work of Novalis,
Tieck, and Wackenroder; but both tendencies meet in the
sphere of the sexual. I need only mention the name of Winckelmann
to indicate how markedly the purely &aelig;sthetic
<span class="nowrap">contemplation,<a id="FNanchor581"></a><a href="#Footnote581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></span><span
class="pagenum" id="Page550">[550]</span>
and the purely &aelig;sthetic enjoyment, of the beautiful human
form must have favoured the development of homosexual modes
of perception. We may in this connexion speak of the &#8220;Greek
Renascence.&#8221; On the other hand, the romantic mood, the
deepening of the individual life of feeling, the eternal searching
for new, peculiar sensations, was very apt to awaken those
activities of feeling slumbering so deeply beneath the threshold
of consciousness, which we to-day denote by the term &#8220;bisexuality.&#8221;
In Friedrich Schlegel&#8217;s &#8220;Lucinde,&#8221; for example, we find
frequent allusions to this bisexual mode of perception, as in the
place in which he speaks of a confusion of the masculine and
feminine r&ocirc;les in the love contest. When, in so much of the
published &#8220;Correspondence&#8221; of this period, kisses, embraces,
caresses, and tendernesses between two men or two women
appear to fly to and fro, it may be that this is neither to be regarded
as purely homosexual perception, nor as a simply conventional
contemporary custom, but rather as the very characteristic
expression of a tendency to bisexual imaginations and
dreams induced by the hypertension, overdriving, and artificial
increase, of the emotional life. Thus only, for example, can we
explain the passionate profusion of tenderness which appears in
many of the letters of Jean Paul, written by him to men; for
Jean Paul was unquestionably
<span class="nowrap">heterosexual.<a id="FNanchor582"></a><a href="#Footnote582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>The same is true of the women of this time. According to
Welcker, the friendships of the women of the romantic period
exhibited this character of a Platonic love. Since the dominion
of romanticism &#8220;influenced emotional young men in very
various ways, in more than one morally strict circle, two women
friends were so inseparable and so indispensable to one another
that those round them used sometimes to laugh at this amativeness,
of which, however, a serious suspicion was
<span class="nowrap">impossible.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor583"></a><a href="#Footnote583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting proof of the existence of pseudo-homosexuality<span class="pagenum" id="Page551">[551]</span>
among the women of that time is afforded by a
<span class="nowrap">passage<a id="FNanchor584"></a><a href="#Footnote584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></span> from a
romance by Ernst Wagner (1760-1812), one of the scholars of
Jean Paul. The book is entitled &#8220;Isidora,&#8221; and in it the Lesbian
love-scene between the Princess Isidora and her friend Olympia
is very plainly described, although both of them at the same time
are passionately in love with men.</p>

<p>The last and not unimportant phenomenal form of pseudo-homosexuality
is <b>hermaphroditism</b>. It is a remarkable fact that
only in recent years has science attempted a serious study of
hermaphroditic states, which previously, as
<span class="nowrap">Blumreich<a id="FNanchor585"></a><a href="#Footnote585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></span> points
out, were to a large extent ignored, both as regards their social
importance and their frequency. It was the great service of
<span class="nowrap">Neugebauer<a id="FNanchor586"></a><a href="#Footnote586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></span>
and Magnus <span class="nowrap">Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor587"></a><a href="#Footnote587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></span>
that they drew general
attention to these remarkable sexual intermediate stages, and
proved their eminent practical importance, which had previously
been suspected by no one. How completely the matter had been
ignored is proved by the remarkable fact that the new Civil Code
for the German Empire completely ignores the juridical determinations
of the former Prussian Civil Code regarding hermaphrodites,
alleging that there existed no persons whose sex was
indeterminate or indeterminable!</p>

<p>The so-called &#8220;<b>true hermaphroditism</b>&#8221;&mdash;the condition in which
male and female reproductive glands (testicles and ovaries) are
met with <b>in a single individual</b>&mdash;is one of the greatest rarities.
By the investigations of Salen (1899), Garr&eacute;-Simon (1903), and
Ludwig Pick (1905), the existence of such individuals with mixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page552">[552]</span>
reproductive glands (&#8220;ovotestes&#8221;) has been proved as an actual
fact. Walter Simon, in the one hundred and seventy-second
volume of <i>Virchow&#8217;s Archives</i>, has described the rare case of
true hermaphroditism observed by Garr&eacute;. In a person twenty-one
years of age, brought up as a man, and having thoroughly masculine
feelings, there suddenly occurred, associated with swelling
of the breasts (gynecomasty), monthly recurring h&aelig;morrhages,
proceeding from the supposed intertesticular fissure; also from
time to time, associated with voluptuous erection of the penis,
there was discharged whitish mucus, and the libidinous ideas
connected with this discharge referred always to women. The
physical structure and facial expression of this individual were
feminine; the build of the thorax, the shoulders, and the shape
of the arms exhibited male characteristics. In a right-sided
swelling, resembling an inguinal hernia, were found a testicle-ovary
(Ger. <i>Hodeneierstock</i>), an epididymis, a parovarium, a
spermatic cord, and a Fallopian tube.</p>

<p>More frequent than these cases, in which naturally the determination
of sex is practically impossible, are cases of <b>pseudo-hermaphroditism</b>,
which also possess the greatest importance in
connexion with the problem of pseudo-homosexuality. In these
cases of pseudo-hermaphroditism the reproductive glands are,
in fact, distinctively male or female, but the characteristics of
the <b>excretory organs</b> and of the <b>external genital organs</b> do not
enable us to determine the sex, for they are in part male, in part
female, and in part completely undifferentiated, which is to be
explained as dependent upon an incomplete or entirely wanting
differentiation of the primitively identical rudiment of the external
genital organs of the two sexes (inhibition of the processes
of growth at some stage of development). Thus there
arises <i>pseudo-hermaphroditismus masculinus</i>, in cases in which
the genital fissure is not completely closed, so that the urethra
possesses a fissure below (hypospadias); also the two halves of
the scrotum may fail to join, so that a fissure is left between them,
simulating a vaginal inlet. Since in these cases the testicles are
commonly retained within the abdominal cavity, or else appear
in the inguinal region, simulating an inguinal hernia, the penis
is believed to be a kind of enlarged clitoris, and the individual
is mistaken for a woman (<i>erreur de sexe</i>). If it further happens
that, on account of the supposed inguinal hernia, the individual
is ordered to wear, and continues to wear, a truss, the testicular
tissue disappears completely as a result of pressure atrophy, and
the correct diagnosis becomes more difficult than ever. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page553">[553]</span>
recently saw a case of this kind in a male hermaphrodite, twenty-two
years of age, who had been brought up as a woman. He had,
however, always felt attraction towards women, and, having a
large membrum, he was able, notwithstanding the existence of
hypospadias, to complete regular coitus. In the ejaculated
semen the examining physician had <b>not found any spermatozoa</b>;
but in this case the testicles had doubtless atrophied in consequence
of the wearing of a truss. This pseudo-hermaphrodite
has recently published the history of his upbringing as a
&#8220;woman.&#8221; The work is of great interest from the psychological
point of view, and is entitled &#8220;A Man&#8217;s Years as a Girl,&#8221; by
&#8220;Nobody&#8221; (Berlin, 1907).</p>

<p>Where the reproductive glands are female there results a
<i>pseudo-hermaphroditismus femininus</i> in cases in which the
external genital organs of this female pseudo-hermaphrodite
exhibit a certain similarity with the genital organs of the male&mdash;for
example, when the clitoris is exceptionally large, and the
labia majora have grown together, so that the vaginal inlet
appears to be wanting. In this case also there may be a mistake
in diagnosis, and, consequently, the individual having been
educated as a man, apparent homosexuality may result when the
natural sexual inclination towards the male manifests itself in
due course.</p>

<p>In both varieties of pseudo-hermaphroditism there exist very
various anatomical and physiological possibilities in respect of
the relationship of the secondary sexual characters to the anatomical
character of the reproductive glands, in respect of the
menstrual equivalents in male pseudo-hermaphrodites, in respect
of the relationship of the sexual impulse to the reproductive
glands, in respect of the greater or less strength of the impulse,
in respect of periodic genital h&aelig;morrhages in male pseudo-hermaphrodites,
in respect of possible sexual aberrations, etc.
For more exact details I must refer the reader to the works of
Neugebauer and Hirschfeld. Here I will only refer to a case
described by the last-named author, of a male pseudo-hermaphrodite,
forty years of age, Friderike S., who had been brought
up as a &#8220;woman,&#8221; who at a very early age had exhibited an
inclination towards women <b>only</b>, and an antipathy to sexual
intercourse with men. In this individual a reproductive gland
resembling a testicle could be detected, out of which there issued
a structure resembling the spermatic cord. In the left inguinal
canal was an atrophied reproductive gland of indeterminate
character. The membrum was something between penis and<span class="pagenum" id="Page554">[554]</span>
clitoris. The labia majora and minora bounded a short c&aelig;cal
vagina. Internal female reproductive organs could not be
detected. On the other hand, there appeared to be a prostate
gland. In the sexual secretion, which was discharged by a
different opening from the urine, H. Friedenthal <b>was able to
detect very numerous completely normal spermatozoa</b>, whereby
the male character of this pseudo-woman was completely proved,
and whereby also the alleged &#8220;homosexual&#8221; tendencies were
now shown to be heterosexual.</p>

Karl Gutzkow writes in a beautiful letter to Max Ring: &#8220;Our time is so
separative, our hearts beat in so solitary a manner, and yet the need of intimate
bonds is there, but who dares to tie them? Any intimate friendship formed
between men in early youth disappears like dust before the wind. Then comes
the love of woman, which fills the whole of our heart; then follows the care for
material existence, which increases our egoism; and the danger that our heart
will shrink makes its appearance all too soon. Who draws near to another
human being? Who admits that he has need of others, and that his life is a life
without love? We all suffer in this way; we should form warm friendships
between man and man&#8221; (&#8220;Berlin in the Time of Reaction,&#8221; reminiscences by
Max Ring, published in <i>Deutsche Dichtung</i>, 1898, vol. xxiii., pp. 51, 52).</p>

This connexion was recognized, although in the inverse direction, by
Heinrich Laube. In a passage of &#8220;Junge Europa&#8221; (vol. i., p. 72 of the new
edition; Vienna, 1876) we read: &#8220;Constantia is the most beautiful woman I have
ever seen. Outline, muscles, figure, eyes, speech, mind, feeling&mdash;everything in
her is beautiful; she is the ideal of a man found in the feminine form. I love
this power in woman above everything; the soft, the non-resisting, does not offer
me enough opposition. <i>Perhaps such women as these form the transition to the
Hellenic love of boys.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><a id="Footnote581"></a><a href="#FNanchor581"><span class="label">[581]</span></a>
Goethe confirms this in a conversation with Chancellor von M&uuml;ller, in which
he deduces the &#8220;aberration&#8221; of Greek love from this, &#8220;that, according to his own
&aelig;sthetic judgment, man has always been more beautiful, more perfect, more
complete, than woman. Such a feeling, when it has once originated, easily passes
over into the animal and the grossly material.&#8221; <i>Cf.</i> <i>Annual for Sexual Intermediate

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<p class="noindent">The homosexual and pseudo-homosexual phenomena described
in the preceding chapters constitute a far from universal variety
of sexual impulse, but &#8220;<b>algolagnia</b>&#8221; is much commoner. This
name was introduced by Schrenck-Notzing as a general term for
the phenomena of <b>sadism</b> and <b>masochism</b>, since these two sexual
aberrations are closely related one to the other.</p>

<p>Algolagnia, or painful lasciviousness, if we exclude from consideration
its most extreme manifestations, such as lust-murder
and suicide from lust, belongs unquestionably to the most widely
diffused of sexual aberrations; indeed, in its slighter forms it is
almost universal. An experienced woman told Havelock
<span class="nowrap">Ellis<a id="FNanchor588"></a><a href="#Footnote588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></span>
that she had known only one single man who was entirely free
from sadistic lust; and, on the other hand, there are few women
in whose sexuality no algolagnistic phenomena are demonstrable.
This is natural, for algolagnia, differing in this respect from other
sexual aberrations, has the <b>deepest biological roots</b>. Its nucleus,
<b>pleasure in the pain of others or in one&#8217;s own pain</b> (the term &#8220;pain&#8221;
being here used in the very widest significance, both physical
and mental), is an elementary phenomenon of amatory activity.
&#8220;Love is in its very nature pain,&#8221; we read in the &#8220;Divan&#8221; of
the Persian poet R&ucirc;mi. It is certain that we have here to do with
an anthropological phenomenon, one that is normal within wide
limits. Algolagnia plays the greatest r&ocirc;le in the individual life
of single human beings and in the civilized life of humanity at
large. It enables us to get a view into the hidden depths of the
human spirit, and displays to us the remarkable phenomenon of
the association of primeval animal instincts with the highest
spirituality. It at the same time debases love, and renders it
more profound, and it touches the most secret aspects of our
nature.</p>

<p class="noindent">sings Joseph Lauff in his &#8220;Geisslerin&#8221; (Cologne, 1901). Is there
any pleasure without pain? is there any love without sorrow?
He who is familiar with the history of civilization will answer these
questions in the negative. Pain is a civilizing factor of the first
rank; it is the necessary pre-condition and the inevitable accompaniment
of pleasure and the affirmation of life. This is the
central idea of the philosophy of Nietzsche. The pain of love is
only a special case of the great immeasurable <i>Weltschmerz</i> and
<i>Weltlust</i> (world-pain and world-joy), which move us so deeply
in the powerful descriptions of Schopenhauer, and have always
been the most lofty objects of contemplation to philosophers
and to students of <span class="nowrap">civilization.<a id="FNanchor589"></a><a href="#Footnote589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></span></p>

<p>That love-pleasure and love-pain, the forces of creation and
destruction&mdash;yes, indeed, that love and death (which Leopardi
in a wonderful poem celebrated as twin brothers)&mdash;are separated
only by a &#8220;thin veil&#8221; (Havelock Ellis), was an idea first expressed
in the celebrated work of the formidable Marquis de
<span class="nowrap">Sade,<a id="FNanchor590"></a><a href="#Footnote590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></span>
whose books, taken as a whole, are merely a paraphrase of the
idea of the connexion between pain and voluptuousness; and,
moreover, de Sade does not recognize this connexion only in active
algolagnia&mdash;that is, in the <b>infliction of pain</b>, the voluptuousness
of cruelty, the so-called &#8220;sadism&#8221;&mdash;but he recognizes it equally
in passive algolagnia, in the <b>suffering of pain</b>, the voluptuousness
of being tortured, in the state named after the author Sacher-Masoch,
&#8220;masochism.&#8221; De Sade, who was the first consistent
advocate of the anthropologico-ethnological theory of psychopathia
sexualis, himself collected almost all the facts regarding
the biological roots of painful lasciviousness, and regarding
algolagnistic phenomena in ethnology and in the history of
civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page559">[559]</span></p>

<p>The foundation for the understanding of active and passive
algolagnia is constituted by the fact that we have here, in the first
place, to do with a <b>purely biological</b> phenomenon, which makes
its appearance in every normal love. The sexual act exhibits
to us pain and pleasure in an indissoluble association. Love&#8217;s
embrace is a &#8220;sweet pain,&#8221; a painful
<span class="nowrap">pleasure.<a id="FNanchor591"></a><a href="#Footnote591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></span></p>

<p>The nature of the sense of voluptuousness is still rather obscure,
but it is certain that painful sensations make their appearance
as its accompaniment, probably indeed as an actual part of
voluptuousness. I may remind the reader of the interesting
remarks of Edmund Forster, mentioned on <a href="#Page44">p. 44</a>, regarding the
conception of sexual tension as a stimulation of the pain-perceiving
nerves of the genital organs. Still more clearly is pain
reflected (pain both active and passive) in the love-embrace itself,
in the <span class="nowrap">phenomena<a id="FNanchor592"></a><a href="#Footnote592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></span>
which we previously (<a href="#Page50">pp. 50</a>-<a href="#Page51">51</a>) described, such
as fierce embraces, convulsive seizures, grinding of the teeth,
screaming and biting, both on the part of the man and on the
part of the woman. Lucretius (&#8220;De Rerum Natura,&#8221; iv., verses
1054-1061) gave a vivid description of the normal sadistic and
masochistic accompaniments of coitus. In this association
sadism certainly predominates on the part of the man, though
not exclusively; and, contrariwise, masochism predominates,
though not exclusively, on the part of the woman. The sadistic
&#8220;love-bites,&#8221; for example, are more frequently given by the
woman, especially among savage <span class="nowrap">races,<a id="FNanchor593"></a><a href="#Footnote593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></span>
but among the Slavonic
peoples it is the man rather who practises the &#8220;biting-kiss&#8221;
during the sexual <span class="nowrap">act.<a id="FNanchor594"></a><a href="#Footnote594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">writes Karl Beck in his &#8220;Stille Lieder.&#8221;</p>

<p>How closely these phenomena are connected with the ideas of
<b>blood</b> and <b>cruelty</b>, and how this connexion is favoured by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page560">[560]</span>
redness and the flow of blood during sexual excitement, are
matters previously discussed (<a href="#Page51">p. 51</a>); and in my &#8220;Contributions
to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis&#8221; (vol. ii., pp. 39-41)
I have considered the question at greater length. In the same
category must also be placed the sexually stimulating influence
of red colours.</p>

<p>In association with these algolagnistic manifestations, so long
as they remain within physiological bounds, we do not so much
see <b>actual</b> physical pain, the actual infliction of suffering or
cruelty, as the <b>idea</b> thereof, as mental pain; indeed, actual pain
is often not lustful, as such, but only in idea.
<span class="nowrap">Eulenburg,<a id="FNanchor595"></a><a href="#Footnote595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></span>
especially, has rightly drawn attention to this mental intensification
of algolagnia. Mental pain and tears give a wonderful depth
to love, increase passion, as Goethe describes in his &#8220;Stella.&#8221;
Love needs pain, in order to be perceived as love. Why?
Because pain is something new, a contrast to pleasure, whose
eternity would be unbearable. This is described very clearly in
the &#8220;Letters of Ninon de L&#8217;Enclos,&#8221; which, though apocryphal,
are not less psychologically interesting (German edition, pp. 220,
221; Berlin, 1906).</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Change in the spiritual state is important to the happiness of both
the lovers. And what could better provide this advantage than a
separation? Have you never experienced the sweetness of a tender
separation? The disquiet, the commiseration, the tears which accompany
the departing lover, are they not something most valuable
to a delicate, sensitive soul? Commonly, lovers regard separation
for a few days as an evil. But if they examined the nature of their
reputed pain a little more closely, they would soon perceive that this
pain does not make a purely disagreeable impression on the soul; on
the contrary, an entrancing joy lies hidden therein. The pain enfolds
a delightful charm; and we learn that the heart, however much it
may be moved with sympathy, always finds itself in an agreeable
mood as soon as it is able to exercise its sensibility.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Similarly, G. H. Schneider remarks (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 126, 127),
that in all love relationships there arises a need for becoming
aware of</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="noindent">&#8220;the contrast between the pain and the ecstasy of love, by misunderstandings,
by transient mental torment, by momentary jealousy on
the part of the woman, or by sportive or earnest threats; and this need
is gratified instinctively by man, because he feels instinctively that
love without it disappears or will disappear.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page561">[561]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">He explains this necessity for pain and sorrow in love as dependent
upon a degree of exhaustion, a fatigue of the nerve-centres concerned,
which demand a period of repose. In the ancestors of the
human race, and in the lower animals, this repose was obtained
by the <b>alternation</b> of quite opposite feelings, such as love and
hate; thus the occasional stimulation of those centres also by
which pain is perceived is a physiological necessity for the
nervous system.</p>

<p>Nothing, in fact, is harder to bear than a succession of beautiful
days; this is true even of love. Why is it that the very best,
unalterably tender wives or husbands are so frequently deceived?
Certainly it is because they often forget that with the sweetness
of love it is necessary to intermingle a little bitterness, and so to
allow their partner now and again to experience the &#8220;joy of grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mental pain as a general sociological, literary, and philosophical
phenomenon, manifests itself as <b>Weltschmerz</b> and <b>pessimism</b>.
Both modes of perception conceal intense feelings of pleasure.
Schopenhauer, who was well aware of this fact, remarks (&#8220;Works,&#8221;
ed. Grisebach, i., 508) that the recognition of the sorrows of
existence, of the misery which extends itself over the whole of
life, is accompanied by a <b>secret joy</b>, which by the &#8220;most melancholy&#8221;
of all nations was termed the &#8220;joy of grief.&#8221; Admirably
also has Kuno Fischer, in his account of Schopenhauer&#8217;s philosophy,
described the pleasure to be found in the pessimistic mode
of perception; and O. Zimmermann has written an interesting
psychological work upon the &#8220;Joy of Grief&#8221; (second edition;
Leipzig, 1885).</p>

<p>The pleasure anyone experiences in his own pain, or in that of
another, constitutes the <b>nucleus</b> of all algolagnistic phenomena, and
to <b>cruelty</b> as an intermediator in this painful lasciviousness there
belongs only a secondary r&ocirc;le. The deeply-rooted instinct of
cruelty, which first manifests itself in early childhood, is biologically
associated with the perception of pain. Various theories
of cruelty have been propounded. Thus, according to Schopenhauer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page562">[562]</span>
cruelty gives rise to pain in another, in order to diminish
its own pain; and, according to this view, it is only a means of
treatment for the relief of one&#8217;s own pain. More illuminating
is the explanation of the English psychologist Bain, who derives
cruelty from the consciousness of power and the enjoyment of
power, from the delight felt in dominating the tortured individual.
Nietzsche is the most celebrated apostle of this diffusion
of power, this enjoyment of power in the &#8220;superman,&#8221; and by
means of the &#8220;masterful morality.&#8221; He formally does homage
to cruelty as a means of advancing towards higher civilization.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Almost everything,&#8221; he says, &#8220;which we call higher civilization
depends upon the spiritualization and deepening of <b>cruelty</b>.... That
which constitutes the painful pleasure of comedy is cruelty; that which
is agreeable to our senses in the so-called tragic sympathy&mdash;fundamentally,
indeed, whatever is pleasurable to us up to the most intense and
delicate metaphysical horror&mdash;obtains its sweetness only from the
intermingled ingredient of cruelty. That which the Romans enjoyed
in the arena, that which Christ enjoyed in the Passion of the Cross,
the Spaniards regarding an <i>auto-da-fe</i> or a bull-fight, the Japanese of
to-day, with his love for the tragic, the Parisian workman who has a
passion for sanguinary revolutions, the Wagnerian rejoicing in the
spectacle of Tristan and Isolde&mdash;all alike enjoy, all alike are suffused
with secret ardour as they drain the Circe&#8217;s cup of &#8216;cruelty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must therefore,&#8221; he continues with justice, &#8220;for ever deny the
absurd psychology which attempted to teach regarding cruelty that
it arose only from the view of <b>another&#8217;s</b> pain! There exists an abundant&mdash;over-abundant&mdash;joy
also in one&#8217;s own pain, in making one&#8217;s
own self suffer; and whenever man persuades himself&mdash;it may be only
to self-denial in the religious sense, or to self-mutilation like the
Ph&#339;nicians and the ascetics, to self-torment in religion, to the puritanic
convulsive penitence, to the vivisection of conscience, and to Pascal&#8217;s
sacrifice of the intellect&mdash;in all these alike he is lured onwards and impelled
forwards by his cruelty alone, by that dangerous emotion of
cruelty <b>directed against himself</b>.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>With a few brilliant words Nietzsche thus describes the principal
phenomena of algolagnia. Ethnology and the history of
the world offer us in equal measure numerous interesting proofs
of the primitive tendency of human nature to sadistic and masochistic
manifestations. We must learn to recognize the diffusion
throughout the entire world of active and passive algolagnia,
making its appearance in the most diverse forms, in order to
understand many occurrences of the present day. In my &#8220;Contributions
to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis&#8221; (vol. ii.,
pp. 43-75, 95, 96, 109-113, 120-157, 228-240) I have collected
these anthropological and ethnological data, regarding the
universal diffusion of algolagnia in all epochs and in all countries;<span class="pagenum" id="Page563">[563]</span>
and I have referred to the occurrence of sadism and masochism
as affecting mankind <b>in the mass</b>, a fact of particular importance
in this connexion. To give some examples: Campaigns, gladiatorial
combats, man-hunts, beast-baiting,
<span class="nowrap">bull-fights,<a id="FNanchor596"></a><a href="#Footnote596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></span> sensational
dramas, public executions, inquisition and witch trials, lynch-law
as practised to-day in North
<span class="nowrap">America,<a id="FNanchor597"></a><a href="#Footnote597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></span> in the behaviour of
the crowd of onlookers at the former punishment of the pillory,
especially also in revolutions, of which to-day once more we have
the most horrible examples in Russia (<i>cf.</i> also the <a href="#Ref3">appendix</a> to
this chapter), in the primeval custom of marriage by capture, in
cannibalism, the belief in witches and werwolves, in slavery,
flagellantism, and the scourgers of the middle ages, the horrible
&#8220;satanism&#8221; of the same period, gynecocracy or the dominion
of woman, the service of women of the Minne epoch, the Italian
<i>cicisbeato</i>, and the Slavonic sexual slavery of men, asceticism and
martyrdom, the ethnological diffusion of skatological, koprological,
and urolagnistic practices, etc. These facts suffice to
prove that in all times, and among all nations, sadism and masochism,
in all the forms we still observe to-day, were most widely
diffused; and to show that they arise from certain instincts
deeply rooted in the soul of the people, whose existence <b>even
to-day</b> manifests itself everywhere. Take, for example, the
following extract from the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>, No. 475, October 10,
1906:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;A great automobile race which took place in Long Island at the
beginning of the month presented certain features reminding us of
the old gladiatorial games. Three men were killed during the race,
a woman and a boy were so seriously injured that at the time of
writing they are at the point of death, and from twenty to thirty
persons suffered fractures and other grave injuries. From all parts
of the United States as many as half a million persons had assembled
to see the races. At the very outset the huge crowd was in a state of
hysterical excitement. The Automobile Club had taken the utmost
care in its preparations for the safety of the course, and had shut it
off on both sides by a net 8 feet in height. This protecting wall was,
however, torn down by the crowd, which pressed in everywhere,
especially at those places which the cars were to pass at their highest
speed. Notwithstanding all the warnings of the police, those in
search of sensation only tried to get out of the way when the cars
were close upon them. At a turning in the course there were assembled
1,000 persons belonging to the best circles of New York society.
Every time when, at this dangerous point, one of the cars had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page564">[564]</span>
accident, these people rushed forwards, in order to see as closely as
possible what was going on; the women screamed and fainted from
excitement, while the police bludgeoned the people blindly, in order
to make room for the following cars, and in order to prevent worse
evils. <b>The spectators were as if mad with the desire to see blood.</b> A
lady who was pressing forward with the crowd, when one of the cars
had upset, expressed her disappointment plainly, &#8216;<b>Oh dear, there is no
one killed!</b>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In an essay entitled &#8220;Russia as It Now Is,&#8221; regarding the
Russian punitive expeditions against the revolutionaries, the
St. Petersburg correspondent of a German paper reports:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;These expeditions have long forgotten the political purpose of
their &#8216;mission&#8217;; they murder simply <b>out of congenital lust to murder</b>,
<b>from racial love of blood</b>, <b>from plainly perceptible morbid perversity</b>.
The shooting of boys, the flogging of women, without mentioning the
still worse &#8216;punishments&#8217; <b>which we cannot even venture</b> to <b>describe</b>,
which take place in the presence of, or with the actual assistance of,
the greater and lesser provincial satraps, and regarding which I have
collected extensive material&mdash;all produced in me, who have been a
student of criminal psychology, very remarkable reflections.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In these cases, no doubt, the principal cause of the actions in
which cruelty becomes pleasurable is the <b>powerful emotional
disturbance</b>, the violent excitement, which, again, increases
sexual desire. De Sade himself was familiar with the fact that
excitement produced by strong emotions had a powerful influence
upon sexual processes; that it increased them, changed
them, and led to abnormal manifestations. &#8220;All sensations
increase one another mutually.&#8221; Anger, fear, rage, hatred,
cruelty, increase sexual tension, and therewith also increase the
pleasure of the discharge of that tension.
<span class="nowrap">Bouillier<a id="FNanchor598"></a><a href="#Footnote598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></span> drew attention
to the fact that frequently in men, who otherwise have
exhibited in their life very genial and sympathetic natures, it
is not the desire of blood and suffering in itself which evokes
sexual cruelty, but it is the desire for this associated increase in
emotions. Similarly, <span class="nowrap">Horwicz<a id="FNanchor599"></a><a href="#Footnote599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></span>
explains the joy of martyrdom
also as dependent upon the powerful sexual stimulation which it
produces.</p>

<p>A peculiar form of sexual excitement associated with emotional
disturbance has been described by Charles F&eacute;r&eacute;, under the name
of <b>ergophilia</b> (&#8220;Note sur une Anomalie de l&#8217;Instinct Sexuel: Ergophilie,&#8221;
published in <i>Belgique M&eacute;dicale</i>, 1905). The case was that
of a woman, twenty-six years of age, who when a child of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page565">[565]</span>
had first experienced sexual excitement at a fair while watching
a little girl juggler of her own age playing with three
balls. Subsequently every time when this scene occurred to her
memory she had a sexual orgasm; also when once at a circus she
was watching some gymnasts whose performance was characterized
by elegance and ease, she had the same experience. The
same also occurred when she saw a man use a scythe. In a
frigid marriage she always returned to these imaginations, as the
only means of obtaining sexual gratification. F&eacute;r&eacute; is right in
distinguishing from sadism this form of sexual excitement induced
by the view of elegant bodily exercises. The <b>generally</b>
exciting view of movement had in this case a <b>special</b> exciting
influence upon the genital organs of an obviously hysterical
person. Perhaps also the case reported by Amrain (<i>Anthropophyteia</i>,
vol. iv., p. 242) is similar to this&mdash;a case in which a man
fifty-three years of age was sexually excited by the spinning
round of prostitutes on rapidly rotating stools.</p>

<p>Helvetius, Bain, Lully, James, Herbert Spencer, Steinmetz,
and many other psychologists and anthropologists, have endeavoured
to explain on <b>evolutionary</b> grounds this intimate
association between the emotions, and to establish an association
between cruelty and sexuality. They suggest that the gratification
of sexual needs is for the individual a love-battle, involving
the sacrifice of numerous opponents in order to gain the favour
of the beloved being. <b>In this way there arose an association
between the shedding of blood and sexual enjoyment</b>; and the
rage of battle, as Marro very rightly insists, may sometimes be
suddenly transferred from the rival to the female herself, and
thus assume a sadistic character. Definite traces of this connexion
may still be observed among the popular customs of many nations,
as, for example, in New Caledonia, where the girls are pursued
by their lovers into the bush, and, after they have been overpowered,
and after sexual intercourse has taken place, &#8220;they are
brought back, bitten, bruised, scratched, covered with bites on
the shoulders and the back of the neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>I regard the emotional theory of cruelty as the best, because it
provides the easiest explanation of all the facts; and above all,
because it also explains the frequently observed cruelty of <b>woman</b>,
who, as the <b>more easily excited</b> creature, displays a higher, more
artificial kind of cruelty than man, whose balance is not so
easily disturbed by his emotions.
<span class="nowrap">Montaigne<a id="FNanchor600"></a><a href="#Footnote600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></span> makes the acute
observation that cruelty is usually accompanied by a feminine<span class="pagenum" id="Page566">[566]</span>
softness. Havelock <span class="nowrap">Ellis<a id="FNanchor601"></a><a href="#Footnote601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></span>
also remarks that the most extreme,
most elaborate degree of sadism is commonly associated with a
somewhat feminine organization.</p>

<p>We might explain the cruelty of women, and that of enervated,
effeminate voluptuaries from fear and cowardice, from the
debasing consciousness of the weakness of their own personality,
which by means of cruelty takes <b>revenge</b> on the strength of another,
and transiently luxuriates in the associated intoxication of power,
in the mere <b>idea</b> of superiority. It is certainly in this way that
we must explain the horrible cruelty of worn-out debauchees,
such as is described by de Sade in his romances. Such types
also were Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Heliogabalus, and
C&aelig;sar Borgia; among women, Catherine de Medici and those
&#8220;delicate Creole women who, after enjoying voluptuous pleasure
in intercourse with a negro slave, proceed to enjoy the further
pleasure of seeing the man unmercifully
<span class="nowrap">flogged.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor602"></a><a href="#Footnote602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition, <b>the blunting of the senses</b> which results from long-continued
sexual excesses demands the stronger stimulus of
cruelty. Just as in the debauchee, so also in the prostitute,
this blunting of the senses induces a predisposition to sadism.
Many prostitutes and masseuses become sadists quite as much
from inclination as from custom (the latter from intercourse
with masochistic clients); and they find sexual pleasure in tormenting
men, regarding themselves as incorporate ideals of
&#8220;mistresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among Europeans, <b>residence in hot climates</b> gives rise to a peculiar
form of tropical cruelty, the so-called &#8220;<b>tropical frenzy</b>.&#8221;
The psychology of this condition is complex. Various predisposing
causes must concur in order to produce tropical frenzy.
In the first place, it occurs almost exclusively in Europeans who
fill official positions giving them <b>very extensive powers</b>, such as
they did not enjoy before leaving home. Those who become
affected live usually in regions in which all the limitations of
conventional morality and of social relationships with their fellow-countrymen
are laid aside, so that the civilized man is in a
position which enables him to follow without restraint his own
inward impulses; also he finds himself in contact with an &#8220;inferior&#8221;
race, which he regards and treats as half or completely
<span class="nowrap">animal.<a id="FNanchor603"></a><a href="#Footnote603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></span>
The influence of climate is also of great importance,
as Hans von Becker assumes. Owing, it may be, to the intense<span class="pagenum" id="Page567">[567]</span>
heat, disturbances of metabolism ensue, and by the formation
of toxins, the central nervous system and the psyche are injured,
and thus there is induced a &#8220;tropical moral insanity,&#8221; a morbid
impulsiveness, associated with complete loss of understanding
of ordinary ethical and moral principles. Or, again, it is possible
that, as Plehn believes, the abnormally high temperature gives
rise to acute outbreaks only in chronic alcoholists, taking the form
of tropical frenzy. In any case, this disorder is with especial
frequency characterized by marked sadistic practices, as is proved
by the colonial scandals of every country. In connexion with
this, we do not need any further demonstration of the manner in
which the institutions of <b>slavery</b> and <b>serfdom</b> have always induced
and furthered sadistic instincts, and, speaking generally, the
same is true of all relationships by which isolated individuals
are given uncontrolled powers over the bodies and lives of their
fellow-men.</p>

<p>A chief cause of algolagnia, of active algolagnia, but more
especially of the passive form, is to be found in the <b>diverse sexual
demeanour of man and woman</b> respectively, and this, again,
depends upon the difference between the masculine and feminine
natures. Opposed to the stormy, eager activity of the man, we
have the quiet passivity of the woman. The latter has aptly
been compared to a magnet which, notwithstanding its own
apparent immobility, still irresistibly attracts and holds fast
the iron (the man), making the latter in a sense her slave; upon
this passivity depends the unmistakable superiority of woman in
<b>purely sensual</b> love. Physical nature alone gives her an advantage
over man, just precisely in the point to which she outwardly
appears subordinated to him. Thus, among the Indians of
Central Brazil man is officially lord and master of woman&mdash;and
does what she <span class="nowrap">wills.<a id="FNanchor604"></a><a href="#Footnote604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></span>
Thus it has always been in the highest
grades of civilization also, wherever sensual relationships have
been solely effective in determining the relative positions of men
and women. The true &#8220;<b>henpecked husband</b>&#8221; (I say &#8220;true,&#8221;
because there also exist such in appearance only) of our European
civilization is the man who, from the beginning, has been subjected
to the domination of his wife in consequence of his own
immoderate sexual needs; by these needs he has been permanently
placed under her control, and this control has secondarily
been extended to other relationships. This is the psychological
secret of the henpecked state, just as it is also of the &#8220;<b>mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page568">[568]</span>
rule</b>,&#8221; which, beginning as a purely sexual relationship between
king or prince on the one hand and his mistress on the other, later
extends also to the domain of political activity. The greater the
sexual passivity and coldness of the woman, the more readily does
she gain dominion over the man. A favourite means for this
purpose is the practice of &#8220;<b>coquetry</b>&#8221; (a matter previously discussed),
which can also be defined as the activity of women in
fettering men to themselves and in bringing them under feminine
dominion. The Anglo-Saxon &#8220;<b>flirt</b>&#8221; is only a lighter shade of
&#8220;coquette,&#8221; representing rather spiritual-&aelig;sthetic coquetry,
whilst the true coquette makes use of purely <b>sensual</b> means, and
speculates upon sex only, without reference to the intellectual
qualities. &#8220;A truly coquettish woman listens with pleasure to
the rankest flattery of the most insignificant individual; she takes
the trouble to stimulate the desires of the most contemptible
being, although she is daily surrounded by longing
<span class="nowrap">admirers.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor605"></a><a href="#Footnote605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></span>
Joseph Peladan relates in one of his romances how a distinguished
lady, while getting into her carriage, intentionally displayed her
leg to a poor man standing by, although at the very same moment
she was coquetting audaciously with a gentleman of her own
rank. Woman instinctively aims at the subjection of man, and
voluptuous stimulation serves her as the best-tried means of doing
this. In so far as man becomes the &#8220;slave&#8221; and victim of his
sensuality, does he exhibit a masochistic disposition; but, in so
far as by his force and his intelligence he overcomes this sexual
dependency, and by means of his natural activity and energy
displayed also in sexual relationships, behaves heedlessly and
brutally to the woman, who has now become completely passive,
does the sadistic element preponderate in him. From this we
are able to understand how it is that sadism and masochism
may often appear in the same person; they are only the active
and the passive form respectively of the algolagnia which
lies at the basis of both of them, and in which the true essence of
both these phenomena subsists.</p>

<p>When in the following paragraphs we briefly describe the
individual phenomena and types of sadism and masochism, we
do this always with the tacit implication that the majority of
types are not pure forms either of sadism or masochism, but represent
a mixture of both. This is especially true of the most
widely diffused of all algolagnistic perversions, the so-called
<b>flagellomania</b> (<b>sexual desire for flagellation or flagellantism</b>)&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page569">[569]</span>
is to say, <b>flogging and whipping, or being flogged and whipped
in order to induce sexual excitement</b>. An elaborately critical
account of sexual flagellantism in its physiological, psychological,
literary, and historical relationships is to be found in the second
volume of my work on &#8220;The Sexual Life in England,&#8221; pp. 336-481
(Berlin, 1903). In this passage there is a fairly complete
collection, alike of the older and of the newer literary material
devoted to this <span class="nowrap">topic.<a id="FNanchor606"></a><a href="#Footnote606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></span></p>

<p>Flagellation is, therefore, the principal means by which sadistic
tendencies become active, because in this manner all the physiological
sadistic accompaniments of sexual intercourse unite, and
make their appearance with a stronger potentiality. It is an
imitation and a conscious synthesis of these sadistic accompaniments,
which in their most primitive form are to be seen in the
lower animals. Especially in the case of tritons and salamanders
we can observe a typical flagellation, effected by means of the tail,
prior to coitus. The voluptuous gratification during flagellation
varies in character according as the flagellation is active or passive.
The nature of the latter is as follows: by vigorous friction and
blows, especially in the region of the genital organs, and more
particularly on the buttocks, a peculiarly increased voluptuous
stimulus is induced by the painful sensations. Simple <b>massage</b>
and <b>friction</b> of the skin suffices to produce such an effect, especially
after warm baths, as has long been known in the East, and is
employed in the so-called &#8220;Turkish baths.&#8221; More especially,
the rubbing of the buttocks evokes a <b>purely physical reflex
stimulation</b> of the spinal and sympathetic <b>ejaculatory centre</b>;
still more rapidly is this produced by flogging and whipping of
these parts (the so-called &#8220;lower discipline&#8221;). The painful
sensations are said ultimately to undergo complete transformation
into voluptuous sensations; unquestionably the <b>imagination</b>
must here render much assistance, and the masochistic element
is especially marked in those who undergo passive flagellation.
The increased flow of blood to the genital organs, to which the
flagellation necessarily gives rise, must also obviously play a
part in evoking and strengthening the voluptuous sensation.
Simultaneously also this congestion gives rise to erection of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page570">[570]</span>
penis; hence the very ancient employment of flagellation to relieve
impotence, alluded to by Petronius in a celebrated passage
of his &#8220;Satyricon.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the case of active flagellation, the voluptuous stimulation
is mainly of a sadistic nature; the view of the parts quivering
under the lash, becoming red or even bleeding, the cries of the
person who is being whipped, the erotic influence of the kallipygian
charms, here play the principal r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>The inclination to flagellation, both passive and active, is
generally aroused <b>by some chance occurrence</b>, such as looking at
a flogging, when the spectator finds himself to be in a state of
sexual excitement and recognizes its cause&mdash;as, for example, in
consequence of the official and ritual practice of flogging in schools,
<span class="nowrap">prisons,<a id="FNanchor607"></a><a href="#Footnote607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></span>
barracks, monasteries, etc., also by whipping and giving
blows in social games. Especially dangerous is the whipping of
<b>children</b>, whose sexual impulse is only too often aroused by
blows upon the buttocks, and then, unconsciously, this excitement
is in their minds permanently endowed with a causal
connexion with whipping, from which ultimately a perversion
(flagellomania) is induced. Well known is Rousseau&#8217;s description
of this connexion in his &#8220;Confessions.&#8221; I append the following
description by a patient of this tendency to flagellation:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In a similar way to that which you describe, flagellantism was unfortunately
awakened in me in early youth. This was first developed
in me by the fact that my parents allowed the maidservants to exercise
a far-reaching right of chastisement. When I was fourteen years old,
I still received whippings from the servants, with my father&#8217;s knowledge
and consent; and these whippings, since my father had forbidden any
other kind of chastisement as harmful to health, took place on the
buttocks, and were always effected after this region of the body had
been bared. I still remember most vividly that when I was at the
age mentioned a maidservant who was hardly two years older than
myself switched me in this region with especial zeal. I remember
also that when I was in my ninth year, owing to the free use which the
maidservants commonly made of their privilege, I had entirely ceased
to dread this chastisement; indeed from that time I often intentionally
incurred a whipping by the maids, which was not difficult; and from
the age of fourteen years I personally gave the maidservants my permission
to chastise me in the above manner without the knowledge of my
parents, and was always thrown by it into a state of sexual excitement.
Such excitement was also produced in me by merely witnessing
the chastisement of my two sisters, who were somewhat younger than<span class="pagenum" id="Page571">[571]</span>
myself, both of whom were still beaten with a switch when they were
fifteen years of age. As regards my two sisters, this did not lead to
desire on their part that this procedure, which was always disagreeable
to them, should be frequently repeated, but they were always glad to
see me whipped; and, as a matter of fact, my own sensation of pleasure
was greatly increased by their being present, and moreover, especially
in later years, I always enjoyed it more if the maidservant whipped
me in the presence of her friends or if one of them let me hold her
hand during the process. I especially preferred being struck with
the bare hands, although occasionally I endured severe whippings
with the stick or with the dog-whip at my own special request.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In a second case which came under my own observation, the
person affected being a lawyer, then twenty-eight years of age,
the cause of the development of his flagellomania was different
and more indirect.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>At the age of eleven or twelve years he was lying on the top of a
dog-kennel and masturbating, and he had tied his feet to the top of
the kennel, lest, when in a state of sexual excitement, he might fall
off. Since then he had always felt an impulse to have himself tied, which
he sought to satisfy in boyish games (robbers, police, etc.); this always
induced in him agreeable sexual feelings, which were further increased
by onanistic friction. At the age of fifteen there became associated
with this desire to be tied a further need to be whipped while he was
tied up. This patient has a disinclination to normal coitus and to
the female genital organs, but he desires to receive flagellation only
from women. Two successive attempts at normal sexual intercourse
were unsuccessful. The patient induced in a maidservant the inclination
to passive and active flagellation, and this woman, although
she resisted at first, was subsequently, six months later, a passionate
flagellant. In other respects the patient is thoroughly healthy, and
has been through his one-year term of military service in the cavalry.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>With regard to the origin of &#8220;<b>schoolmaster&#8217;s sadism</b>,&#8221; which
is, unfortunately, very widely diffused, the well-known case of
the schoolmaster Dippold recently gave a horrible
<span class="nowrap">example.<a id="FNanchor608"></a><a href="#Footnote608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>The teacher or schoolmaster may, at the commencement of his
activity, be entirely free from any flagellantic tendency. This
tendency makes its appearance in the course of the customary
exercise of his duties of physical chastisement. This gradually
induces in him a sense of sexual pleasure. As long as these
chastisements are kept within normal bounds, and only occasionally
undertaken, we have to do merely with a tendency, with an
aberration of sexual gratification, such as occurs in numerous
healthy individuals, even when they are not teachers or schoolmasters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page572">[572]</span>
persons who seek and find an opportunity for the exercise
of these tendencies in the brothel or with &#8220;masseuses.&#8221;
When, however, a systematic flagellomania develops, and the
person affected no longer merely chastises, but maltreats and
tortures, and does this habitually and with bestial cruelty, as in
Dippold&#8217;s case, we certainly have always to do with sadism
developed in the soil of a morbid predisposition. The following
cases appear to be of this nature:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. A case which reminds us of that of Dippold recently appeared
before the Second Criminal Chamber in Hamburg. The accused was
a man belonging to the cultured classes, who had had a University
education, had become a reserve officer, and had filled many other
positions, finally that of the editor of a journal published by an advertising
firm. The accused lived in Berlin in the years 1900 to 1903.
There he formed an intimacy with a woman, whom he induced to entrust
him with her son, for the continuance of his education. Going
himself to live in Hamburg in July, 1903, the boy was sent to him
in that town in January, 1904, and was placed in a boarding school.
&#8220;In order not to be disturbed in his teaching,&#8221; the man also rented
a room in the neighbourhood of the school. When engaging this room
he asked the landlady if there were curtains to cover the windows.
On the first day on which she visited the room the landlady noticed
that the accused flogged the boy, and as she did not wish to allow
this in her dwelling, she reported the matter to the police. After
some time the woman learned by questioning the boy certain remarkable
facts, especially with regard to the &#8220;educational methods&#8221;
which the accused had carried out in Berlin, and in her report to the
police she added certain details, which led to the arrest of the accused.
The accused admitted that he had caned the boy severely, and he
declared that he had done this only for educational reasons, as the
boy was of a bad character. In this respect the statement of the
accused was confuted by the evidence of the boy&#8217;s teacher in Berlin,
that of his teacher in Hamburg, and that of the inmates of the pension
in which he lived; all of these gave him a very good character.
With respect to the mode of chastisement, the details of which were
heard <i>in camera</i>, the court held that there was no doubt that the
accused had chastised the boy, not for educational reasons, but on
account of perverse tendencies of his own, and condemned him to
imprisonment for one year and loss of civil rights for two years. It is
a noteworthy fact that the accused, during the latter part of this
period of association with the boy, had lived in a happy marriage with
a young woman.</p>

<p>2. A disciple of Dippold. The following remarkable case was
published in the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, No. 629, December 11, 1903:
A furniture-polisher of this town accosted boys whom he met in the
street, gave them some trifling commission, and so arranged matters
with them that they must ultimately return to him at his room. Here
he gave himself out to be a detective officer, showed the boy a token
which he pretended was his official commission, and then gave the
boy a severe lecture. &#8220;He regretted,&#8221; he said in conclusion, that,
owing to the misconduct of the lad, it would be necessary to fine his<span class="pagenum" id="Page573">[573]</span>
parents, unless the offences were condoned by the immediate chastisement
of the boy. The &#8220;detective&#8221; easily persuaded his victims that
it would be better to accept the immediate flogging. After he had
stretched his victim across his knees and beaten him with a stick,
he looked to see that the blows had not made too obvious marks, and
sent the lad away with a further brief admonition. In most instances
the boys who had been whipped concealed what had happened from
their parents; but still the matter came to light, and this new Dippold
is to be tried for causing grievous bodily harm, and for the false pretence
that he occupied an official position. The accused is a young man,
twenty-five years of age, and, with his small and slender figure and with
a blonde moustache, he makes rather the impression of a young man
of eighteen.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Very frequently the tendency to flagellation is at first artificially
evoked in brothels. Hogarth, in his &#8220;A Harlot&#8217;s Progress,&#8221; has
rightly depicted the switch as a necessary requisite of the interior
of a brothel, and this simple instrument of flagellation is rarely
absent from a prostitute&#8217;s dwelling. It appears to be England
alone, the classical country of flagellomania, in which actual
&#8220;flagellation brothels&#8221; have
<span class="nowrap">existed.<a id="FNanchor609"></a><a href="#Footnote609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></span> A historical example is
that of the celebrated establishment of Theresa Berkley, the
inventor of an especial apparatus for the whipping of men, the
so-called &#8220;Berkley-Horse.&#8221; It appears that in England the
female sex has a taste for active and passive flagellation; and we
find that a German <span class="nowrap">author<a id="FNanchor610"></a><a href="#Footnote610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></span>
attributes to woman a greater inclination
towards flagellomania than that exhibited by man. This
tendency is encouraged by certain male flagellants, who obtain
sexual gratification by the flagellation of women. Gu&eacute;nol&eacute;
(<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 151, 152) reports the existence of secret places in
Paris where young women and girls combine to form a kind of
&#8220;school,&#8221; in which male sadists carry out &#8220;instruction&#8221; with the
switch!</p>

<p>In connexion with flagellation we must consider the peculiar
tendency to the <b>fettering</b> of the individual to be flogged, who
desires to be rendered <b>defenceless</b>. For this purpose various
apparatus exist of the same kind as the &#8220;fettering-chair&#8221; invented
in the eighteenth century by the Duke of
<span class="nowrap">Fronsac.<a id="FNanchor611"></a><a href="#Footnote611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></span> Of the same
nature also is the impulse to wear very tight shoes and gloves<span class="pagenum" id="Page574">[574]</span>
and very small corsets, the so-called &#8220;<b>corset discipline</b>,&#8221; in which
the person affected, who may be of either sex, is laced up very
tightly in a very small corset. This is met with chiefly in England,
especially in association with sexual flagellation.</p>

<p>In comparatively rare cases flagellomania is a morbid condition
by which responsibility is entirely abrogated; but from the
medico-legal point of view responsibility is impaired or suspended
in the majority of cases of well-marked sadism, which we have
now to describe. To this category belong:</p>

<p>1. <b>Sadistic Bodily Injuries and &#8220;Lust-Murder.&#8221;</b>&mdash;The main
types of this category are the &#8220;girl-stabbers&#8221; and the &#8220;lust-murderers,&#8221;
who simply for the purpose of producing sexual excitement,
or when already under the influence of such excitement,
inflict on women more or less severe injuries with a knife or other
murderous instrument. The actual intention to <b>kill</b> is present
only in very rare cases. The lust-murder is, as a rule, only a
murder as a <b>sequel</b> of a sexual act committed by force, the murder
being done from fear of discovery, etc.; thus the murder has not
in these cases anything directly to do with the sexual act. In
other cases we have what appears to be a lust-murder in which
death has resulted, contrary to the wish of the offender, from a
sadistic bodily injury. Killing from a purely sexual motive is
a very rare occurrence, of which, however, some very widely
known cases are on record&mdash;like those of Andreas Bickel,
Menesclou, Alton, Gruyo, <span class="nowrap">Verzeni,<a id="FNanchor612"></a><a href="#Footnote612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></span>
and &#8220;Jack the Ripper,&#8221; the
Whitechapel murderer. [Regarding the Whitechapel murders,
see E. C. Spitza, &#8220;The Whitechapel Murders: their Medico-Legal
and Historical Aspects,&#8221; published in the <i>Journal of
Nervous and Mental Diseases</i>, December, 1888. Great attention
and alarm was aroused in Paris in the years 1818-1819 by a girl-stabber
(<i>piqueur</i>). In numerous caricatures, popular songs, and
vaudevilles these assaults were &#8220;celebrated,&#8221; of which a very rare
pamphlet, &#8220;La Piqure &agrave; la Mode&#8221; (Paris, 1819), gives evidence.
<i>Cf.</i> J. Grand-Carteret in &#8220;Les Images Galantes&#8221; (1907, No. 7).
Much alarm was caused in July, 1902, by the crimes of a new
&#8220;Jack the Ripper&#8221; in New York, and by the horrible child-murders
committed in Berlin by an obviously insane sadist,
not yet arrested. In a single day he ripped up the abdomens
of several small children with a pair of scissors.] Many &#8220;murder
epidemics&#8221; (<i>manie homicide</i>), such as the murders recently
committed in Sweden by Nordlund, who, though indubitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page575">[575]</span>
insane, was executed for them, are certainly connected with
sexuality. The two following cases from German experience
relate to typical &#8220;girl-stabbers&#8221;:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p><i>Ludwigshafen am Rhein, March 26, 1901.</i>&mdash;After the manner of the
Whitechapel murderer, an unknown criminal had for several weeks
made the parts of the town lying in the direction of the suburb of
Mundenheim unsafe. Not less than eleven girls were seriously injured
after nightfall by stabs in the abdomen. To-night the police succeeded
in arresting the criminal, who is a drover, Wilhelm Damian
by name, twenty-eight years of age. Five years ago he was suspected
of having committed a lust-murder on a servant-girl; he was arrested
at this time, but was discharged owing to the lack of sufficient proof.
Now the suspicion is aroused that Damian is responsible also for the
lust-murder committed two years ago near Mundenheim on a little
girl seven years of age, because the circumstances of that case suggested
that the murderer was a butcher by occupation, and this applies to
Damian.</p>

<p><i>Kiel, November 29, 1901.</i>&mdash;It is not yet possible to arrest the
stabber who, during the last week, has been active in the poorest
quarter of the town. At first he limited himself to the northern districts,
and there wounded only women and girls; but in the last day
or two he appeared, not only in the central parts of the town, but
also in the southern quarter, where, the day before yesterday, in the
evening, he wounded a girl by two stabs, one in the neck and one in
the hip. Since then a man has been stabbed, apparently by this same
evil-doer, but was not seriously hurt. This happened in one of the
busiest streets of the town, so that the escape of the criminal is very
remarkable.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Other peculiar sadistic injuries sometimes occur. Thus, in
the year 1902 a printer, twenty-two years of age, was condemned
by the criminal court of Breslau, because in <b>thirteen</b> cases he
had thrown <b>oil of vitriol</b> at young ladies! Here also we have
probably to do with a sadistic tendency. In the end of October,
1906, in Berlin, a case came under notice in which a young girl
took another girl to the dentist (!) and (after previous an&aelig;sthetization)
had two teeth drawn unnecessarily; but whether this
case was or was not of a sadistic nature remains undetermined.
But we certainly have to do with sadism in those cases in which
men or women inflict slight injuries on their love-partner for the
purpose of sucking blood, which gives them sexual gratification
(<b>sexual vampirism</b>). Many <b>murders by poison</b> (women murderers
commonly prefer the use of poison to that of any other instrument)
also arise from sadistic tendencies. At any rate, the
majority of professional female prisoners, such as Jegado,
Brinvilliers, Ursinus, Gottfried (the celebrated poisoner of
Bremen), and others, were unquestionably women given to sexual
excesses or sexually very excitable, so that here voluptuousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page576">[576]</span>
and the lust for murder appear to have an intimate causal
connexion.</p>

<p>The following remarkable case of sadistic deprivation of freedom
is reported by Kiernan (&#8220;A Remarkable Case of Fetishism,&#8221;
published in <i>The Alienist and Neurologist</i>, 1906, p. 462):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Two citizens of good position, of Wladikaukas, in Russia, had repeatedly
carried off girls of good family, and had treated them in an
extraordinary way. On account of senile dementia they were acquitted
of criminality, and were sent to an asylum. The last victim
was a young heiress, who was kept prisoner by them for an entire year.
Two masked elderly men fell upon her by night, gagged her, put a
bandage over her eyes, and drove away with her in a carriage. When
the bandage was taken off, she was in a well-furnished drawing-room.
The two old men, without saying a word, gave her a scanty dress of
feathers, and shut her up in a great gilded cage, which stood in the
drawing-room. One of them&mdash;she never saw the other again&mdash;came
in silence to visit her every morning, looked at her through the bars
of the cage, often threw her lumps of sugar, and every morning brought
her a can of hot water, which he emptied into a vessel inside the cage,
saying, &#8216;Take a bath, little bird.&#8217; These were the only words which
she heard. After a year had passed, the man let her out of the cage,
put a bandage over her eyes, and drove her in a carriage to a place near
her house. No similar case is known to me in medical literature.
Everything was conducted Platonically; there was no coitus, no exhibitionism
or masturbation, either before or after looking at this peculiar
bird. Certainly there must have been some kind of abortive sexual
gratification, of a sadistic character, and with the limitation that only
young girls of good family, dressed as birds and kept in a cage, could
excite libido. But why must they have the appearance of a bird?
Possibly in the subconsciousness the idea of the bird as a lascivious
animal played a certain part. But why did one only come and
see the &#8216;bird&#8217; every day? That they must be young girls is natural
in the case of old men: extremes meet; but that they must be of
good family suggests a sadistic element, and still more is this suggested
by the imprisonment.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>2. <b>Offences against Property committed from Sadistic Motives.</b>&mdash;To
this class belong all sadistic injuries not of the person, but of
property. For example, pouring vitriol over the clothing, of
which the following case (<i>Vossische Zeitung</i>, No. 574, December 7,
1905) is an example:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>At the present time an unknown man is making the south-eastern
districts of Berlin unsafe by the use of oil of vitriol. This dangerous
criminal pours the liquid upon women&#8217;s clothing, selecting by preference
light-coloured fabrics. Yesterday evening he almost completely
ruined the new light-coloured dress of a young lady who was passing
along the Hermannstrasse. The offender, who apparently derives
pleasure from injuring women&#8217;s clothing, is of middle height, about
twenty-five years of age, has fair hair, and wears a fashionable overcoat.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>To the same category belongs <b>arson</b> from sexual motives, which
was <span class="nowrap">formerly<a id="FNanchor613"></a><a href="#Footnote613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></span>
attributed to a &#8220;passion for fire&#8221; (pyromania);
but when sexual motives play a part, it is unquestionably of a
purely sadistic <span class="nowrap">nature.<a id="FNanchor614"></a><a href="#Footnote614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the same character is <b>sexual kleptomania</b>&mdash;theft from sexual
motives. Lichtenberg was familiar with this, for he says &#8220;the
sexual impulse very frequently leads to thefts,&#8221; and he alludes
to the proposal which has been made in England to castrate
<span class="nowrap">thieves.<a id="FNanchor615"></a><a href="#Footnote615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>The organic causation of the kleptomania so often seen at the
present day in large shops is very frequently of a sexual nature,
dependent upon puberty, the climacteric, menstrual anomalies,
etc. Cases of this character have been reported by Worbe,
G&ouml;nner, Schmidtlein, Unzer, H&auml;ussler, Lombroso, and Ferrero.
The suspicion of sexual sadistic grounds for kleptomania may
always be justifiably entertained when rich ladies repeatedly
steal articles of small value of which they have no need.</p>

<p>A typical case of sexual kleptomania is reported by H. Zingerle
(&#8220;Contributions to the Psychological Genesis of Sexual Perversities,&#8221;
published in the <i>Annual for Psychiatry and Neurology</i>,
1900):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A woman, twenty-one years of age, who from childhood had been
psychopathic, had from her school-days onwards had a definite desire
to appropriate certain objects, especially such as were made of brown
leather (brown shoes), umbrellas, money. Only the act of stealing gave
her any gratification, not the keeping of the stolen objects, which she
usually destroyed or gave away. <b>During the act of theft she had a
well-developed sense of voluptuousness, accompanied by a discharge
of secretion from the genital organs.</b> She performed these thefts as
the result of an irresistible impulse, and after them she felt remorse.
She preferred large objects such as were difficult to hide, and it was
<b>precisely when there were great hindrances to be overcome and dangers
to be run</b>, and when in the pursuit of her aim she was <b>subjected to
emotional disturbances</b>, that the accompanying <b>voluptuous sensations
were most prominent</b>. The psychopathic basis of this condition is
unquestionable.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In addition to these two categories of sadism, which for the
most part depend upon morbid conditions, we meet also with a
<b>symbolic</b> form of sadism, where this manifests itself rather in
idea than in reality, and where the person thus affected luxuriates<span class="pagenum" id="Page578">[578]</span>
in all possible <b>fantasies</b> of the infliction of pain and of
<span class="nowrap">abasement.<a id="FNanchor616"></a><a href="#Footnote616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></span>
This mitigated sadism is certainly to some extent
connected with physiological sadism. Thus the so-called <b>verbal
sadism</b> is nothing more than an increase in, an emphatic instance
of, the physiological voluptuous sighing and crying <i>in coitu</i>,
whose influence in verbal sadism is increased, and exercises a
stronger stimulus, by the accentuation of the <b>animal</b>, the <b>brutal</b>,
the <b>coarse</b>, and the <b>obscene</b>. Verbal sadism is not a peculiar
refinement of modern debauchees, but a phenomenon belonging
to folk-lore and ethnology, an extraordinarily widely diffused
mode of expression of the primitive sadistic instinct of the genus
homo. In the popular speech of all countries we find that
<b>abusive terms</b> and <b>curses</b> are intermingled with extraordinary
frequency with sexual matters and ideas. The na&iuml;vet&eacute; of this
sexual depravity and cursing, with its thousandfold variations,
shows its origin from the purely instinctive sources of the popular
soul, as the celebrated brothers Grimm recognized when they
devoted a careful, critical investigation in their well-known
dictionary to the obscene verbal treasury of the Germans. A
rich material for the study of the sources of verbal sadism is
offered by the <i>vocabularia erotica</i> of Hesychios; also by the
<b>collections</b> of local and provincial <b>riddles</b> and
<span class="nowrap"><b>proverbs</b>.<a id="FNanchor617"></a><a href="#Footnote617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></span> A
typically developed verbal sadism is found among the Hindus,
especially the women. The Indian erotist V&#257;tsy&#257;yana rightly
deduces it from the various sounds which are uttered in normal
coitus. In European brothels the verbal sadists and verbal
masochists are well-known phenomena&mdash;men who find sexual
enjoyment in the expression of the coarsest, commonest, obscene
words, curses, and abusive language; in some cases by doing this
themselves (verbal sadism), in other cases by listening to it when
done by others (verbal masochism). Such verbal sadists, also,
are the individuals described by A. Eulenburg (&#8220;Sexual Neuropathy,&#8221;
p. 104) as &#8220;verbal exhibitionists,&#8221; people who gladly
indulge in lascivious conversation in the presence of women, or
who whisper obscene words in women&#8217;s ears. Many men visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page579">[579]</span>
prostitutes, not for the purpose of having sexual intercourse
with them, but merely for the opportunity of such lecherous
conversation. The following case, complicated by bisexual or
masochistic features, is characteristic of this:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A leading merchant of middle age visits a cocotte from time to
time, and puts on the girl&#8217;s silken clothing, whilst she must put on
man&#8217;s dress; they then go out walking arm-in-arm in dark, unfrequented
streets, and converse meanwhile in an extremely obscene,
indecent manner; this alone suffices him for sexual gratification.
During the whole time he does not touch the girl.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This sexual depravity and obscene language can also be conducted
by correspondence. Thus we have a kind of &#8220;<b>epistolary
sadism</b>&#8221; and &#8220;<b>epistolary masochism</b>.&#8221; The former, especially,
is frequently employed in the circles of the &#8220;masseuses&#8221; and
&#8220;strict governesses,&#8221; in relation to their masochistic <i>client&egrave;le</i>,
whilst the answers belong to the second category.</p>

<p>A remarkable symbolic form of sadism or masochism is represented
by <b>inunction</b> and <b>lathering</b>, for the purpose of sexual
gratification. Lathering with soap more especially is a phenomenon
with which those who have to do with brothels are
especially familiar. Either the man finds sexual pleasure in
lathering the prostitute or he experiences gratification in the
passive attitude when she lathers him. Some time ago, in a
trial in which a man belonging to one of our leading mercantile
houses was accused, I referred in my evidence to analogous
occurrences in brothels and among prostitutes. This testimony
was disputed by another physician, who stated that this &#8220;lathering&#8221;
for the purpose of inducing sexual excitement was &#8220;unknown&#8221;
to him. It is, however, a well-known phenomenon
whose existence has been confirmed to me by colleagues in Berlin,
and more especially in Hamburg. According as it is active or
passive, it is respectively sadistic or masochistic. Whether, in
such cases, a defilement of the woman&#8217;s person is effected, as in
a case reported by von Krafft-Ebing, in which a man blackened
his mistress with charcoal, is indifferent. The larval sadism
consists in the <b>act of manipulation</b>, in the inunction or lathering.</p>

<p>As a last form of symbolic sadism may be mentioned <b>blasphemy</b>
based on <b>sexual motives</b>, the so-called &#8220;<b>satanism</b>,&#8221; which played
a great part more especially in the middle ages, and as the
&#8220;black mass&#8221; constituted a peculiar cult, in which the Christian
Mass was profaned by sexual practices, and was insulted to the
uttermost. According to Schwaebl&eacute;, these obscene masses are
still celebrated at the present day in two places in Paris. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page580">[580]</span>
gives a detailed description of such a black mass which was celebrated
in a house in the Rue de
<span class="nowrap">Vaugirard.<a id="FNanchor618"></a><a href="#Footnote618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Passive algolagnia</b>, <b>masochism</b>, the desire to endure <b>pain</b> and
<b>degradation</b> and <b>abasement</b> of every kind, for the purpose of
inducing sexual excitement, is perhaps to-day more widely
diffused even than its <span class="nowrap">converse.<a id="FNanchor619"></a><a href="#Footnote619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></span>
The cause of this, which is to
be found in the conventionality of our time, is a matter to which I
have previously more than once alluded (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page322">pp. 322</a>-<a href="#Page324">324</a>,
<a href="#Page467">467</a>-<a href="#Page469">469</a>). This view is supported also by the remarkable fact
that, above all, <b>lawyers</b>, leading State officials, and judges,
constitute a disproportionately large contingent of masochists&mdash;that
is to say, persons whose professional life gives them a certain
unusual exercise of power, and whose profession imposes on them
a strict official demeanour. Precisely these conditions, perhaps,
arouse masochistic tendencies to activity, as a kind of liberation
from conventional pressure and the professional mask.</p>

<p>The connexion between love, voluptuousness, and the suffering
of pain, has already been discussed. In masochism there also
comes into play the important element of abasement, a complete
self-surrender of body and soul, self-sacrifice. The union of these
perceptions and their voluptuous tinge has been beautifully
described by Alfred de <span class="nowrap">Musset:<a id="FNanchor620"></a><a href="#Footnote620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;My passion for my mistress had become extremely unruly, and my
whole life had assumed a kind of monastic savagery. I will give
only one example of this: She had given me her miniature likeness
in a medallion. I wear it on my heart&mdash;many men do this. But one
day in the shop of a second-hand dealer I found an iron scourge on
the end of which was a small plate covered with little spines. I had the
medallion fastened on to the plate and wore it in this way. The
spines, which at every movement pierced the skin of my breast, produced
in me the most peculiar ecstasy, so that I sometimes pressed
my hand on the place in order to drive them deeper. I am well
aware that this was folly; but love makes us commit many such follies.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In masochism physical pain plays an important part. The
&#8220;mistresses&#8221; have at their disposal an extensive instrumentarium
for producing such pain, for masochists often have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page581">[581]</span>
most peculiar ideas regarding the mode in which their pain
should be caused. Probably unique in their kind are the two
following authentic cases, which my colleague, Dr. <span class="nowrap">D&mdash;&mdash;,</span> in
Hamburg, was so good as to report to me:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. A rich Hamburg merchant, known among the prostitutes by the
name of &#8220;Nail William,&#8221; had sexual intercourse only with certain
prostitutes, who had to allow their nails to grow quite long and pointed.
They had to scratch him on the scrotal raphe and on the penis until
the blood flowed in streams. One day he consulted a physician on
account of extensive &#339;dema of the scrotum and the penis.</p>

<p>2. Another man had his scrotum sewn to the sofa-cushion with
thick sail-maker&#8217;s needles. He sat for a while in this &#8220;fettered&#8221; condition,
after which the strings were cut!</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>All possible cutting and stabbing instruments and burning
substances are used for the gratification of the masochist&#8217;s lascivious
love of pain; they have themselves scratched, bitten,
pinched, burned, their hair torn out; they are trodden upon,
whipped with switches or ox-whips; they have themselves
&#8220;put to the question&#8221; in every possible way in special &#8220;<b>torture
chambers</b>&#8221; or &#8220;punishment rooms.&#8221; Such a genuine torture
chamber, in the house of a Hamburg prostitute, was recently
described by the public prosecutor, Dr. Ertel, in
<span class="nowrap">Hamburg.<a id="FNanchor621"></a><a href="#Footnote621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></span>
Of the dwelling of this prostitute the following account is given
in the testimony of the examining judge:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>To the side of the flat towards the bath-room is the door of entrance
to the so-called &#8220;black room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The walls of this room, lighted by one window only, were covered
with a coal-black material of the nature of calico, and the plaster of
the ceiling was similarly covered; to the middle of the ceiling, proceeding
from the centre of a black rosette, was attached a pulley,
consisting of the usual rollers and blocks, made in this instance of
metal, and furnished with a strong twisted cord.</p>

<p>In the dark corner between the window and the wall there stood
a peculiar scaffold, made of roughly hewn planks, consisting of two
similar parts placed side by side; the back of this scaffold was placed
against the wall beside the window.</p>

<p>The purpose of this scaffold was not immediately apparent. Seen
sideways, the form of this wooden structure was somewhat like that
of a heavy, coarsely-made armchair; the upper parts of the arms were
about the height of a man&#8217;s shoulders. To the framework along the
upper edge there were attached five fairly strong iron rings, which were
screwed into the wood. The framework ran on rollers, so that it could
be moved about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page582">[582]</span></p>

<p>On the wall was hung on a nail a leather girdle with buckles;
there was also a rope about the thickness of the finger, ending in a
loop; there were also two dog-collars, part of a sword-stick, leather
reins, and fetters for wrists and ankles, the former being heavy iron
handcuffs.</p>

<p>The window in the wall separating the &#8220;black room&#8221; from the
bathroom, the glass of which was frosted, was covered with special
hangings. The inner side of the door of the room was also hung with
black.</p>

<p>In respect to this &#8220;black room&#8221; A. testified:</p>

<p>&#8220;Z. insisted that one room should be entirely draped with black,
as the &#8216;hall of judgment.&#8217; He sent me pulleys from Cologne, by which
he was to be drawn up and <span class="nowrap">hanged.<a id="FNanchor622"></a><a href="#Footnote622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></span>
This excited him, his face got
quite blue, and it made him &#8216;ready&#8217; for intercourse. I was afraid
that it might kill him, and I only allowed him to have it done once.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the wooden framework in the &#8216;black room,&#8217; Z. was securely
fastened, so that he had the illusion that he was on the scaffold.&#8221;</p>

<p>In all large towns widely diffused <b>masochistic prostitution</b>
subserves the desires of male masochists, and frequently also
those of female masochists. These priestesses of <i>Venus flagellatrix</i>
hide themselves commonly under the cloak of a
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>masseuse</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor623"></a><a href="#Footnote623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></span>
an &#8220;<b>educationalist</b>,&#8221; or &#8220;<b>governess</b>,&#8221; adding to this professional
title the expressive adjective &#8220;<b>severe</b>&#8221; or &#8220;<b>energetic</b>.&#8221;
&#8220;<b>Wanda</b>&#8221; is also a favourite pseudonym, which corresponds to
the masochistic nickname of &#8220;<b>Severin</b>&#8221; (the principal character
of Sacher-Masoch&#8217;s &#8220;Venus im Pelz&#8221;).</p>

<p>These women, the &#8220;mistresses,&#8221; treat their masochistic clients
as &#8220;slaves&#8221; or &#8220;dogs,&#8221; and maintain this fiction not only in
personal association, but also in correspondence&mdash;masochists are
all passionate correspondents. The relationship also of the &#8220;<b>lady</b>&#8221;
to her &#8220;<b>page</b>&#8221; is a favourite one (the so-called &#8220;<b>pagism</b>&#8221;). The
nature of the relationship is clearly shown in the following original
letter of such a masochist:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="right"><span class="padr6">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>,</span><br />
<span class="padr2">&#8220;<i>June 7, 1902</i>.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gracious Lady</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="padl4">&#8220;First</span> of all I must sincerely ask your pardon for daring, most
honoured lady, to write to you. I saw recently a lady with a glorious
figure and magnificent hips enter your house, and I suspect that you
are this lady. If you, gracious lady, desire a servant and a slave,
who will blindly obey all your commands, and upon your order, as a
slave, without any will but your own, will perform the basest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page583">[583]</span>
dirtiest services, I should be happy if you would be so gracious as to
make me that slave, if I might visit you from time to time in order to
serve you, my strict mistress and commander. If at any time I
should fail to obey you absolutely, you can treat me most cruelly and
chastise me most severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you, gracious lady, deign to answer me, your basest servant,
and to make use of the enclosed envelope to tell me if you, this
evening, will go for a walk, and how, and where, in what caf&eacute; you
may chance to spend the evening, and if you will be my strict mistress,
and if I may venture to be your slave. Perhaps, most honoured
lady, you could be at the Oranienburger Tor at eight o&#8217;clock precisely
on <b>Friday</b> evening, with a rose in your hand. Full of subjection
and abasement, obedient to your strict commands, and slavishly
kissing your feet and hands, I am your most abject servant and
your basest slave.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Such a slave luxuriates voluptuously in the lowest services, in
the most loathsome abasements, such as are indicated sufficiently
in the names &#8220;<b>coprolagnia</b>&#8221; and &#8220;<b>urolagnia</b>.&#8221; I have in my
possession a series of letters by masochists full of such things,
described with the utmost particularity, some even in a poetic
form (!), which I cannot print on account of their loathsome
contents. A sufficient idea of the slavery of the masochist is
given in the above-mentioned report of the public prosecutor,
Dr. Ertel, in which a &#8220;mistress&#8221; states:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;When I took my meals he lay either under the table, or in a
corner of the room; I threw him bones, and gave him the remains of
my own food. He often barked, and usually had a dog-collar round
his neck, with a chain attached to it. He had given himself the name
of Nero, so this is what I called him. When anyone wished to come
near me without permission, he bit him in the leg; this was the first
step in a slave&#8217;s duty. He swept out my room, boiled potatoes,
roasted meat for me, and did other work of the house. He also
wanted to be my horse; I had to ride on him; he carried me in this
way from one room to the <span class="nowrap">other.<a id="FNanchor624"></a><a href="#Footnote624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></span>
When he disobeyed me in any
way, I had to use the whip. He related to me that formerly he had
corresponded with a music-hall comedian who played woman&#8217;s parts,
and subsequently had associated with him, but he got weary of this,
and disappeared for a long time to get free from the man. He told
me also that he was accustomed to make appointments in the Schaarhof
(a street in Hamburg in which the prostitutes visited by the lowest
classes of the population live). On Sunday evenings these women
have many visitors, when the workmen have got their week&#8217;s money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page584">[584]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Often I had to shut him up in a wardrobe, with a chain round his
neck, fastened to the wall of the wardrobe, so short that he could
hardly move; the door of the wardrobe was shut upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my flat I had to give him a slave&#8217;s dress to wear, in order
that he might feel himself to be fully a slave. I took away all his
money, all the keys of his house, of his office, and of his safe, and
returned them to him only after a night and two days. Z. only does
this occasionally, when he is utterly beside himself; often he is quite
reasonable. He does not associate with any decent people; the
society in which he feels happiest is that of whores and other obscure
persons; he has himself said this to me. Even the people who make
use of him avoid him in the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would also learn to dress hair, and how to paint the face, if I
ordered him. Painted faces stimulate him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once he said to me that I might have another slave; this I did.
First of all I had to bind Z. hand and foot, and to wrap up his head
in cotton-wool, in order to give the new slave the idea that he had been
very badly treated, and had been sent to the hospital. When, later,
the new slave came, and I explained everything to him as Z. had told
me to, and led him in to see Z., the new man was very much surprised
to see Z. tied up in this way, became frightened, and soon went home.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Another prostitute reports:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I made the acquaintance of Z. in No. 8, Schwiegerstrasse. He
has three or four times had intercourse with me. He had himself
whipped by me. Z. once asked me to fetch a man, which I did.
This man got into bed with me, and satisfied himself manually, without
having intercourse with me. Z. on this occasion lay under the
bed: he wished to do so; I believe he had arranged this in order to
obtain sexual excitement in this way. Z. and the other man did
not see one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the other man had gone away, Z. did the most disgusting
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Z. had himself whipped, he first had his hands fastened
with iron handcuffs.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It would be quite erroneous to assume that in the case of these
masochistic &#8220;slaves,&#8221; whose human worth has been lowered to
the depths, who seem completely to discard their humanity and
to sink below the level of animals, that we always have to do with
effeminate, degenerated weaklings. No; much more frequently
they are <b>healthy, powerful men, of an imposing appearance and
distinguished demeanour</b>, who find pleasure in playing such
tragic r&ocirc;les, and who obviously obtain sexual gratification by
this complete reversal of their nature. The &#8220;slave&#8221; just
described was &#8220;by nature tall and stately. His features were
<b>energetic</b> and sympathetic, and he had a large beard. His eyes were
<b>clear and bright. In actions and appearance he was a thoroughly
masculine</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>being.</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor625"></a><a href="#Footnote625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></span>
In Berlin there exist masochists in high
official positions, in appearance and in profession true manly<span class="pagenum" id="Page585">[585]</span>
natures&mdash;&#8220;supermen&#8221;&mdash;who only become &#8220;slaves&#8221; in relation
to their &#8220;mistresses.&#8221; According to Sacher-Masoch, Germans
and Russians especially are inclined to masochism; but, as a
matter of fact, this tendency is also widely diffused in France
and England. Zola describes such a type in &#8220;Nana.&#8221;</p>

<p>The slave type is not always completely developed; more
commonly masochism manifests itself in a less marked degree.
There are many and various shades: sometimes there is only a
spiritual abasement, exhibited in apparently trifling procedures
and practices (symbolic masochism). A few authentic cases
will serve to illustrate this&mdash;they sound incredible, but are in
fact true:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. A handsome and fine-looking officer, married to a beautiful wife,
continually associates with an elderly, robust washerwoman, with
whom he also has sexual intercourse. Since he refuses to leave this
woman, his wife has separated from him.</p>

<p>2. A State official of high position, fifty years of age, visits a prostitute
from time to time, and puts on her clothing, with corset and
stockings, while she wears man&#8217;s clothing. Then for two hours they
play cards. At eleven o&#8217;clock he lays himself, still clothed, in her
bed, whilst she must lie down naked upon the bed covering. Nothing
else happens. He does not make the least attempt to touch her;
and after a time he goes away, first paying her fifty marks.</p>

<p>3. An active Minister of State (!), now deceased, used often
to visit a cocotte, who had to sit upon him, and then <i>in corpus
totum ei minxit</i>. This was sufficient to give him sexual gratification
(urolagnia).</p>

<p>4. An engineer meets a prostitute (who has been previously instructed
what to do) in the street, and asks her if he may go home with her for
twenty marks (shillings). Having reached the home of the girl, he
suddenly declares with tears that he has only five marks with him.
The prostitute overwhelms him with abuse, takes the five marks
from him, and then carefully searches his clothing, until somewhere
or other she finds a hundred-mark piece! The moment of the
discovery of this piece of money is precisely the moment when the
man has the sexual orgasm. In answer to his prayers and whining,
to his pitiful request that she shall at least give him back half the
money, he only receives scornful abuse. Finally, she presses one
mark into his hand, and gives him his <i>cong&eacute;</i>. This procedure is
repeated regularly every fortnight&mdash;an expensive amusement for a
man who is by no means wealthy. But he is unable to give up this
peculiar passion, which for him is the only way of obtaining sexual
gratification.</p>

<p>5. A man of the upper classes, thirty years of age, frequents only
prostitutes with artificial teeth. They must take these teeth out, and
he puts them in his mouth and sucks them. He then stretches himself
upon the covering of the bed, and the prostitute must lay one of her
dirty chemises upon his face, whilst he at the same time holds one of
her shoes in each hand. This is for him the critical moment. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page586">[586]</span>
the girl herself during the whole procedure he does not direct a single
glance; for him there exist only the teeth, the chemise, and the shoes.
Thus we have to do with a case of masochism with mental fetishistic
associations. The previously described medieval &#8220;cure by disgust&#8221;
(the exhibition of a dirty chemise) would in this man have had the
opposite effect to that intended.</p>

<p>Masochism is much commoner in men than in women, because
the latter have more command over their sexual impulse, and
are not so readily subordinated and enslaved thereby as are
men. The physiological masochism of woman is of a more
spiritual nature. Still, in women who are very excitable sexually
a similar &#8220;sexual obedience&#8221; may appear to that which we
encounter in men. Shakespeare, in the &#8220;Midsummer-Night&#8217;s
Dream,&#8221; when he makes Helena feel herself to be Demetrius&#8217;
little dog, gives her definite masochistic characteristics.</p>

<p>Masochistically inclined, also, are women of good position who
play the part of prostitutes, either in brothels or in the streets,
such as have recently been described by d&#8217;Estoc in &#8220;Paris-Eros&#8221;;
we may regard the celebrated Messalina as their prototype.
Similarly disposed are women of good position who have
enduring sexual relationships with men of the lower classes,
such as workmen, coachmen, etc., and who even seek sexual
enjoyment with any casual member of the rabble they may meet
in the streets&mdash;a practice of which Lombroso has collected
examples. Passive algolagnia also occurs in women, as is proved
by the following letter of a typical masochist:</p>

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE RUSSIAN
REVOLUTION (HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN
ALGOLAGNISTIC REVOLUTIONIST).</h3>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The author of the following sketch, the Russian anarchist N. K., was
arrested in Warsaw in the early months of 1906. Like all those who
at this time were considered to be members of the revolutionary party,
the intention of the authorities was to shoot him immediately, without
any elaborate inquiry, after a drum-head court-martial.</p>

<p>His demeanour during the shooting of his companions, who preceded
him to death, and also during the court-martial, showed that his
psychical individuality was so profoundly abnormal that the Colonel
in command of the firing-party suspected him to be a psychopath,
and on his own authority postponed his execution pending further
examination in the citadel. While imprisoned K. wrote his reminiscences,
which are here given word for word and without comment:</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>My parents were opposite elements: my father, strong, coarse,
brutal, egotistic, material to excess; my mother, suffering, delicate,
sensitive, ethereal. From such a cross, a masochistic character <b>must</b>
necessarily be produced. My father brought me up with storms,
chastisements, and fear; my mother counteracted all this with
caresses, kisses, and tears.... I <b>trembled</b> with secret anxiety and
<b>exulted</b> inwardly at the same moment when my father stretched me
across his knees. As soon as the punishment was over, he immediately
proceeded to box someone&#8217;s ears&mdash;anyone&#8217;s, a footman&#8217;s, a maid&#8217;s,
anyone&#8217;s. I ran with a smarting posterior to my mother. By her
first my injuries were inspected, then I was cried over, embraced,
kissed, and finally laughed at and with. This scene repeated itself
at irregular intervals. To these years belong my first memory of the
masochistic principle of life. This was based upon the following
observations:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page588">[588]</span></p>

<p>All my companions, boys and girls alike, endeavoured to play tricks
on one another; to tell tales of one another to their parents, tales true
and false; in every way to cause suffering, in order then, by redoubled
love, to make all right again. On the other hand, I noticed that no
child loved another unless it was tormented by that other. Those who
did not torment one another were mutually indifferent.</p>

<p>This mutual tormenting and <b>being</b> tormented must therefore, <b>in
the nature of things</b>, produce a certain charm, gives rise to a <b>pleasure</b>.
This pleasure consisted in increasing, mentally realizing, <b>sympathizing</b>
with, the pain of another. This is <b>not sadism</b>&mdash;generally speaking,
sadism does not exist&mdash;it is only <b>refined masochism</b>; for we prepare pains
in order to sympathize with them&mdash;that is, in order that we may free
<b>ourselves</b>.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed teasing girls, destroying their toys, tearing
their dolls to pieces, dirtying their clothing, etc. When, thereupon,
they wept bitterly, I fought against their tears, until finally they were
consoled. Then I went close to them, embraced them, caressed them,
kissed them, and cried with sympathy. What pain and what pleasure
did I experience when they pushed me away, struck me, and spat in
my face! I bought them once more finer toys, and was <b>so happy</b> when
their tears gave place to laughter!</p>

<p>How often I told false tales of other children to their parents, in
order to be able to sympathize with the mental pain of an undeserved
chastisement! But I was no exception in this, because most of my
playmates were the same. I remember how a girl of eleven calumniated
a boy of twelve: she declared that he had put his hand on her
private parts when she was out walking! The happy, poor lad was
frightfully beaten at school and at home. All the children baited him,
despised him, and avoided him like the plague.... He became quite
afraid of his fellows.</p>

<p>What did I live through at that time?</p>

<p>Moody and spiteful, he lay under a tree; the girl who had told this
false tale about him softly drew near, stood by him, and with a pleading
voice called his name. Furiously he jumped to his feet, and wished
to run away; but she seized his hand, fell upon her knees, and begged
for his forgiveness. It was useless for him to abuse her, to strike her,
and to tread upon her toes. She threw her arms round him, cried as
if her heart was broken, and spoke tenderly to him for so long a time,
until at last he sat down beside her, and allowed himself to be caressed.
Thus they sat together for a long time, and wept and laughed and wept.
Suddenly she seized his hand and pressed it violently between her
thighs....</p>

<p>This contact formed the last link of a long logical chain....</p>

<p>These were the <b>facts</b> which first made me feel instinctively how,
like every fundamental thing&mdash;everything which is of a primeval
character: primeval force, primeval matter, primeval impulse, etc.&mdash;all
represent the union of two extremes; the primeval impulse &#8220;love&#8221;
can also be the coalescence of two opposites. These two opposites
in <b>this</b> case are pleasure and pain; as in the case of electricity we have
the union of the two opposites, positive and negative electricity; in
the case of magnetism, we have the union of positive and negative
magnetism; in the case of the atom, the positive and negative ion;
in the case of sex, man and woman, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page589">[589]</span></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>My years of school and University life were spent at St. Petersburg.
Tempestuously I threw myself upon simple physical &#8220;love&#8221; (!), upon
the orgies, upon all the varieties, of physical love. Bodily-sexual
masochism, with all its artificial sensual charms, was a cup which I
drained to the dregs; but I was never able to explain to myself why
humanity was satisfied with so crude a definition of the idea of
&#8220;masochism.&#8221; Sexual masochism is indeed one of the most obvious
facts of life. But the same is true also of sexual love; and yet we do
not maintain that love is only sexual impulse.</p>

<p>I passed beyond this physical masochism; it was for me a necessary
phase of development. <b>The spiritual element within me began to
sway my existence.</b> At this time I learned to love a girl of a wonderful
character. She loved me to a similar degree of insanity.</p>

<p>Had I been a beggar or a tramp, she would have followed me through
the streets. She would have accompanied me to forced labour in
Kara, Kamtchatka, or Saghalien. For me she would also have
mounted the scaffold; to save me she would even have become a
prostitute. It was a blessedness to love her and to be loved by her.</p>

<p>How can we wonder that in conformity with this interminable love
accompanying sorrows should also extend into infinity, and ultimately
lead to a catastrophe?</p>

<p>Every night we slept together, although for months at a time we
did not have sexual intercourse; we embraced one another so closely
and slept <b>so gently</b>!...</p>

<p>To separate from one another only for a few hours was a torment.
If I went out alone, I must tell her the precise moment at which she
might expect me to return. If I remained away a quarter of an hour
longer, Mascha at once pictured to herself that I had been run over
by a tram, that I had fallen down in an epileptic fit, that I had suddenly
become insane and jumped into the Neva, or that some other disaster
had befallen to me. Thus she stood continually at the window, in
order to see what was passing in the street. If anyone came up to
our floor, she ran quickly to see who it was. If it was not I, then she
felt horrible anxiety. When at length I came, she stood waiting for
me in the doorway, laughing and crying at the same time. Then
there followed embraces and kisses as if I had returned from a journey
to the North Pole; but also reproaches, such as, &#8220;You do not love
me at all; if you did you would not torture me so! You know how
anxious I always am about you when you are away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gradually I began to understand this condition, <b>as an inevitable
consequence of the masochistic principle of love</b>.</p>

<p><b>This martyrdom of the soul, which lovers prepare for themselves in
the unceasing dread of losing one another, or of losing one another&#8217;s
love, is intimately connected with the very nature of love. Without
anxiety of this kind, love would be unthinkable. He who loves must
continually torment himself with this anxiety; and the stronger the
love, the greater is this torment. When the torment is increased by
the other&#8217;s participation in it, the mutual love is also increased thereby.</b></p>

<p>This necessity we also felt, and we resolved to procreate an illegitimate
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page590">[590]</span></p>

<p>What this step meant to us&mdash;members of leading families&mdash;can
readily be understood; but we proudly resolved to defy society at
large, in order to consecrate our love by the sorrows which this would
entail.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>As soon as Mascha became pregnant, I felt an irresistible impulse
to increase our mutual torments! To increase them!! To increase
them!!! For our love did not appear to me sufficiently great, nor
yet sufficiently worthy, nor yet sufficiently holy, for us to crystallize
ourselves in a new living being.</p>

<p>This idea racked me continually. In vain I sought to convince
myself that our love was a million times greater than the love of
ordinary mortals, that it was unique!... Again and again my conscience
said to me: &#8220;How can you use for <b>yourself</b> the measuring rule
of ordinary men, even if they are the leaders of men? You are the
<b>conscious</b> masochist! Your <b>ideals</b> must be suited to this fact! Is it
anything so much out of the common to have an illegitimate child?
You must increase your sorrows! Increase them!!&#8221;</p>

<p>(He proceeds to describe how in every possible way he tormented his
beloved.)</p>

<p>At length, in consequence of my continued vexation, Mascha
became as nervous as <b>I</b> was myself.... Now she really began to
take everything perversely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me in peace! It is your fault! You are driving me quite
out of my mind!!&#8221;</p>

<p>On account of the most trifling matters we became furious with rage,
mutually making one another more wretched and more bitter. Ten,
twenty times a day, we stood facing one another, leaning forwards,
shaking with wrath, our mouths gaping with anger, our eyes sparkling,
our fingers widely separated, like tigers ready to spring; many times
she struck me in the face or spat at me!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you wretch! How I hate you!!! I should like&mdash;I should
like&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then we said to one another calmly and quietly that we did not
suit one another; that we had been deceived; that everything was
now at an end; we begged one another for forgiveness, and separated.</p>

<p>Soon came the pangs of conscience, the question, &#8220;Who is to
blame?&#8221; Now the pains began: &#8220;What have I done? It is impossible
that it <b>can</b> be so; I will beg her forgiveness upon my knees. She
must be <b>mine</b> again&mdash;must be, must be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, love, love! How interminable is your pain!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I began with nervous haste to say to myself, &#8220;Where will she
be? With Katja? Up! Go to her and ask her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Mascha been here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;she has just gone away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she not say where she was going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!... Have you quarrelled once more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!... A little, but it was my fault!... I must find her!...
Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the house of A, B, C, and D she was not to be found. Is it
possible that in her pain&mdash;&mdash;? No, no! Not <b>that</b>! Not <b>that</b>!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page591">[591]</span></p>

<p>This pulsed in my temples, whilst I ran up and down the stairs!</p>

<p>Six o&#8217;clock! now she will go out walking on the Newsky-Prospekt!!...</p>

<p>At last I reach the Newsky-Prospekt! I rush up and down looking
for her! Is that she? No! Or there? It is not she! That must
be she? No&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes, yes!... It is she.... Now walk
a little more slowly.... Now she sees me.... She turns as if to pass
by on the other side.... She changes her mind and stays on this
side....</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been out walking long?&#8221;...</p>

<p>Mascha lies in my arms. We cry and laugh&mdash;cry and laugh....
Never, never, never again!!... Forgive, forgive!!... We embrace
one another, press one another, kiss one another, as if we could be absorbed
into one another.... We abuse one another, pull one another&#8217;s
hair, and playfully box one another&#8217;s ears.... Then we rub our
cheeks together, and give one another the maddest pet names....</p>

<p>Oh, paradise of love! Why did I quarrel with my fate which
imposed upon me such unheard-of torments?... Nothing else could
have brought me such blessedness as this!!</p>

<p>Oh, fate! More, more, still more martyrdom!... In this way
let my love grow!</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Our life together became continually more intolerable, and yet we
could not bear to be away from one another a single hour. A terrible
fate chained us together, and threw us into the maelstrom of this
furious impulse, irresistible in its elemental force. To tear ourselves
apart was rendered impossible by the fetters that chained us together.</p>

<p>Continually more frightful, continually more insane, became our
scenes, and the love-eruptions which broke out from time to time.</p>

<p>(After mutual spiritual torments, becoming ever worse and worse,
K. begs his beloved to procure abortion!)</p>

<p>She wept quietly, then kissed me and went out....</p>

<p>The key grated in the lock....</p>

<p>&#8220;Mascha! Mascha! For God&#8217;s sake! Mascha! What are you
going to do?...&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook the door like a madman.... It would not give way....
I tore open the window.... &#8220;Help! Help!&#8221;... The door was
burst open.... Break open Mascha&#8217;s door!... It was quickly
forced.... She lies there.... Dead.... Poison....</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Finally&mdash;after weeks&mdash;I was once more somewhat calmer, and was
able to think a little. I had so utterly lost all power that I was only
able to get from my bed to the sofa, or back again, with assistance.
They had been afraid that I should not get over it at all.... Week
after week to endure the most shattering, superhuman sorrows, to
oscillate between death and madness!...</p>

<p>But superhuman <b>love</b> had also been mine! The statue of Sa&iuml;s
had been unveiled to me!... I had quaffed the cup of love to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page592">[592]</span>
<b>last</b> dregs!... But he only will have had this experience who has first
drunk to the dregs the draught of <b>sorrow</b>!...</p>

<p>Oh, short-sighted world, which will call the murder of Mascha
&#8220;sadism&#8221;!... Had not her pains cut twice as deeply into <b>my own</b>
heart? Has not <b>my</b> soul been convulsed by her torment?... I
wished only to torture <b>myself</b>!... Am I to blame that it was only
possible to do so through her martyrdom?... Has not <b>she</b> shared
also all my superearthly blisses?... He who has experienced <b>this</b>
does not regret&mdash;even if he must pay <b>double</b> the price in sorrows!!</p>

<p>Is not that &#8220;<b>masochism</b>&#8221;?</p>

<p>Have you who wished to pass judgment on me learned that? No!
Who will set up to be a judge of a case of which he knows nothing?</p>

<p>Oh, crude psychology, which teaches that out of an <b>inhuman</b> impulse&mdash;out
of cruelty&mdash;we commit &#8220;crimes&#8221; on those nearest to us!
Only from a purely <b>human</b> impulse&mdash;from &#8220;love&#8221;&mdash;do we do to the
nearest to us what you call &#8220;crimes,&#8221; in order that he may share
that unnamable happiness which we ourselves feel. Thus the influences
which move us are purely <b>ethical</b>.</p>

<p>Do you believe that we only are masochists? Or do you believe
that those only are masochists who have themselves trodden on by a
prostitute, have had their ears boxed, have been whipped, befouled,
and have let the prostitute spit in their faces?</p>

<p>Oh, idiots! I say to you all love is masochistic, and all which leads
to it is associated with it, or results from it, bears the imprint &#8220;pleasure
and pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nature <b>never</b> fails. Who, then, believes that it was caprice, chance,
or irony, on Nature&#8217;s part, when she associated <b>love</b> with so much
<b>torment</b>?</p>

<p>Who does not think of all the tragedies of <b>unhappy</b> love, with its
murders and suicides, all its physical and spiritual martyrdom, which
every day brings to us?</p>

<p>Who does not think of the tragedy of sexual love which is offered
to us in the hospitals? all the hundreds of thousands who have to pay
for the licentiousness which results from sexual <b>lust</b>&mdash;all the tabetics,
syphilitics, general paralytics, etc.?</p>

<p>Who does not remember the torments which the sexually perverse
have brought on themselves and on humanity? All the <b>lust-murders</b>!
And all the punitive measures? The lust-murders which we commit&mdash;to
prevent lust-murders!...</p>

<p>Who does not think of the torments of pregnancy? its risks of
life and death?</p>

<p>Are all these mistakes of Nature? No! No!! The accompaniment
of pleasure by pain must have some definite purpose. This
purpose is: <b>That pleasure, without its opposite, pain, would not be
perceptible, would be unthinkable, would be inconceivable&mdash;just as
cold could not be apparent to our consciousness without heat, or light
without darkness. Thus pleasure, in the absence of pain, would not
be perceived as pleasure. Therefore, by increase of pain, pleasure
becomes of greater value, for the greater the contrast the more readily
do we perceive it.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;<b>Masochism is thus a natural law.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p><b>The more fully it is developed in any individual, the higher, the more
superhuman is that person.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page593">[593]</span></p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>Through the recognition of the masochistic natural law, I passed
into a peculiar condition. Individual love and sorrow no longer made
any particular impression on me. I began to observe masochism in
the life and work of Nature, in the history of humanity, in social life,
and in civilization.</p>

<p>Is not the great developmental principle of Nature based upon this&mdash;that
the existence and progress of the species is dependent upon
pressure exercised on it by its environment? The more difficult the
conditions of existence, the harder the pressure of the environment,
the more <b>suffering</b> the species has to bear, the stronger must be the
reaction against these, the more strongly will the powers and capacities
of that species become active, and by this the species will be elevated
to a higher level.</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>Thus suffering is the driving force of Nature. Nature is therefore
masochistic!</b>&#8221;</p>

<p>Within the species itself the same law holds. Within the &#8220;human&#8221;
species have not those varieties developed to the highest which have
had to overcome the <b>hardest</b> environment? Those who by nature
have been troubled with the greatest difficulties in providing for their
food-supply? Those who have <b>suffered</b> most?</p>

<p>Is not the existence of the living being dependent upon the
&#8220;struggle for existence,&#8221; upon the mutual hostility of the species,
striving for one another&#8217;s annihilation?</p>

<p>It is a characteristic trait of human nature that all religions are
based upon the same fundamental principle: &#8220;Only by <b>suffering</b> canst
thou become happy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Is not this true <b>masochism</b>, when humanity, by means of modern
science, has also been robbed of the hope of a beyond, of the hope for
eternity and blessedness, and is offered <b>nothing</b> in its place? Look at
universal history!</p>

<p>Was not the birth of that great idea associated with frightful sufferings,
with the influence of fire and sword, blood and death? Has
not humanity crucified its greatest benefactors? Has it not rewarded
them with the gallows, the torture-chamber, the wheel, the
stake, the prison, and the asylum?</p>

<p>And all out of <b>love for humanity</b>!</p>

<p>All the persecutions of Christians and Jews, the inquisitions and
burnings of heretics, witch-trials, the religious sorrows of all times&mdash;all
were outflows of the <b>love for humanity</b>. Their aim was to safeguard
mankind from the robbery of its happiness by heresy!</p>

<p>The love of humanity begat our Neros, our Torquemadas, our Ivans
the Terrible, and Schdanows!</p>

<p>Why did these men torture other men?... In order <b>themselves</b>
to realize in imagination the others&#8217; torments, to sympathize with
them, to feel with them. In order in their own spirit to endure these
martyrdoms; that is to say, to torture themselves with the representation
of the pain of another.... &#8220;<b>Thus in its motives sadism is nothing
else than masochism.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p>The <b>love of humanity</b> erected the cross of Christ, lighted the faggots
with which Huss and Bruno wore burned, tortured Thomas M&uuml;nzer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page594">[594]</span>
stabbed Marat, decapitated Hebert, and built the gallows of Arad,
St. Petersburg, Chicago, etc.!</p>

<p>The <b>love of humanity</b> built the Bastille, the Tower of London, the
Spielberg, Blackwell&#8217;s Island, and the Schl&uuml;sselburg, built the torture-chambers
of the Inquisition, constructed the medieval penal system,
and those of Montjuich, Alcalla del Valle, Borissoglebsk, and many
others.</p>

<p>Remarkable! That precisely your &#8220;love of humanity&#8221; was the
most cruel tormentor, the most inexorable executioner, the most
bloodthirsty butcher of men, and the greatest of all criminals.</p>

<p><b>Do you not see in all this the wise rule of the masochistic principle?
That it was only persecution which diffused these ideas?</b> All the
progress which man makes in <b>civilization</b> must be paid for by means of
enormous sacrifice. The superhuman sorrows of millions of slaves
created the civilization of antiquity&mdash;the Ph&#339;nician, the Babylonian,
the Persian, the Assyrian, the Greek, and the Roman! (With regard
to this often disputed fact, see Mommsen: &#8220;In comparison with the
sufferings of the slaves of antiquity, all the sufferings of modern
negro slaves are simply a drop in the ocean!&#8221;)</p>

<p><b>Indian</b> civilization is the product of the most horrible suppression
and plunder of the lower castes by the higher. The soil of the Southern
States of America was cultivated through being manured with the
sweat, blood, and bones of negro slaves.</p>

<p>The soil of Europe, again, was made fertile by the sufferings of
slaves and serfs, and so on!</p>

<p>Amid the most horrible birth-pangs, amid the slave rebellions,
peasant wars, and revolutions, in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and
twentieth centuries, mankind was enabled to throw off the shell of the
feudal system. Therewith capitalism was born. This newest form
of civilization, once more, is based upon horrible plundering, oppression,
and misery of millions and millions of proletarians.</p>

<p>What a devastation of humanity results from the acquirements
of civilization in respect of engineering and the practical arts!...
Every invention and discovery demands its victims!...</p>

<p>How often have chemists been destroyed by an explosion in the
creation of new compounds, or killed by the development of poisonous
vapours!</p>

<p>Count the engineers who have been sacrificed to their profession, or
bacteriologists who have been killed through infection in the study
of zymotic diseases!</p>

<p>Count all the victims of professional diseases, of tuberculosis,
phosphorus necrosis, lead poisoning, mercurial poisoning, etc.!...
Count all those who have fallen from scaffoldings, all the sailors who
have been drowned, all the railway employees who have been run over,
all the factory hands who have been torn to pieces by machinery, all
those who have been destroyed in mines by explosions, etc.!</p>

<p>Think of the hunger and misery of the widows and children of these
victims of industry and science, of the loss of work and other social
injuries resulting from capitalism!</p>

<p>The rebellion of the victims of this system, again, gives rise to the
class war, with new tortures, new sufferings!... In order ultimately,
by the creation of a new social system in the future, to free
mankind from these sufferings!... People believe it! But that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page595">[595]</span>
<b>nonsense</b>! The sufferings will only assume a new <b>form</b>, and will
<b>increase</b>!!</p>

<p>Do you, then, believe that all the miseries of mankind at the present
time have been the result only of chance, not of <b>foresight</b>?</p>

<p>Oh, no! These sufferings were only the <b>stimulus</b> which drove
mankind forward to new construction, to greater progress, in order
to avoid suffering!... Progress brought new suffering, and so on.</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>Thus suffering is the civilizing factor of mankind! To free mankind
from suffering would mean to rob mankind of civilization.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p>Can we represent to ourselves a life of complete satisfaction?</p>

<p>No! Without suffering, the needs would be wanting which alone
provide the stimulus to progress!... Without suffering, we should
also be without enjoyment. For everything reaches our consciousness
only by means of its opposite.</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>To free us from torment means to rob us of pleasure.... But
then we should no longer have any interest in life!</b>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>Civilization is a union, a hermaphrodite structure, of pleasure and
pain&mdash;that is, masochism!!... The progress of mankind is only
possible by means of the masochistic principle.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Oh, cruel-sweet philosophy of Golgotha!! Eternally shalt thou
remain the Moira and Kismet of humanity!!!</b></p>

go too far!... Do everything with moderation and for a definite
end!... Never go too far, and never fall into extremes!&#8221;...</p>

<p>No!... Go forward with courage into the extreme!... Only
slothfulness, comfortableness, and cowardice are afraid of a Turkish
bath, with the subsequent cold douche!</p>

<p>But how the body softens under this <i>laisser faire et laisser passer</i>,
how it loses its power of resistance, accumulates substances which are

<p>According to this device I acted henceforward. To increase pain,
in order that pleasure might become greater!</p>

<p>An immeasurable love for humanity took possession of me now that
I had at length attained the point of view which so perfectly harmonized
with my individuality.... <b>I myself became equivalent to
humanity</b>; I felt the heart-beat of millions in myself. Their contradictory<span class="pagenum" id="Page596">[596]</span>
feelings were united in my own person. I felt equally capitalist
and proletarian; equally orthodox Christian and Catholic, Jew and
atheist; equally man and woman.</p>

<p>All the sorrows and joys in humanity I felt in myself, and I plunged
myself in them to the depths.</p>

<p>I wished to experience them all in my own spirit.... I studied
universal history, but with what perception!... I did not confine
myself to facts, but I turned to the persons of those who were acting;
I represented to myself all the misery of the crowd and the thought of
the crowd.</p>

<p>What intolerable pain all these provided for me! How I began to
love glorious humanity which suffered all that!</p>

<p>Now the moment had come! Now was the time quickly to plunge
into the extreme of life!... To plunge into all the sorrows of the
millions, and to increase them tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold!
To drink the voluptuous sensation which all experience in the paroxysm
of frenzy, and thus to become thoroughly man!!</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p>From now onwards I threw myself with enthusiasm into the arms of
the most extreme section of the anarchist movement. I gave up the
whole of my property to the support of newspapers, to the publication
of pamphlets, to the support of agitators, and so on. But, at the same
time, I remained in touch with the &#8220;upper ten thousand.&#8221; I travelled
through the principal countries of Europe and America, everywhere
forming associations, everywhere developing amid the receptive element
of the movement my most radical tendencies&mdash;in most cases
with good result.</p>

<p>(He now describes in detail his propagandist destructive activity,
especially in Spain.)</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile, in my home in Eastern Europe the revolutionary
tendency was continually gaining force; anarchism also became more
influential. I felt that there was the proper field for my further
activity.</p>

<p>Henceforward I lived partly in Paris and partly in Genf and
Z&uuml;rich, in order from these places to guide the movement in my
direction.</p>

<p>Among my own countrymen I soon found adherents to whom nothing
seemed too fantastic, nothing too radical.</p>

<p>Soon we were in possession of a small printing-office, with the aid
of which we issued leaflets, pamphlets, and newspapers.</p>

<p>These generally contained the same ideas: the working classes
should not bother themselves with political demands, such as &#8220;universal
suffrage,&#8221; &#8220;individual liberty,&#8221; and the like. For, even if all
these were to be gained, social oppression and exploitation would
remain unaltered: these are what they feel most deeply, and from
these evils all the others result. The working classes should rather
aim at the &#8220;social revolution,&#8221; they should undertake the &#8220;expropriation
of the expropriators.<span class="pagenum" id="Page597">[597]</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>In the newspapers and pamphlets we proved in a scientific manner
the justice of all forms of individual expropriation&mdash;robbery with
violence, theft, extortion, etc.; we conducted an attack on property;
we demanded the destruction of wealth, whether in private hands or
in the hands of the State, in order that its possession might be more
easily gained.</p>

<p>When the war between Japan and Russia broke out, we all felt that
the time for increased activity had now arrived&mdash;most of us moved to
Poland, Lithuania, or Bessarabia. A few only remained in Switzerland,
in order to keep a grip upon the organization in these parts.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p>For me there now began a period of frightful sufferings....
With frenzied haste, I seized all the possible news from the seat of
war; greedily I consulted the reports of great battles lasting for entire
weeks; I read of the dreadful storming of Port Arthur. All the horrible
details passed plainly before my eyes.</p>

<p>All the frightful tortures of the masses I represented in my imagination.
I saw how they stood in battle day after day; how they had
lost consciousness in consequence of hunger and thirst and fatigue,
and so went on fighting as mere automata. Ultimately they even
<b>forgot</b> to take nourishment, to drink, and to rest&mdash;they actually did
not any longer understand that they could free themselves from their
torture of hunger and thirst, could save their lives, by eating and
drinking&mdash;so they went on in a frenzy until they fell.</p>

<p>I was no longer capable of doing anything else than, with a swimming
head, with temples pulsating with fever, studying war reports.
Day and night these pictures were before me. Oh, if I could only
stand with them in this hell!... How I loved them, these people
who were capable of such grand actions!... I wished to call out
to them: &#8220;Be embraced, O millions! Receive the kiss of the whole
world!&#8221;... Yes, these are the true civilized nations!... To
what progress must these horrible sufferings give rise? What a
future for mankind! What joys to come!</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the whole of my property had been used up in the
revolutionary movement. The little money that was still available,
that we were still able to scrape together here and there, was necessarily
used for party purposes. I therefore suffered the most horrible
poverty&mdash;now in Warsaw, now in Lodz, Bialystok, Kiew, or Odessa.
... Most of our adherents were among the poor Jewish quarters of
these towns.</p>

<p>My earnings consisted of occasional work and occasional theft.
When there was nothing doing in either of these ways, I moved on
with a few of my own kind from one of our supporters to another....
These people divided with us the little they had.</p>

<p>It was a voluptuous joy to me, finally, to plunge into the uttermost
depths of misery which it is possible to reach.</p>

<p>It was an enormous victory to be able to live in such surroundings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page598">[598]</span>
What glorious torments I suffered, until I had overcome the disgust
and loathing which the whole environment produced in me! Everywhere
we were amidst horrible dirt.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the dirt and misery in which I saw these people
wallowing&mdash;or, precisely, because of these things&mdash;I began to love
them as hitherto I had loved no others.... When they told me of
the frightful persecutions which their people had endured as no other
had done, then I experienced an unnamable yearning to be one of
them; then I wondered at the enormous power with which, notwithstanding
all persecutions, amidst the most frightful misery which I
saw around me, yet they were able to be the most ardent revolutionists.</p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p>Everywhere now the revolution was in flood. We developed a
feverish activity in all our centres.... At first we had no very
great influence, but our emissaries were actively at work everywhere,
in order to convert our movement from a political one to a social
one, or at least to an economic one.</p>

<p>For this purpose we had provided a secret printing-press in Warsaw,
where we prepared the necessary leaflets. They were written by a
student, who was a genius in this speciality. No one understood as
well as he how to appeal to the instincts of the crowd. The moving
power of his style was incomparable.... He put the facts side by
side, illuminated them from the side that seemed to him most suitable,
and then drew his conclusions, which, in their simple convincing
logic, seemed irresistible. Then he turned to inflame fanaticism,
reminded us how, then and there, and there, and there, so many victims
had been sacrificed to the same idea; how, there and elsewhere, on
the barricades men had died for it, and had rather rotted in prison
than abandon their just demands. In this way he <b>always</b> succeeded
in moving the crowd.</p>

<p>It was very efficacious, also, to remind the people of all the little
tricks which had been played upon them by the manufacturers and
by the authorities; he drew their attention to the fact how they, who
had created everything, were actually not recognized as human beings,
far less as human beings with equal rights.... These proofs most
readily infuriated the proletarians to frenzy, and in some places, as
in Lagonsk, Tiflis, and Baku, we succeeded in turning the movement
in the economic direction. It was a great advantage that we had
associates everywhere, and we were quickly notified when the rain
was likely to begin, so that we could speedily move to another place.</p>

<p>In Tiflis the affair did not go as I wished; here the people were
only <b>too</b> practical.... They began neither to strike, nor to demolish,
nor to attack the soldiers.... No.... They simply said: &#8220;So
much wages do we want; then we shall work only for such a time;
and no commodity must rise in price.... Every one who will not
take part with us we shall shoot.&#8221;... All the inhabitants joined
them.... After a short time all this came to nothing.</p>

<p>Baku was more pleasing to me.... Here the petroleum-borers
made their demands, and as these were not agreed to within two days,
they set fire to 140 wells.... Then, to my great regret, the proprietors<span class="pagenum" id="Page599">[599]</span>
agreed to everything which had been demanded. I had been
so inhumanly glad to see my life-ideal fulfilled. It seemed as if the
situation was going to be such as I had often imagined....</p>

<p>A long time already had the religious and racial hatred between
the Armenians and the Tartars been inflamed to the uttermost. In
the whole of the Caucasus there was a bubbling as if in a witch&#8217;s
cauldron.... Naturally, I remained in Baku, in order to be ready
for what I hoped would happen there.</p>

<p>The whole population was at the uttermost point of tension; everything
seemed painfully uncertain; would the dance begin or not?...
I felt that it would only be necessary to throw a grain of sand into
machine, and in an instant it would lead to an avalanche....
I was possessed by a frightful excitement; this mental tension was
intolerable.... From minute to minute the horrible anxiety of
the undetermined increased in me, and the hellish desire still burned
within me; I longed that it might start at this very minute, so that,
at last, my nerve-destroying tension might be relieved.</p>

<p>Then I became possessed with a demoniacal idea: one only needed
to give the slightest little push at the right place, and the storm
would break.</p>

<p>Inwardly I shuddered at the idea of the horrible consequences;
and yet something within me drove me forward with an irresistible
force&mdash;finally, to close the switch, and to allow the current to pass
which must give rise to the explosion.... &#8220;It is only a kind of
benevolent midwifery,&#8221; something seemed to whisper in my ear.
&#8220;It must happen, in any case!... The sooner the storm breaks,
the better!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus I was subjected to a conflict of perceptions, which made me
quite irresponsible. I was hurled to and fro by momentary feelings
like a football. A single word from the other side would have produced
in me such a suggestion that I should have blindly done anything
I might have been asked to do.</p>

<p>My state resembled that of those people of whom Blanqui says:
&#8220;Paris at any moment contains 50,000 men who are ready at a wave
of the hand to shed blood for any cause.&#8221; It is indifferent to them,
he might have added, if it is for the cause of freedom or for the cause
of reaction.</p>

<p>This &#8220;destroy-everything mood,&#8221; which had so long been to me
a psychological riddle, I was now able to study in my own person,
as the result of an intensified masochistic predisposition.... At
the foundation of the whole hermaphroditic state, there lay nothing
else than the love of humanity.... An everyday humanity offers
us no new sensations.... We are only able to love when it is out
of the ordinary.... For this reason, we strive to see mankind in
pain and poverty&mdash;in order that we may love men more ardently;
to love them for that reason, because their misery provides for <b>us</b>
intense pain.</p>

<p>For days I wandered about, fighting within myself a frightful
spiritual battle.... I felt that the only alternatives were either to
bring about a catastrophe or suicide. To wait any longer was beyond
my powers. A chance must decide....</p>

<p>A kind of trance state had taken possession of my organism....
I knew nothing rightly: I did not know if everything around me was<span class="pagenum" id="Page600">[600]</span>
reality or only a dream!... Yes, I even doubted my own existence!...
At no moment did I know where I was, how I had
come there, what I had just been doing, what I really was.... I
remember only that suddenly I was walking in the street in deep
conversation with a man entirely unknown to me.... Our conversation
turned round the question, What was going to happen?...
Both of us were reserved, both on the watch; each seemed to
have the feeling&mdash;&#8220;He is seeing through me; I must not betray
myself!... Perhaps I shall be able to get something out of him!&#8221;...
Thus, we spoke with the most extreme caution about that which
each of us read in the soul of the other....</p>

<p>The passers-by stared at us; possibly we had been speaking rather
too loudly. It appeared to me that someone was following us in
order to listen to our conversation; we stopped, in order that this
person might be compelled to walk past us. It was an impudent
lad, in the years between boyhood and manhood; he stopped also,
with his hands in his trousers pockets, a few paces distant, and
listened to us with interest.... My companion was as much taken
aback as I was myself, and we both began to stammer. At the
moment a crowd of gapers had collected around us, hoping to hear
something of interest. We both became continually more confused;
my head began to swim, and I began to say something. It must
have been nonsense that I spoke, for my companion looked at me,
half astonished and half alarmed, and several persons in the crowd
began to titter. This made me suddenly lose my head more even
than before, and I began to get angry. Suddenly I shouted out to
my companion: &#8220;That will have the most frightful results; they
have cut off the Tartar&#8217;s feet and hands, and now the Tartars will
massacre the whole town!&#8221;... All those around me began to
talk to one another at once. &#8220;Cut off feet and hands!&#8221;... I had
turned the switch and the current had passed....</p>

<p>I do not know how I got home.... My landlady rushed to me
with the news: &#8220;The Tartars are going to burn the town to ashes,
and to murder all the Armenians. Some of them have had their feet
and hands cut off; their noses have been slit, their eyes cut out;
boiling oil has been poured into their ears.... The people are all
running away, or barricading themselves in their houses!&#8221;</p>

<h4>XIII.</h4>

<p>I did not see the beginning of the drama, for immediately after my
return home I fell into a death-like slumber, which lasted more than
fifty hours. No one could have kept about after such a spiritual
storm.... When I awoke, I was so weak that only with labour
could I move a few paces; my whole body trembled unceasingly....
I had absolutely no other desire but for repose.... After I had
somewhat recovered, I went to sleep again until the next morning.</p>

<p>Now I once more felt comparatively strong, although my arms and
legs still trembled. My hostess&mdash;a German woman, long ago deserted
in this town&mdash;gave me an account of the atrocities perpetrated by the
Tartars. As I went out, the town seemed to be dead. In the streets
there still lay numerous horrible, mutilated corpses; the shops were<span class="pagenum" id="Page601">[601]</span>
closed; here and there houses were demolished. As far as I could
learn, in <b>Tiflis</b> the Tartars had done even worse.... Here in Baku
they had fired the boring-wells of the Armenians; from these the fire
had spread to the rest, so that the entire petroleum industry was
ruined, and 10,000 men were out of work.</p>

<p>All this, however, made no impression on me. A frightful relaxation
and apathy had taken possession of me; I felt neither pain, nor
pleasure, nor sympathy. It was the reaction following the previous
hypertension of the nerves.</p>

<p>I cared no longer to stay here, and I resolved to return to Kiew,
and later to Warsaw or to Lodz.</p>

<h4>XIV.</h4>

<p>After a short stay in Rostow, on the Don, I reached Kiew, and
was received by the group with much joy. They had believed that I
had fallen in the massacre at Baku or Tiflis.</p>

<p>Our successes in Tiflis and Baku in the economic province, by
means of the economic terror, were now utilized at every opportunity;
they only regretted that, owing to the racial conflict, everything had
been once more destroyed.</p>

<p>During my absence there had been many changes here. In Odessa,
Kiew, Warsaw, Lodz, and Bialystok, successful &#8220;expropriations&#8221;
had been effected. These &#8220;new tactics&#8221; had not only been strikingly
successful in almost every case, but they had also attracted towards
us the sympathies of those who had hitherto not taken in much earnest
our influence upon the revolution.</p>

<p>These &#8220;expropriations&#8221; were carried out in various ways. For
example, by one of our associates, who was an official in the postal
service, we were kept informed when, anywhere in the neighbourhood
of the town, the post-office coach was to pass an isolated place, carrying
anything of considerable value. We then attacked it and
plundered it.</p>

<p>Or we sent out spies to learn when, in any great person&#8217;s house, or
in any bank, large sums of money would be on hand, and at what time
the fewest employees would be there. Armed to the teeth, we
crowded in, and demanded the surrender of the money, leaving in its
place a receipt with the dreaded imprint of our organization. It also
happened&mdash;as in Odessa&mdash;that a bomb was exploded in a business
locality. Every one ran up to see what had happened. Meanwhile,
one of our bands entered the place of business from behind and
plundered the safe.</p>

<p>What a quantity of intelligence, energy, perseverance, and knowledge
had to be employed, to render such enterprises possible! How
we had to watch for weeks, to form plans and reject them; how our
arrangements must be altered at the last moment, or the enterprise
entirely abandoned! Of this every one and no one can form an
idea for himself.</p>

<p>Here, at any rate, I do <b>not</b> propose to give a detailed description
of these affairs, because my sketches do not aim at giving a description
of the revolution, or of those who participated in it, but <b>simply and
solely to represent the motives of my own activity</b>: Therefore I describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page602">[602]</span>
my own <b>environment</b>, only in so far as it is necessary to do so for
the <b>understanding</b> of these <b>motives</b>.</p>

<p>These &#8220;expropriations&#8221; were, moreover, not an anarchist speciality,
for they were also undertaken by the other terrorist parties.</p>

<p>He, however, who believes that the revolutionaries employed this
money for their personal needs is grossly deceived. After, as before,
they remained in their miserable holes, eating rotten herrings and
going barefoot, in order not to destroy their union with the workmen,
and not to lose the latter&#8217;s confidence. The money was used solely
for revolutionary purposes&mdash;for providing weapons and printing-presses;
for the erection of laboratories for making bombs; for the
expenses of the journeys of smugglers and propagandists; for bribery;
and for the support of those who had been arrested, and of their
families&mdash;also the families of those who had been killed or wounded.</p>

<h4>XV.</h4>

<p>Soon after my return from Baku, I was transferred to Warsaw, in
order to take part in the May-day celebrations of 1905&mdash;these May-day
celebrations taking place according to the calendar of non-Russian
countries.</p>

<p>The war, the unceasing extensive strikes and disturbances, had
resulted everywhere in giving rise to horrible misery, which was
further increased by the political crisis and by the arrest of all branches
of industry.</p>

<p>All the misery of which I had always dreamed I now saw unceasingly
around me. It might be believed that at length my desires
would have obtained satisfaction! But this was not so. In the
same degree as that with which the poverty around me increased did
my sensibility, too, become blunted; I became accustomed to its
appearance; I regarded it as an everyday occurrence, as something
easily comprehensible.</p>

<p><b>Somewhat</b> more did I love and honour humanity on account of this
misery; but not to the extent of something beyond force, something
&#8220;superhuman,&#8221; which would have been necessary for my complete
satisfaction. Perhaps in Baku I should have experienced this superhuman
feeling, had it not been that at the decisive moment my body
gave way under the strain. Was that, perhaps, prearranged by
Nature? Has Nature imposed these limits upon an individual, in
order to prevent him from raising himself above the human standard?</p>

<p>Can it be that the state into which I fell at Baku resembled a
&#8220;syncope of the soul,&#8221; which ensued when my psychical state began
to verge upon the superhuman, in consequence of the torments around
me, just as bodily syncope renders us unconscious when physical pain
exceeds the limits of human capacity?</p>

<p>These questions now began to occupy me. I could only attain
certainty by means of experiment; and I must obtain certainty, even
if the half of humanity had to be sacrificed, as one sacrifices a rabbit
in an experiment.</p>

<p>Impatiently I awaited the first of May.... Perhaps that day
would bring me a solution of the riddle!... The workmen were
still undecided: should they demonstrate or not?... I began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page603">[603]</span>
urge them <b>in favour of</b> the demonstration; <b>my</b> reason is easy to understand....</p>

<p>It was unquestionably one of the largest demonstrations that
Warsaw had ever witnessed. In the narrow streets there was packed
an innumerable crowd. Suddenly from all sides the soldiers charged
the demonstration.... A frightful panic&mdash;such as I have never
before seen&mdash;seized the crowd. Resistance was not to be thought
of&mdash;it was a <i>sauve qui peut</i>!</p>

<p>In mad fear of death, every one began to scream, and to seek refuge
in the houses.... At the doors of the houses there ensued a frightful
pressure. Many were thrown to the ground; these were trodden to
pulp. On the ground-floor the windows were broken in, and people
crawled through them into the houses. Meanwhile, the Cossacks
were raging up and down, cutting people down with their sabres.
There were deafening screams of fear, and with these and with the
groans of the wounded there mingled the bestial &#8220;S&uuml;iy&#8221; of the
Cossacks, so as to produce a nerve-lacerating concert of hell. And
around one could see the unnaturally dilated pupils, the widely opened
eyes, and the faces distracted with anxiety, of those who were seeking
safety in flight.</p>

<p>The same excitement had seized on me also; with a wildly beating
heart, and an unbearably distressing feeling of contracture in the
loins, which produced in my entire organism a kind of &#8220;anxious
ecstasy,&#8221; I began to hope.... But it would not come....</p>

<h4>XVI.</h4>

<p>In Odessa, which was exhausted by unceasing fights and strikes,
the strength of the reaction began to make itself felt, and there were
fears of a &#8220;pogrom&#8221; (an attack on the Jews). The forces of the
reaction in these pogroms always made use of the Lumpenproletariat
(the blackguardly element of the mob).</p>

<p>Since the most trustworthy of our Odessa associates were Jews, and
thus had no influence with the Lumpenproletariat, they urged me to
go to Odessa, and, as a non-Hebrew, to use my influence to prevent
the pogrom. It was not possible for me to refuse, although in secret
I rejoiced at the prospect of the pogrom.</p>

<p>In Kiew, where I had some business, I met by chance an acquaintance
belonging to my more prosperous past. This man knew nothing
of my revolutionary activities. He, for his part, was an arch anti-Semite.
In consequence of the disturbances, his business had been
completely ruined. He described the whole revolution as the work
of the Jews, and also abused the Government, which, in his opinion,
was to blame for the weakness which it exhibited in dealing with
the revolutionary forces.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he continued, with a wink, &#8220;if the Government does
nothing, we shall know how to help ourselves a little!&#8221; I pretended
to be entirely of his opinion, and he told me in confidence that there
already existed in Odessa a secret committee, which was to take the
matter in hand. He also was a member. A large sum of money had
already been collected, in order to pay certain persons who were
to arrange the entire &#8220;Hetze.&#8221; If I wished, I could be his guest,
and he would make me a member of the committee. I agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page604">[604]</span></p>

<p>The next day I was actually enrolled in the committee. Who the
members really were I did not learn. One characteristic was common
to them all&mdash;a frightful indolence.... Everything was ready.
They would arrange for patriotic demonstrations, and would then
throw proclamations amongst the people, to tell them that the Jews
had sworn an oath to combine with the Japanese for the destruction
of Holy Russia; that the revolution had been begun by the Jews
in order that the Little Father&#8217;s army must meet enemies on both
sides at once. Thus, for all the present misery the Jews only were
to blame, etc.... Everything had been arranged already, and was
in the hands of people who were prepared to undertake the whole
affair. The only thing now wanting was the proclamation.</p>

<p>My acquaintances now began to praise my genius as an author, and
they all pressed me to begin immediately to compose the required
leaflet. The proposal suited me; I do not need to say why. With
zeal I threw myself upon the task, and the proclamation was a masterpiece
of demagogic art, and a crowning example of the &#8220;appeal to
the beast in man,&#8221; as it is ordinarily called.</p>

<p>The diffusion of this &#8220;document of civilization,&#8221; as it is called by
the revolutionists, took place in connexion with the planned demonstration.
The day passed without an outbreak, although the imminence
of the storm could, as one may say, be felt in the air. Not
until the evening were a few Jews beaten here and there.</p>

<p>On the second day our people arranged for a second demonstration.
From the other side they endeavoured to form a counter-demonstration,
and the two came in conflict. The Black Hundreds (drawn from
the Lumpenproletariat), who fought in the name of &#8220;patriotism,&#8221;
dispersed the counter-demonstrators, and began to demolish and to
plunder in the Jewish quarter of the town.</p>

<p>The breaking of the panes of glass, and the destruction of the goods
in the shop-windows and of the furniture in the houses, seemed to
inflame the crowd more and more; they must have experienced a
sort of voluptuous sensation in connexion with these activities.
Finally, they found some Jews who had hidden themselves. A
horrible yell was now raised. The Jews were dragged out into the
street; they were struck with everything available&mdash;with cudgels,
hatchets, and knives&mdash;until they were completely unrecognizable.
The crowd found more and more of them. Most of them threw themselves
on their knees and begged for life; it was most horrible to see
them, beaten till their features were no longer distinguishable, still
pleading for mercy. Now the mob really began to smell blood,
and to display its whole true human nature. Each began to murder
according to his own individual fancy. Here a man cut the breast
from a nursing mother; there they tore the clothes from some girls,
and flogged them naked through the streets. In another place they
dragged a Jewess, naked, from her house into the street, tied her hand
and foot, and fastened her by the hair to the axle of a cab; then they
drove off at a gallop until she was battered to death. Behind the
cab there ran street-arabs, striking at her body.... But to what
purpose is it to describe these scenes, at which one&#8217;s heart is convulsed
in one&#8217;s body with sorrow, and simultaneously one wishes to
exult with joy and triumph?</p>

<p>Here I saw once more, in their proper environment, the 50,000 of<span class="pagenum" id="Page605">[605]</span>
whom Blanqui speaks. A wave of the hand would have sufficed&mdash;although
99 per cent, of them unquestionably felt no hostility towards
the Jews&mdash;to produce in all of them the most infernal anti-Semitic
excesses. If the police would allow it, as they allow the pogrom,
another wave of the hand would direct the mob with no less ease
to make an attack on another human variety&mdash;for example, on the
capitalists.</p>

<p>What psychological factor drove them on?... Was it simply a
tendency to cruelty?... No!... A love of cruelty considered by itself,
without a nobler motive, is inhuman, inharmonious to human nature,
and man <b>cannot</b> escape his own nature. There must therefore be
other motives at the basis of such actions, motives of a nature more
humanly comprehensible.</p>

<p>But look at all those slaughterers! Regard their physiognomy!
Not a trace of cruelty&mdash;only suffering, <b>unheard-of</b> suffering, is reflected
on these faces!... The fear of death and the pain of their
victims prepares for <b>themselves</b> incredible torment!... Do you
not believe that these people will return to their houses, and will
suffer intense mental pain?... They will continually see, in
imagination, the last beseeching glance of their victim, full of complaint
and reproach, directed upon them!... What hatred, what
contempt, will they feel for the animal which has awakened within
them! They will feel a longing to spit in their own faces, to strike
themselves, to strangle themselves!... Before every one whom
they meet they will lower their eyes: &#8220;He knows that I have
murdered people, amid the most cruel tortures, against whom there
was no hatred in my heart&mdash;murdered only for this reason: because I
had within me the instinctive demand for spiritual torment; because
by the situation in which I suddenly found myself one pole of my
hermaphrodite nature was suddenly discharged!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are <b>masochists</b>, only they do not know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Self-contempt suddenly seized me amidst this Satanic orgy of
suffering on the part of such <b>unconscious, instinctive masochists</b>. The
remembrance that all these persons were being led onwards by a blind
animal impulse, and that to-morrow they would fall on their knees
before their God and pray to Him for pardon, filled me with disgust.
I began to hate this stupid mass. I wanted to see them grovel in the
dust themselves, and howl for mercy.</p>

<p>For this purpose it was only necessary to organize the <i>Selbstschutz</i>
(a union for the prevention of persecution of the Jews). In order to
effect this, I tried to get into the Jewish quarter. I succeeded in
doing so by means of some side passages. Hardly had I reached
this quarter, when I came across masses of these &#8220;Self-Protectors.&#8221;
Finally, I found among them some acquaintances, and I joined them.</p>

<p>A heated contest now began to rage.... As the Black Hundreds
were now so energetically attacked, all their heroism was speedily at
an end: they took to flight. At this moment the soldiers appeared&mdash;not,
as one might have imagined, to attack the Black Hundreds, but
to attack the &#8220;Self-Protectors.&#8221;</p>

<p>My arm, which was stretched out in front of me, was traversed
longitudinally by a rifle-bullet in a peculiar manner. I sank to the
ground at first, but soon recovered sufficiently to get up and run
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page606">[606]</span></p>

<p>That inexpressible sense of complete satisfaction by means of
suffering, for which I was continually searching&mdash;which, so to say, I
felt to slumber within me&mdash;once more appeared in actual experience.
I always had the impression that there was something wanting, that
it was necessary to awaken something within me which hitherto had
existed in my consciousness only in a dormant state.... At the
same time, a voice whispered to me that I was demanding something
superhuman; that the attainment of such a thing must logically overwhelm
my purely <b>human</b> powers, and that it would involve my
annihilation.</p>

<p>Day and night these thoughts tormented me: &#8220;You <b>must</b> gain this
experience&mdash;even if it involves your destruction!... But what if,
at the last moment&mdash;as at Baku&mdash;a further incapacity, a &#8216;spiritual
syncope,&#8217; ensues?&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing I knew&mdash;&#8220;When you reach it, it will only be by yourself;
all others will break to pieces <b>before</b> you!&#8221;</p>

<h4>XVII.</h4>

<p>I no longer had any interest in the development of revolutionary
affairs, since for <b>my own</b> purposes they were no longer serviceable.</p>

<p>The new questions which now arose&mdash;as, for example, the propaganda
among the Lumpenproletariat&mdash;left me cold.... In the
pogrom we had seen what an unawakened force&mdash;reputed as revolutionary,
but in reality <b>masochistic</b>&mdash;was slumbering in the Lumpenproletariat.
That this force could also be used in the service of
reaction was ascribed to the fact that all these thieves, criminals,
and prostitutes, came into contact only with the working classes.
But since they earn from the latter nothing but contempt, their
sensibility was turned <b>against</b> the working classes.</p>

<p>This unfortunate state of affairs it was proposed to counteract by
going among the criminals, just as in earlier years they had gone
among the working people. An endeavour was made to organize the
Lumpenproletariat, in order to win their sympathies.</p>

<p>The movement was in part successful, although it brought with it
much corruption. Thus it happened that the criminals endeavoured
to turn the matter to their own advantage, and began to pursue
their profession in the name of anarchism. For example, in Warsaw
they visited the house of an enormously rich Jewish banker, whose
father had recently died, and, under the mask of anarchism, demanded
from him 10,000 roubles, with the threat that if he did not give the
money, they would dig up the corpse of his father and bury it in
unconsecrated ground. When we remember there is nothing more
horrible for an orthodox Jew than to rest in unconsecrated soil, we
shall understand that the banker gave the money; but this occurrence
aroused a great sensation, and people began to identify anarchists
with common criminals.</p>

<p>Now the anarchists had to endure the persecution, not only of the
Government, but also that of other revolutionary parties and of the
Lumpenproletariat&mdash;the latter for this reason: because they did not
wish their names to be associated with actions which were undertaken
for personal advantage, and not for revolutionary aims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page607">[607]</span></p>

<p>This campaign against the anarchists from three different sides
must soon bring about disaster.</p>

<p>During this time I was perpetually puzzling over the problem:
&#8220;Will the idea you have dreamed of be realized within you?...
Will it lead to your destruction?... Or will it overwhelm your
powers, and lead once more to spiritual syncope?&#8221;</p>

<p>By means of an experiment, the matter could be determined!...
Supposing one were to distribute broadcast plague bacilli!... If
entire towns were to suffer from this disease!... If the fear of
death was to seize the whole crowd of those who, in their cowardice
at every strike, every demonstration, every fight at the barricades,
had hidden behind the stove or crept under the bed!... If this
fear of death were to increase to a general panic, affecting entire towns,
entire countries, as happened in the middle ages!... If the people,
in their despair, should look for the disseminators of the trouble, and
should proceed to hew one another to pieces!... Would my relief
come then?... Will there be an <b>answer</b> for me?</p>

<p>I shudder to think of the suffering which this would entail for me!
I feel that I am not equal to this!... I suffer, on the other hand,
inexpressibly, because I have no answer, no recognition, no satisfaction!...
I will&mdash;and I cannot. To endure longer this hermaphroditic
state&mdash;this is death or lunacy!... What to do?...
How to free oneself from this horrible dilemma?</p>

<p>Oh, why am I not like others?... Why cannot I simply accept
<b>that which is</b>?... Why do I torment myself to climb the mountain,
in order to stand before a bottomless abyss?... Before an
abyss whose secret depths will be manifest to me only if I hurl myself
into it!...</p>

<p>What to do?... What to do?... Shall I, or shall I not?...
I <b>will</b>!... I <b>must</b>!...</p>

<p>As I was about to do it, I was arrested! Chance or foresight?</p>

<p>Oh, fate, fate! <b>That</b> is too much of suffering!... Oh, mankind,
mankind, what have you done?... A single one wished to <b>see</b>. A
single one wished to tear a veil from the image&mdash;and you have hindered
it!... Eternally you will have darkness around you!... But
why will you not allow me to see the light?</p>

<p>Is it thus that you thank <b>me</b>, who have loved humanity as no other
has loved!</p>

<p>Yes; that is once over again the cruel, the pitiless philosophy of
Golgotha&mdash;</p>

<p class="center highline2">&#8220;<b>He who will love&mdash;must suffer!</b>&#8221;</p>

This is a favourite masochistic situation. Hans Baldung has immortalized
it in a picture, in which Phyllis rides upon Aristotle. I owe to the kindness of
my colleague Dr. Kantorowicz, in Hanover, the knowledge that J. von Falke
describes an ivory relief representing the same scene. King Alexander looks on,
and &#8220;rejoices at the scene&mdash;how the bearded old man, controlled by the beauty,
with the bit in his mouth, is crawling about on all-fours, carrying the lady, armed
with a whip.&#8221; In Semrau-L&uuml;bke&#8217;s &#8220;Elements of the History of Art,&#8221; vol. iii.,

The following extremely valuable contribution to the psychology of the
Russian revolution now in progress was sent in September, 1906, from Russia
to my colleague Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. He most kindly gave me this extremely
interesting sketch for publication in this place. It throws a very clear light
upon the nature of algolagnia. We have here a unique psychological document,
which deserves the attention of politicians and sociologists no less than that
of anthropologists and psychologists.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p class="noindent">Like algolagnia, <b>sexual fetichism</b> rests upon a physiological basis,
and is merely a more or less abnormal increase of fetichistic
ideas and perceptions, which are rooted in the very nature of
the sexual attraction.</p>

<p>By fetichism (derived from the Portuguese <i>feitico</i> Italian
<i>fetisso</i>&mdash;magic, charm) we understand the limitation of love,
its transference from the entire personality to a <b>portion</b> of this
personality, or, it may be, to some <b>lifeless</b> physical object <b>related</b>
to the <span class="nowrap">personality.<a id="FNanchor627"></a><a href="#Footnote627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></span>
This fascinating &#8220;portion&#8221; of the beloved
personality, or the &#8220;object&#8221; associated with this personality,
is the sexual &#8220;fetich.&#8221; Within physiological limits, the part
concerned exercises a particular attraction, and is especially
exciting, but in the ideas of the lover it remains associated
with the entire personality to which it belongs. Fetichism first
becomes abnormal, or pathological, when the partial representation
becomes completely divorced from the general representation
of the personality, so that, for example, a plait of hair or a
pocket-handkerchief is loved alone and by itself, disconnected
from the person to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>The development of love can always be referred to fetichistic
ideas, for when we examine critically the first general impression
which the beloved makes upon the lover, we always find that
there are certain <b>parts</b> or <b>functions</b> which have made the <b>greatest</b>
impression, and have exercised a greater erotic influence than
other portions. To the former of these, therefore, the imagination
and the sensibility more especially <b>cleave</b>. In my &#8220;Contributions
to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis&#8221; (vol. ii.,
p. 311), I defined sexual fetiches as peculiar <b>symbols</b> of the
<b>essence</b> of the beloved personality, with which the idea of the
entire type is most readily associated. M. Hirschfeld later
enunciated the same views.</p>

<p>As sexual fetiches we may have: (1) <b>Portions of the body</b>;
(2) <b>functions and emanations of the body</b>; and (3) <b>objects which
have any kind of relation to the body</b>.</p>

<p>Under (1) we may enumerate the hand, the foot, the nose,
the ears, the eyes, the hair of the head, the hair of the beard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page612">[612]</span>
the throat and the back of the neck, the breasts, the hips, the
genital organs, the buttocks, the calves. All these parts may
constitute sexual fetiches.</p>

<p>The same is true of all the influences enumerated under (2)&mdash;viz.,
gait, movement, voice, glance, odour, complexion.</p>

<p>Under (3) we may enumerate the clothing as a <b>whole</b> (as
costume) and in its individual parts, upper-clothing and underclothing,
hat, eyeglasses, way of dressing the hair, necktie, bodice,
corset, chemise, petticoat, stockings, shoes or boots, apron, handkerchief,
clothing materials (fur, satin, silk), the colour of
clothing (mourning, parti-coloured blouses, white clothing,
uniform), fashion (<i>cul de Paris</i>, <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> and <i>retrouss&eacute;</i>, <i>tricot</i>);
indeed, clothing fetichism goes so far that a particular shape of
the heel of the shoe, a particular mode of ornamentation of some
particular part of the clothing, and, finally, any striking part of
the clothing, may become a sexual fetich.</p>

<p>This fetichistic influence is further increased by a peculiar
characteristic of human love. This is its tendency towards
<b>idealization</b>, <b>beautification</b>, and <b>enlargement</b> of those parts which
especially affect the senses. This beautification and idealization
extends from the body to the clothing, and to articles in general,
used by the beloved person, but normally remains associated
with the entire personality. It is first by means of the enlargement
and accentuation of a distinct part that this becomes
separated from the general idea, and thus its removal and conversion
into a &#8220;fetich&#8221; is prepared for. In the chapter on
clothing we drew attention to this general anthropological
phenomenon of the enlargement and accentuation of many parts
by means of such measures as painting, articles of clothing,
exposure, way of doing the hair, etc.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as now, by the ideal and actual accentuation of the
part under consideration, it is projected as a more independent
structure, and separates itself from the personality as a whole,
it is involuntarily <b>isolated</b> in idea by the fetichist, and becomes
<b>generalized</b> to constitute an independent stimulus, which may
now, temporarily or permanently, completely take the place of
the personality as a whole.</p>

<p>This physiological process embraces both the &#8220;lesser&#8221; and
the &#8220;greater&#8221; fetichism of Binet.</p>

<p>The lesser fetichism consists in this: that the lover, without
going so far as to lose sight completely of the entire person of
his beloved, still directs his attention to <b>individual</b> special charms,
or is in general first attracted to the beloved woman by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page613">[613]</span>
of <b>quite distinct qualities</b>, such as the shape and smallness of
the hand, the colour and sparkling of the eyes, the abundance
and softness of the hair, the complexion, a distinct odour, a
melodious voice, etc. In the &#8220;lesser&#8221; fetichism the partial
representation plays, indeed, a very prominent part in the
general picture, but does not entirely obliterate this picture.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;greater&#8221; fetichism, on the other hand, a particular
portion, or function, or quality, or an article of clothing, or an
object of customary use belonging to the beloved person, is
isolated from this latter, and in a sense becomes transformed
into the latter, and assumes wholly and completely the character
of a being capable by itself of exercising a sexually exciting
influence. This is genuine sexual fetichism.</p>

<p>Binet and von Schrenck-Notzing have referred the genesis of
fetichism, as a rule, to some <b>chance occurrence</b> during childhood&mdash;to
a fetichistic impression which chanced to coincide with sexual
excitement, and thus obtained a permanently sexual coloration.
The time of puberty and the first sexual relationships are
especially dangerous for the formation of such associations of
ideas. Von Schrenck-Notzing rightly draws attention to the
fact that this perverse associative connexion, as a reaction to
powerful external impressions, does not occur only, as Binet
assumes, in predisposed individuals, but is also <b>quite peculiarly
characteristic of the childish mental life at the time when the
brain is undergoing growth, as well as of the less-developed intellectual
powers of savage races</b>, among whom at the present time,
in quite other provinces than the sexual, fetichism is cultivated in
the most excessive manner; thus, fetichism is often manifested by
persons with perfectly normal brains. Such chance occurrences
for the origination of sexual fetichism occur in games, in reading,
in solitary and mutual masturbation. Nearly always, in connexion
with the genesis of fetichism, we can prove that there has
been some such actual predisposing cause.</p>

<p>In numerous cases of the &#8220;greater&#8221; fetichism, especially in the
category of the hair fetichists (&#8220;plait-cutters&#8221;), shoe fetichists,
and handkerchief fetichists, there is also associated a more or
less severe psychopathic constitution, on the foundation of which
the fetichistic impulse has developed as a kind of &#8220;<b>coercive idea</b>&#8221;
(obsession). These are the cases which have the greatest forensic
importance, and which gain publicity.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to give a brief account of the most
important forms of sexual fetichism, and those most frequently
encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page614">[614]</span></p>

<p>First of all, <b>parts</b>, <b>functions</b>, and <b>qualities</b> of the body may
constitute sexual fetiches; the possibilities in this respect,
extending from head to foot, have been enumerated above.
Moreover, odd as it may sound, the <b>entire human being</b> may also
become a sexual fetich, not as a whole personality&mdash;that would
be normal love&mdash;but as a <b>national</b> or <b>racial</b> individual. In such
a case we have the so-called &#8220;<b>racial fetichism</b>.&#8221; The European
newspapers are full of interesting reports of the peculiar attractive
force exercised by exotic individuals, female or male, such as
negroes, Arabs, Abyssinians, Moors, Indians, Japanese, etc.,
upon European men and women respectively. Whenever
members of such races come to stay in any European capital,
we hear of remarkable love affairs between white girls and these
strangers, of romantic abductions, and other mad adventures.
The novelty, peculiarity, piquancy of the strange races has the
effect of a fetich. The size, the figure, the physiognomy, tint of
skin, smell, tattooing, adornment, costume, speech, dance, and
song, of these savage men exercise a fascinating influence.
White men have from very early times had a peculiar weakness
for negroes and for mulatto women and girls. As early as the
eighteenth century there existed in Paris negro brothels; and
somewhat later, after Napoleon&#8217;s Egyptian expedition, negroes
and negresses came in large numbers to Paris, and were utilized
for the gratification of the lusts of both sexes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the deeply-rooted racial hatred, even in
America racial fetichism gives rise to numerous connexions of this
kind. The &#8220;coloured girl&#8221; exercises a powerful attractive force
upon the American man; and even the proud American woman
manifests, with an especial frequency in Chicago, a certain preference
for the male <span class="nowrap">negro.<a id="FNanchor628"></a><a href="#Footnote628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></span>
But much greater is the alluring force
exercised by the white upon the negro. More especially among
civilized negroes does the white woman play the part of a fetich.
This is the explanation of the frequent rape, or attempted rape,
of white girls on the part of negroes&mdash;one of the principal causes
of the Southern lynchings.</p>

<p>Among the parts of the body which act as fetiches, we
have especially to mention the hair of woman&#8217;s head. &#8220;<b>Hair
fetichism</b>&#8221; is widely diffused, both in the physiological &#8220;lesser&#8221;
form and in the pathological &#8220;greater&#8221; form. The abundance
and the colour of the hair have an equal influence in normal
love also as a &#8220;fetich.&#8221; Hair, &#8220;of sweetest flesh, the tenderest,
Sweetest growth,&#8221; as Eduard Grisebach terms it in his &#8220;Neue<span class="pagenum" id="Page615">[615]</span>
Tanh&auml;user,&#8221; has a profound sexual significance; with primitive
man, also, it probably played the same r&ocirc;le of a sexually stimulating
&#8220;veil&#8221; which was later played by tattooing and clothing.
The hair of the head, and special modes of arranging that hair,
play an important part in sexual selection among the savage
races. The odour of the hair also has a sexually stimulating
influence, and remains persistent in the imagination. The softness
also of the hair, the waving, curling movement of woman&#8217;s
loosened hair, and the rustling of the hair, excite the imagination.
But most important of all is the colour of the hair; and in this
respect <b>blonde</b> or reddish-blonde hair unquestionably takes the
first rank as a sexual fetich. Blonde hair exercised such an
influence in the days of the Roman Empire. The demi-monde
of all times has utilized this form of hair fetichism, felt by men,
for its own purposes, either by dyeing the hair a fair colour, or by
the wearing of fair-haired wigs. There exist, also, fetichistic
impulses towards brown, black, and red hair respectively. Jon
Lehmann tells (<i>Breslauer Zeitung</i>, August 24, 1906) of a great
libertine who was happy with any or all pretty girls, as long as
they had not red hair and were not the daughters of clergymen.
Innumerable times had he made this assertion. Many years
later Lehmann found him as the happy husband of&mdash;a red-haired
clergyman&#8217;s daughter! &#8220;C&#8217;est l&#8217;amour qui a fait cela,&#8221; he
answered laconically to the astonished question why he had been
so unfaithful to the principles of his youth.</p>

<p>Hair fetichism manifests itself in various ways. Many people
are, properly speaking, rather smell fetichists than hair fetichists;
they content themselves simply with smelling the hair, and this
constitutes their only, or their principal, sexual gratification.
Other hair fetichists obtain sexual enjoyment by looking at the
hair, or by passing the fingers through it. The following case,
reported by Archenholtz (&#8220;England and Italy,&#8221; vol. i., p. 448;
Leipzig, 1785), is typical:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I was acquainted with an Englishman who was an honourable
man; but he had a very peculiar taste, which, as he frequently assured
me, was deeply rooted in his soul. His greatest pleasure, which alone
could intoxicate his senses, was to comb the hair of a beautiful woman.
He kept a very handsome mistress for this purpose only. <b>Love and
woman did not, in the ordinary sense, come under consideration; he
had nothing to do except with her hair.</b> In the hours that suited him,
she must take down her hair and let him pass his hands through it.
This operation produced in him the most intense degree of physical
voluptuousness.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page616">[616]</span></p>

<p>The most remarkable class of hair-fetichists are the so-called
&#8220;<b>plait-cutters</b>.&#8221; The transition to this morbid state depends
upon the custom, widely diffused in earlier times, of cutting off
and preserving locks of hair as erotic fetiches. This sexual
reliquary cult flourished especially in the eighteenth century,
during the period of &#8220;sentiment.&#8221; Friedrich S. Krauss reports
(&#8220;Anthropophyteia,&#8221; vol. i., p. 163) that among the Southern
Slavs young men and women gave one another tufts of pubic
hair as sexual fetiches. The &#8220;wig-collectors&#8221; also belong to
the category of harmless hair fetichists. More serious are the
genuine &#8220;plait-cutters&#8221;&mdash;persons who are accustomed to cut
plaits of hair from the heads of girls, who are happy in
the possession of these plaits, and who obtain sexual gratification
simply by looking at and touching them. These plait-cutters
are almost unquestionably pathological individuals, who
act under the influence of coercive impulses. Recently, in
Berlin, two such cases attracted public attention. The judicial
proceedings connected with the former of these cases elicited
such interesting details regarding the development, psychology,
and activity of plait fetichism that it is worth preserving, and is
therefore given here at length, quoted from a report in the
<i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, No. 118, of March 6, 1906.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<h4><span class="smcap">Perversities before the Law Courts.</span></h4>

<p>The plait-cutter whose arrest attracted so much attention appeared
yesterday in the Assessor&#8217;s Court, under the presidency of the judicial
assessor F&ouml;rster. The accused, Robert S., was a student of the
Technical High School at Charlottenburg. The accused was prosecuted
and defended by counsel. He was born at Valparaiso in the year
1883. The accusation was that, between the months of November
and January last, he had, in sixteen cases, in the public streets,
cut plaits of hair from the heads of young girls, taking also the
ribbons with which their hair was tied; this charge was one of theft.
In twelve cases also he was accused of bodily maltreatment and actual
injury. Two medical experts were present to advise the court.
During the inquiry the public was excluded from the court, but the
representatives of the Press were admitted.</p>

<p>The accused replied to the inquiries of the President, that he had
come to Germany in the year 1888, and that he had been at school in
Thorn, Bergedorf, and Hamburg. In Hamburg he had passed his
final examination, and had received a good report on leaving. He
had always had a special fondness for mathematics; he had studied
for one term at Munich. He had always worked very hard. He
admitted that in sixteen cases he had cut plaits of hair from the
heads of girls in the streets of Berlin. In his rooms <b>thirty-one plaits</b>
had been found.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Had you such tendencies in earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page617">[617]</span>
years?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: Yes; at the age of sixteen years I secretly, one
evening, cut some hair from the head of my sister, thirteen years of
age, and kept it. I have always had a desire for beautiful long hair;
finally, this desire became so strong that I was unable to resist it any
longer. The first time that I cut some hair from the head of a girl
was the day of the entrance of the Crown Princess. I do not know
why I suddenly was unable to resist the impulse. It became
more powerful after I returned from a journey to South America,
which I made as a voluntary machinist. The voyage lasted
five months. I had worked very hard while on board. During the
whole voyage I was in a gloomy mood, and when I returned the
impulse became continually greater.&mdash;<i>President</i>: In what way did the
impulse affect you?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: I frequently ran after little girls
without being able to gratify the desire to possess their hair. Then
I succeeded, amid the crowd at the entrance festivities Unter den
Linden, to cut some loose hair from the head of a girl with a pair of
scissors, without the girl becoming aware of it.&mdash;<i>President</i>: What did
you do with the hair?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: Nothing at all.&mdash;<i>President</i>: What
did you think about while you where doing it?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: Nothing.
I simply put the hair into my pocket.&mdash;<i>President</i>: And afterwards?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>:
Several times Unter den Linden I cut loose hair from girls&#8217;
heads.&mdash;<i>President</i>: When did you begin to cut off entire plaits?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>:
In November, at the entrance of the King of Spain. Then,
in the &#8220;Opernplatz,&#8221; I cut a plait from the head of a child; the girl
did not notice it, and I remained quiet. The plait was fastened with
ribbon.&mdash;<i>President</i>: What did you do with the plait?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: I
took it home, combed it, and put it in a box on my writing-table, on
which was the inscription &#8220;Mementoes.&#8221; I afterwards frequently
<b>took the hair out and kissed it</b>. Often I laid it on my pillow and rested
my head on it.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Were you not fully aware that you were
doing something wrong, and that you were interfering profoundly
with the rights of another individual?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: I did not think
about it.&mdash;<i>President</i>: If the proceedings were now to come to an end,
and if you were discharged, would you do the same thing again?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>:
I do not think that I should do it again, now that I have
experienced what the consequences are.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Can you give
security that in the future your will will be stronger than the impulse?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>:
I cannot give any guarantee.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Have you never
read in the papers that the citizens of Berlin were very much agitated
by this cutting off of girls&#8217; hair?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: I have read nothing of
the kind.&mdash;<i>President</i>: When were you arrested?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: On
January 27. From a girl whose hair was plaited in two plaits I cut one
plait; when she came near me again, I wanted to cut off the other
plait, and then I was arrested.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Is it true that you put a
ribbon round each plait of hair, and marked it with the date you had
cut it off?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: To some extent I did so.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Have you
ever had sexual relations with woman?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: No, never. I have
only had a strong impulse to gain possession of beautiful long hair.&mdash;<i>President</i>:
Would not long beautiful men&#8217;s hair have satisfied you as
well?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: Yes.&mdash;<i>Counsel for the Defence</i>: Did you not have
this morbid impulse in quite early youth? You told me that you
remembered the hair of many girls from the time that you were at
school in Thorn. At that time you were eight years old. You said<span class="pagenum" id="Page618">[618]</span>
to me that you had thought no more about the persons to whom the
hair belonged, but only, and all the more, about their hair.&mdash;<i>Accused</i>:
That is correct. It is indifferent to me whether the person to whom
the hair belonged is young and beautiful or old and ugly: my only
interest is in the hair.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Have you the same interest in
white hair?&mdash;<i>Accused</i>: My attraction is only to fair hair.&mdash;In reply
to a further question on the part of the President, the accused declared
that he had been a very active member of the academic gymnastic
club, and that he belonged to a students&#8217; purity alliance.&mdash;<i>Counsel
for the Defence</i>: The accused has stated that, while he is at work, it
often happens that suddenly plaits of hair seem to appear before his
eyes. He often has reveries in which it seems to him that in all
countries women and girls with beautiful hair are at his disposal,
and that he is able to rob them of their hair. Among his colleagues
the accused has always felt himself to be thrust into the background.
He had the feeling that he was <b>destined for great things</b>, and that his
comrades would not recognize this. The accused, whose father is dead,
had received assistance for his studies; his brother is an officer at sea;
one of his sisters is mentally disordered.&mdash;Of the witnesses who had
been summoned to attend, three only were examined. Captain
von W., whose daughter, when walking in the Leipzigerstrasse, had
been robbed of part of her hair by the accused, gave evidence that
the affair had had very disagreeable consequences to his daughter.
Since that time the child had suffered from a terrible feeling of anxiety;
she had experienced a nervous shock, and frequently cried out
anxiously in the middle of the night, because she was dreaming of the
plait-cutter.&mdash;The next witness, Frau Gall, an old acquaintance of
the family of the accused, described his character as exceptionally
good. All who knew him had been astonished to hear of his actions;
no one who knew him had ever observed this passion for hair. Recently
he had obviously been overstrained mentally, and very distrait;
generally speaking, he was not high-spirited and happy, like other
young fellows. According to further evidence given by this witness,
regarding the family history, it appeared that the accused was affected
with congenital taint.&mdash;Undergraduate Schmeding, President of &#8220;the
Alliance for the Maintenance of Chastity,&#8221; had become intimately
acquainted with the accused, in consequence of their holding similar
views. He described him as having a good character, but as dreamy,
melancholy, and reserved, and unfamiliar with harmless cheerfulness
and joy.&mdash;Dr. Hoffmann, one of the medical advisers to the court,
said: We have in this case to do with a peculiar mode of activity of
the sexual impulse. Although such an impulse does not completely
abrogate responsibility, still, in this case, normal responsibility is greatly
limited from early youth onwards. The accused has an imaginative
belief that he is not sufficiently esteemed; he believes that he could
make himself invisible; he believes that he could build a great castle,
and furnish the rooms of this castle with innumerable plaits of hair.
Moreover, he is <b>hereditarily tainted with insanity</b>, and bodily examination
shows that he has <b>numerous stigmata of degeneration</b>. &sect; 51 of
the Criminal Code should apply to this case. Since the accused can
hardly be supposed to have the power of controlling his impulse, it
would appear necessary that he should be treated in a lunatic asylum.&mdash;Dr.
Leppmann, the other medical adviser, said: The case before us<span class="pagenum" id="Page619">[619]</span>
is one of extreme rarity. The accused suffers from severe congenital
taint, and exhibits a number of stigmata of degeneration. At the
time his offences were committed the accused was certainly emotionally
disturbed, and at the present time is still ill. Von Krafft-Ebing
reports only a few such cases, and the same is true of Dr.
Moll. The accused was incapable of free voluntary determination;
he is still unhealthy, and must be treated as a sick man.&mdash;<i>Counsel for
the Prosecution</i>: If the accused had been in possession of normal
mental health, it would have been necessary to punish him with
exceptional severity, for such offences as his profoundly endangered
public security; it would not be right for any gaps to exist in our
Criminal Code which made the punishment of such an offence impossible.
We may dispute in detail under which paragraph the
offence comes, but there can be no question but that it is a punishable
offence. The medical experts had, however, shown that the accused
was not fully sane, and he must be dealt with from this standpoint.</p>

<p>The President summed up as follows: The public sense of justice
naturally demands severe punishment for such an offence. The
accused, however, is not criminally responsible. In view of the
evidence given by the medical experts, the accused must be discharged,
on the understanding that his family will immediately
take steps to have him confined in an asylum. It was possible
that this decision would not satisfy every one, but in view of the
evidence before the court, no other course was possible.</p>

<p>This case appears to have had a suggestive influence, for
shortly afterwards a cashier, Alfred L., was arrested, who had cut
plaits of hair from the heads of two young girls. In his home
were found, in addition, seventeen plaits of hair, which he had
<b>bought</b>, among these the queue of a Chinese! Already when a
schoolboy L. had been affected with this morbid impulse.</p>

<p>There exist also homosexual or pseudo-homosexual hair
fetichists, especially among women, to whom the hair of another
woman&#8217;s head becomes a fetich. Remarkable is the following
passage in Gabriele d&#8217;Annunzio&#8217;s romance &#8220;Lust&#8221; (pp. 210-212;
Berlin, 1902):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you remember,&#8217; asked Donna Francesca (of her friend Donna
Maria), &#8216;at school, how we all wished to comb your hair? how we
used to fight about it every day? Imagine, Andreas, that blood
used actually to flow! Ah, I shall never forget the scenes between
Carlotta Fiordelise and Gabriella Vanni. It was maniacal! To comb
the hair of Maria Bandinelli was the one ardent desire of all the girls,
great and small alike. The infection spread through the whole school.
There followed prohibitions, warnings, severe punishment; we were
even threatened with having our own hair cut off. Do you remember,
Maria? All our heads were bewitched by the black snake which hung
from your head to your heels. What passionate tears every evening!
And when Gabriella Vanni, from jealousy, made that treacherous
cut with a pair of scissors! Gabriella had really lost her wits. Do
you remember?...&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page620">[620]</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Andreas remarked that none of his lady friends had had such a
growth of hair, so thick, so dark a forest, in which she could conceal
herself. The history of all these young girls, in love with a plait of
hair, filled with passion and jealousy, who burned to lay comb and
hands upon this living treasure, seemed to him a most stimulating and
poetic episode of cloistral life.&#8221;</p>

<p>There exists also a negative hair fetichism. Hirschfeld reports
the case of a prostitute who was a well-developed fetichist for
baldness. Among many races, removal of the hair is a means of
sexual stimulation.</p>

<p>Nose, lips, mouth (<i>cf.</i> Belot&#8217;s novel, &#8220;La Bouche de Madame
X.&#8221;), and ears, can all become the objects of sexual fetichism,
though in most cases only of the lesser fetichism; the eyes also,
which as fetichistic charms play an important part, and are
effective especially through their colour. It is uncertain if, in
this relationship, clear blue eyes or sparkling black eyes have the
greater importance. The female breast is a natural physiological
fetich for the male sex. But over and above this there exists a
remarkable variety of breast fetichists, who employ the isolated
breast, separated from the body, for the binding of books.
According to Witkowski (&#8220;Tetoniana,&#8221; p. 35; Paris, 1898),
certain bibliomaniacs and erotomaniacs have books bound with
women&#8217;s skin taken from the region of the breast, so that the
nipple forms a characteristic swelling on the cover! A further
account of these human skin fetichists is given by Dr. Picard in
the <i>Gazette M&eacute;dicale de Paris</i>, July 19, 1906.</p>

<p>Von Krafft-Ebing contests the existence of a special &#8220;<b>genital
fetichism</b>&#8221;; but the universal diffusion of the phallus-cult contradicts
his opinion; the phallus-cult is unquestionably connected
with fetichistic ideas, which are embodied in the symbols
of the lingam and the yoni. According to
<span class="nowrap">Weininger,<a id="FNanchor629"></a><a href="#Footnote629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></span> woman,
speaking generally, is <b>only</b> a phallus fetichist; man exists for her
only as a sexual organ.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;I think people have been unwilling to see&mdash;or they have been
unwilling to say; they have hardly formed accurate idea for themselves&mdash;what
the copulatory organ of a man is for a woman, as wife,
even as virgin; what it psychologically signifies; how it dominates to
the uttermost the entire life of woman, although she herself may be
completely unconscious of the fact. I do not mean at all that
woman regards the male penis as beautiful, or even pretty. She
regards it as man regards the Gorgon&#8217;s head, as the bird regards
the snake&mdash;it exercises upon her a hypnotizing, magical, fascinating
influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goethe lays stress on the beauty which the male penis has
in woman&#8217;s eyes, when, in the paralipomena to the first part
of &#8220;Faust&#8221; (Weimar edition, vol. xiv., p. 307), he makes Satan
say in his address to women:</p>

<p>Georg Hirth also (&#8220;Ways to Love,&#8221; pp. 566, 567) speaks of
an instinctive belief on the part of woman in the &#8220;beauty and
the paradisaical force of the phallus,&#8221; and he regrets &#8220;the unnatural
depreciation and mendacious concealment of this portion
of the male body&#8221; by the conventional morality discovered by
the world of men.</p>

<p>The wide diffusion of the genital fetichistic tendencies in man
and woman is clearly manifested by the extremely frequent
occurrence of isolated adoration of the genital organs in the
practices of cunnilinctus and fellatio, which in numerous individuals
completely replace normal coitus.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Very rare is a case, which came under my own observation, of
isolated penis-foreskin fetichism in a heterosexual man. He is thirty
years of age, and a student of natural science, in whom at the age of
four years the first manifestation of sexual excitement occurred;
later, towards the age of puberty, sexual excitement became always
associated with the mental representation of a male penis, and more
especially of the foreskin of that organ, whilst he felt antipathy to
the idea of actual sexual intercourse with men, and felt attracted to
women. Still, from time to time the imaginative representation of
the membrum virile takes possession of his mind as a sort of coercive
idea, and when this happens the patient masturbates, at the same
time often making sketches of a penis.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A singular case of exclusively genital fetichism is reported by
P. Garnier (&#8220;Les Fetichistes,&#8221; pp. 170-174; Paris, 1896).</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>This case was that of a man, forty-eight years of age, who in normal
sexual intercourse was almost completely impotent, and who could
obtain sexual gratification only by the <b>observation of the genital
organs of human beings and animals</b>, and who, as in the case just
mentioned, was sexually excited by making sketches of genital organs.
This person exhibited obvious symptoms of nervous disorder.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>We might regard it as hardly possible that cases should exist
in which the fetichism related to genital organs of a dubious
character&mdash;&#8220;hermaphrodite fetichism&#8221;; and yet a veritable
case of such hermaphrodite fetichism has come under my own
observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page622">[622]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The case is that of an officer, who is always searching for hermaphroditic
formations of the genital organs. He is pretty well known
in this respect among the prostitutes of Berlin, who make use of his
inclination for their own advantage, by a demonstration to him of
reputed hermaphrodites. He has had the good fortune to discover
several real hermaphrodites; but notwithstanding all his endeavours,
his affection has never been returned.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The hand, especially a woman&#8217;s hand, is not simply an object
for cheiromancy, but is also the occasion of a sexual fetichism by
which the hand is spiritualized. The beautiful, finely-formed
hand is a powerful love-charm. Binet reports the case of a young
man in whom sexual excitement was exclusively produced by
a woman&#8217;s hand, and he was always on the look-out for opportunities
of touching the beautiful hands of women. Isolated
foot fetichism is rarer; it is generally associated with the very
common shoe fetichism (<i>vide <a href="#Ref4">infra</a></i>). The buttocks, the kallipygian
charms of women, have always been a sexual fetich for
men. Among flagellants this may become isolated as a fetich, and
completely divorced from the personality as a whole. For such
individuals, in sexual relationships, only the posteriora exist.</p>

<p>Among the bodily functions which are capable of acting as
fetiches, the <b>smell</b>, the emanation of the body, unquestionably
takes the first place. Smell fetichism is a very frequent phenomenon.
Regarding the intimate relationships between the sense
of smell and the <i>vita sexualis</i>, and regarding the existence of
certain specific sexual odours, I have already recorded the most
important facts in the first chapter of the present work (<a href="#Page15">pp. 15</a>-<a href="#Page18">18</a>).
As sexual odours, the emanation from the hair of the head,
the emanation from the armpits, the smell of the genital region,
and the general emanation from the skin, come under
<span class="nowrap">consideration.<a id="FNanchor630"></a><a href="#Footnote630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></span></p>

<p>The fetichism for red hair is frequently no more than an
apparent hair fetichism; much more often it is really a smell
fetichism, because since early times red-haired individuals have
been supposed to emit an emanation having a powerful sexually
exciting influence. In the Romance countries, France and
Italy, this belief is universally diffused. I quote another passage
from d&#8217; Annunzio&#8217;s &#8220;Lust&#8221; (p. 66):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page623">[623]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you noticed the armpits of Madame Chlysoloras?&#8217; The
Duke of Beffi indicated the dancer, upon whose alabaster forehead a
firebrand of red hair was shining, like that which we see in the
priestesses of Alma Tadema. Her bodice was fastened on the shoulders
by very narrow straps, and in the armpits one could see two luxuriant
tufts of red hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bomminaco begins to speak at large regarding the peculiar odour
which is diffused by red-haired women.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Binet tells of a student of medicine who one day, when sitting
on a bench reading, suddenly had an erection of the penis, and
on looking round he saw sitting on the same bench a red-haired
woman, whom he had not before consciously observed, from
whom a powerful odour emanated.</p>

<p>The <b>odour of the armpits</b> also appears in France to find
fetichistic lovers. The French cocotte commonly assumes
during coitus a position in which the man has his nose in one of
her armpits, and sometimes spontaneously offers this position.
At the unrestrained dances in the Parisian winter season, more
especially at the very free <i>bal des quat&#8217;z arts</i>, held in the spring,
we frequently see the men sniffing at the armpits of the girls.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable that the odour of the body at large may
in certain circumstances act as a sexual fetich. Many peculiar
love relationships prove this fact. From very early times
among the common people the odour of sweat has been regarded
as a powerful aphrodisiac. I may allude to the case, reported
by von Krafft-Ebing, of King Henry III., who dried his face
with the chemise of Maria of Cleves, dripping with sweat, and
thereby was inspired with a passionate love for her. I may
refer also to the case of a peasant who, when dancing, was
accustomed to dry the face of his partner with his handkerchief,
which he had carried in his own armpit, and thus
produced in her voluptuous excitement. An Indian king,
when choosing his beloved, did so simply by smelling the
clothing moistened by their perspiration, and selected the
woman whose clothing was most agreeable to his sense of
<span class="nowrap">smell.<a id="FNanchor631"></a><a href="#Footnote631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></span>
Oscar A. H. Schmitz informed me that an English
traveller in India related to him that in India lovers
sometimes changed underclothing. Each wears the shirt impregnated
with the perspiration of the other. The love of
Princess Chimay for the gipsy Rig&oacute; is stated to have been a
typical &#8220;smell-love&#8221; of this kind. It is said that the odour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page624">[624]</span>
negresses and mulattresses has an especially powerful exciting
influence upon Frenchmen, of which the poet Baudelaire is
mentioned as an example; this writer declared that smell was the
third and highest degree of voluptuousness. Recently Peter
Altenberg, in &#8220;Prodromos,&#8221; has described the sexual importance
of the odour of the body at large. Such typical smell fetichists,
luxuriating in the general emanation of the feminine body, are
mentioned by Mac&eacute;, the chief of the Parisian police. He describes
very vividly how, in the larger shops, such men move about
among the feminine customers, in order to intoxicate themselves
with the odours proceeding from them.</p>

<p>In opposition to these general bodily odours, the specific
genital odours play in the human species a subordinate part;
they are for the most part perceived as unpleasant.
<span class="nowrap">Falck<a id="FNanchor632"></a><a href="#Footnote632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></span> is
of opinion that this antipathy only becomes apparent after
sexual intercourse, whilst before such intercourse the odour of
the genital organs has a slight erotic stimulating influence.
Many cases of cunnilinctus and fellatio are certainly referable
to olfactory impressions. The following case is plainly indicative
of the sexual influence of genital odours:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>An Italian woman loved, after sexual intercourse, to retain on her
hands the odour of the genital secretions, and on such occasions,
although usually a scrupulously clean person, she avoided washing
her hands. She was especially fond of mingling this odour with that
of cigarette smoke. She was entirely free from stigmata of degeneration;
on the contrary, she was an extremely robust, well-developed
person.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>One of the most remarkable and monstrous phenomena in the
domain of sexual perversities is that by which the <b>processes and
products of the ultimate stages of metabolism</b> become associated
with libido sexualis, become true sexual fetiches, and can more
especially give rise to a formal speciality of smell fetichism.
The position of the orifices of the alimentary canal and of the
urinary apparatus in the <b>immediate neighbourhood</b> of the genital
organs gives rise to a certain associative conjunction between
the functions of these parts, and this association is rendered
more intimate by various circumstances (<i>cf.</i> my &#8220;Contributions
to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221; vol. ii., pp. 224, 225).
In addition, the idealizing influence of libido sexualis plays a
part here; the identification of the desired individual with the
lover&#8217;s own ego leads the disagreeable and disgusting character
of those processes and parts to disappear, and ultimately brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page625">[625]</span>
about a comparison between the real &aelig;sthetic charm of the
beloved person and the coarsely material processes in question,
which takes the form of a sensually stimulating contrast. There
is not in this case any quite unusual association of ideas on the
part of a completely degenerate individual; we have rather to
do with a <b>general anthropological and ethnological phenomenon</b>.
I was myself the first to give an elaborate proof of this fact
(&#8220;Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221;
vol. ii., pp. 223-240); and I illuminated more especially the
remarkable r&ocirc;le of the so-called &#8220;<b>skatology</b>&#8221;&mdash;that is, the
sexual influence of the ultimate products of human metabolism,
and of the processes associated therewith&mdash;in <b>folk-lore</b>, in <b>mythology</b>,
in <b>superstition</b>, and in the <b>literature of all nations and
times</b>. In this way do we first arrive at an understanding of
the possibility of an erotic influence exercised by def&aelig;cation
and micturition, which is so often observed at the present day;
above all, in the so-called &#8220;<b>muse latrinale</b>&#8221;&mdash;in the widely
diffused practice of scribbling obscene inscriptions on the walls
of public <span class="nowrap">lavatories<a id="FNanchor633"></a><a href="#Footnote633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></span>&mdash;which
finds expression also in sexual
&#8220;<b>copralagnia and urolagnia</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Compare, in this connexion, S. Soukhanoff, &#8220;Contribution
&agrave; l&#8217;&Eacute;tude des Perversions Sexuelles,&#8221; published in <i>Annales
M&eacute;dico-Psycologiques</i>, January and February, 1901&mdash;a case of urolagnia
and copralagnia in a habitual masturbator, twenty-seven
years of age. A remarkable case of sexual excitement produced
by the odour of newly made hay, in a lawyer, twenty-five years
of age, is reported by Amrain (&#8220;Anthropophyteia,&#8221; vol. iv.,
p. 237). This person took off all his clothes, and rolled as if
intoxicated in the hay, until ejaculation occurred. He called
his impulse a &#8220;vis major.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is clear that masochistic and sadistic elements play an
important part in many cases of urolagnia and copralagnia. But
there are pure forms of smell fetichism in this category, as we
see in the case of those persons who become sexually excited in
consequence of the smell of the urine and f&aelig;ces of the beloved
person; or, speaking generally, by the smell of those excrements,
the person from whom they are derived being a matter of indifference.
These are the <i>renifleurs</i> and <i>&eacute;pongeurs</i> of the French
observers, who haunt public lavatories in order to obtain sexual
excitement from the smell of the excrements of persons of the
opposite sex. There even exist individuals who have the acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page626">[626]</span>
of def&aelig;cation and micturition performed by others on to their
own bodies; in this case the masochistic element is associated
with the element of smell fetichism.</p>

<p>A greater r&ocirc;le than that of the natural sexual odours is at the
present day played by <b>artificial perfumes</b>, which, as a fact, are
frequently employed as sexual fetiches. Their origin, and the
cause of their use, has been already explained (<a href="#Page17">p. 17</a>). From
early times prostitution and the demi-monde have made the
most extensive use of these artificial scents for the sexual allurement
of men. Men are, in general, more sensitive to sexual
stimulation by means of perfumes than women are. These
perfumes are partly derived from plants; in fact, the simple
odour of certain flowers produces sexual excitement&mdash;a fact well
known to many peasant <span class="nowrap">girls.<a id="FNanchor634"></a><a href="#Footnote634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></span>
Other sexually stimulating
scents are derived from the animal kingdom, such as musk, civet,
and ambergris. A French firm of perfumers advertises a perfume&mdash;&#8220;charme
secret&#8221;&mdash;the local employment of which is clearly
suggested in the advertisement. But in most cases only a portion
of the clothing or underclothing is perfumed. There exist
typical perfume fetichists, who can, as a rule, be sexually excited
only by means of some definite perfume, in the absence of which
they are impotent.</p>

<p>In comparison with smell, <b>taste</b> plays a very minor part.
Still, a primevally old popular custom, the use of &#8220;priapistic
flavouring agents,&#8221; rests upon fetichistic ideas of this kind.
Cunnilinctus and fellatio are perhaps also committed with the
desire to taste the genital organs; just as the same must be the
case with those not very rare practices in which flavouring agents
or beverages are brought into contact with the genital organs,
are impregnated, as it were, with their essence, and then
swallowed. To this belongs also the following original case:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A man obtains sexual gratification only in this way: by introducing
a cigar, small end first, into the female genital passage, leaving it
there a long time, and then smoking it, with the end thus impregnated
in his mouth.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>There exist many other forms of fetichism. It is impossible
to enumerate all these varieties. I shall, for example, refer only
to the not uncommon fetichism of women for athletes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page627">[627]</span>
acrobats, or for singers and actors; and to that of men for dancers,
and especially for horsewomen, whose appearance has quite a
fascinating influence on many men, more particularly when they
are actually on horseback.</p>

<p>Analogous to the previously described hermaphrodite fetichism
is fetichism for other bodily defects, as for obese, lame, and
hunchbacked persons.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Von Krafft-Ebing reported the case of a man who loved only girls
with a limp, which I can parallel by an observation of my own. A
merchant, thirty-two years of age (with slight stigmata of degeneration&mdash;Darwinian
pointed ears, slight asymmetry of the skull&mdash;but
in other respects with a very powerful build of body, and having
performed his year&#8217;s service in the cavalry), who since ten years of
age has been addicted to excessive masturbation, <b>is potent only in
intercourse with a girl who limps</b>. He cannot state when this perversion
first manifested itself in him. In any case, it has developed
into a typical fetichism.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>To this category belong, also, the abnormal love towards
<b>elderly</b> individuals, heterosexual &#8220;gerontophilia,&#8221; and the
fetichistic influence of certain peculiarities of character. Thus,
it is an old experience that a Don Juanesque, bold, and self-assertive
appearance on the part of men, and even depravity
and sexual lawlessness, exercise a fascinating influence upon
many women. This is, as it were, homologous to the previously
described influence of prostitutes and fast women upon men.</p>

<p>A peculiar fetich is constituted also by the human <b>voice</b>. A
sympathetic voice has often been the cause of a violent love
passion. Singers, both men and women, know something of
this powerful fetichistic charm of the voice.</p>

<p>Finally, sexual fetichism can extend to objects in relationship
with the beloved person, or with any human individual (&#8220;<b>object
fetichism</b>&#8221;), and this is very readily accounted for by the
<b>personification</b> and <b>spiritualization</b> of these objects of human
use, and especially of clothing, which appears to be a <b>part of
the personality</b> itself, and so quite naturally becomes a sexual
fetich. (See the detailed description given on p. 140 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p id="Ref4">Among the various forms of clothing fetichism, by far the
commonest is <b>shoe fetichism</b>, or &#8220;<b>retifism</b>.&#8221; After the Marquis
de Sade, who in his writings described the most important sexual
perversions, active algolagnia has been termed &#8220;sadism&#8221;; and
after Sacher-Masoch, passive algolagnia has been termed
&#8220;masochism.&#8221; I consider, therefore, that with the same and
even greater justification, as I have already suggested in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page628">[628]</span>
work on R&eacute;tif de la
<span class="nowrap">Bretonne,<a id="FNanchor635"></a><a href="#Footnote635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></span>
foot and shoe fetichism may be
denoted by the term &#8220;retifism,&#8221; for it is this sexual perversion
which manifests itself most markedly in R&eacute;tif&#8217;s life (1734-1806),
and in him, also, this perversion found its first literary interpreter
and apostle, in exactly the same manner as sadism was
made known in wider circles by de Sade and masochism by Sacher-Masoch.
R&eacute;tif first described typical foot fetichism and shoe
fetichism, and also wrote the first history of this subject. In
him this tendency appeared at the early age of ten years, as
he relates (vol. i., pp. 90-93) in his celebrated autobiography&mdash;a
work greatly admired by Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, and other
heroes of our classical literature. In this place, also, he gives a
very good explanation of the genesis of foot fetichism and shoe
fetichism:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;This fondness for beautiful feet, <b>which in me is so strong that it
unfailingly arouses my most powerful lust, and leads me to ignore any
ugliness in other respects</b>&mdash;does it arise from any physical or emotional
predisposition? In all those who have this peculiarity it is
very strong. Is it connected with any preference for an easy gait,
for a gracious, voluptuous, dancing movement? The peculiar
attraction which the foot-covering exercises is only the reflex of the
preference for beautiful feet, which stimulate even an animal. <b>Thus
a man comes to prize the covering almost as much as the thing itself.</b>
The passion which, since childhood, I have felt for such beautiful foot-coverings
was an acquired inclination, which, however, rested on a
natural preference. But the love for a small foot has a physical basis,
which finds expression in the Latin proverb, &#8216;Parvus pes, barathrum
grande.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>R&eacute;tif was a typical shoe fetichist. He trembled with desire
on viewing a woman&#8217;s shoe; he blushed when he saw it, as if it
were the girl herself. As a true fetichist, he <b>collected</b> the slippers
and shoes of his mistresses; he kissed them, and smelled them,
and sometimes masturbated into them. Especially fascinating
to him were the <b>high heels</b> of women&#8217;s shoes, a sight of which
sufficed to produce in him intense sexual excitement.</p>

<p>Shoe-fetichism existed in ancient times, and long ago it was
assumed that there was a relationship between the foot and the <i>vita
sexualis</i>. References to this matter will be found in my earlier
work, &#8220;Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221;
vol. ii., pp. 323-325. In modern shoe-fetichism masochistic ideas
(ideas of being trodden on, of placing the beloved&#8217;s foot on the
back of the neck) or sadistic ideas (ideas of treading upon the
beloved&#8217;s feet, etc.) played a part; also there were associated<span class="pagenum" id="Page629">[629]</span>
sensations of smell proceeding from the leather; the colour of
the shoes is likewise of importance. The &#8220;foot-wooers&#8221;&mdash;thus
are the shoe fetichists named in the speech of prostitutes&mdash;have
the most varied inclinations in respect of different shapes and
fashions of shoes. One loves ladies&#8217; boots, another riding-boots,
a third dancing-shoes, a fourth slippers, a fifth actually loves
coarse wooden peasants&#8217; shoes. Also, in respect of ornamentation,
colour, heels, etc., fancies vary. In one case known to me, a
clergyman was purely a heel fetichist. Hirschfeld records (&#8220;The
Nature of Love,&#8221; p. 148) the case of a man who was sexually
excited only by means of the ankle-wrinkles in boots; also the
case of a woman who was fascinated by the dusty boots of men,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a id="FNanchor636"></a><a href="#Footnote636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></span></p>

<p>Of other articles of clothing, the <b>corset</b>, <b>petticoat</b>, <b>chemise</b>,
<b>apron</b>, and, more especially, <b>stockings</b> and <b>handkerchiefs</b>, form
objects of sexual fetichism. F&eacute;licien Rops appears to have been
at once a corset fetichist and a stocking fetichist, for he frequently
draws feminine figures naked, except in respect of their
wearing corset and stockings. There are many men who are
able to complete intercourse with a woman only when she keeps
on her stockings or shoes. Others are excited only by the
articles of clothing; for instance, they represent in imagination
corset shops, in order, by looking at the corsets, to produce
orgasm and ejaculation; or they collect or
<span class="nowrap">steal<a id="FNanchor637"></a><a href="#Footnote637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></span> feminine underclothing,
especially handkerchiefs, in order to obtain sexual
excitement from smelling or looking at these, or to masturbate
with them. Finally, there exist fetichists for particular materials,
such as fur (loved especially by masochists), satin, silk, or even
entire costumes, such as a woman&#8217;s riding-dress, tights, mourning,
etc. D&#8217;Estoc describes, under the name &#8220;la course des araign&eacute;es&#8221;
(&#8220;the spider race&#8221;), the appearance of twenty women
in a brothel, who were clothed only in long black gloves reaching
to the shoulders and long black stockings. In the Berlin newspapers
there recently appeared an account of the fetichism of
a prince for long &#8220;gants de su&egrave;de&#8221; on slender women&#8217;s arms.
Unique in its kind would appear to be the case of the spectacle
fetichist, of which Hirschfeld gives an account (<i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 145, 146).</p>

for fetichism; unfortunately, no adjective can be formed from this term, so that
for practical purposes the foreign word is more applicable.</p>

Many women are sexually excited by the flowers of the garden chestnut-tree,
the smell of which resembles that of the semen of the male. A correspondent
has communicated to me several observations of this nature from the Taunus
district. G. d&#8217;Anunzio (&#8220;Lust,&#8221; p. 10) also describes the awakening of libido
sexualis in woman by the smelling of a bouquet of flowers.</p>

The Berlin newspapers, a few years ago, were full of accounts of such a thief,
who stole underclothing (<i>cf.</i> <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, No. 465, September 13, 1903).
He was the terror of all housewives in the western suburbs of Berlin. Ultimately
he was caught, and proved to be a workman, K. W. by name. In his
house the police found a varied assortment of underclothing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<p class="noindent">One of the most tragic, but unfortunately one of the most frequent,
of occurrences is <b>premature sexual intercourse on the
part of children</b>&mdash;partly resulting from <b>acts of fornication by
adults with children</b>, partly resulting from <b>premature awakening
of the sexual impulse in children, and premature sexual activity on
their part</b>. These two varieties of premature sexual intercourse in
children must be sharply distinguished each from the other.</p>

<p>The alleged increase of sexual offences in which children are
concerned is by von Krafft-Ebing wrongly associated with the
more widely diffused nervousness of recent generations. As a
matter of fact, such offences have occurred at all times and among
all peoples, with no less frequency than at the present day.
&#8220;Erotic p&aelig;dophilia&#8221; is a very widely diffused phenomenon. It
arises from <span class="nowrap">superstitious<a id="FNanchor638"></a><a href="#Footnote638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></span>
grounds; as, for example, from the
belief which prevails in many countries that venereal and other
diseases are cured by copulation with an intact child. The
primeval belief that intercourse with immature girls prolonged
life, that an emanation from them rejuvenated old men (the so-called
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>Shunammitism</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor639"></a><a href="#Footnote639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></span>),
led in former times, and leads even at
the present day, to acts of fornication with children. Less commonly
do timidity and impotence on the part of adult men, rendering
intercourse with adult women difficult or impossible, give rise
to the seduction or rape of defenceless and unsuspicious children.
The act of fornication with children as a <b>popular custom</b> is a symptom
of a primitive degree of civilization, and is therefore met with,
even at the present day, among savage nations, a matter regarding
which Ploss-Bartels gives detailed accounts.</p>

<p>Passing to consider the cause of acts of fornication with children
<b>at the present day</b>, and the means by which such acts are effected,
unquestionably <b>opportunity</b> plays an important part in their
production. All those persons who by their occupation are
brought into prolonged diurnal and nocturnal association with
children, and are frequently alone with them, such as menservants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page634">[634]</span>
nursemaids, governesses, housekeepers, schoolmasters
and schoolmistresses, the directors and other officials of orphan
asylums, etc., constitute a disproportionately large contingent of
those who commit offences under &sect; 176<sup>3</sup> and &sect; 182 of the Criminal
Code. This does not arise from exceptional criminality on the
part of these persons as compared with those belonging to other
professions, but simply and solely from the fact that they are
continually alone with children, and that any sexual excitement
which may arise is thus directed towards these, because no adult
is there. Sometimes a morbid neuropathic or psychopathic
constitution plays a part; but more commonly we have to
do simply with lasciviousness and sensuality, which avails itself
of the opportunity thus offered.</p>

<p>R&eacute;tif de la Bretonne warned parents regarding menservants
and nursemaids as seducers of children. These persons are apt
to execute unchaste acts with children <b>in the very first years of
life</b>; in order to gratify their own voluptuousness, they play with
the genital organs of these poor innocents, and thus prematurely
awaken sexual sensibility, and often give rise to premature onanistic
habits. These acts of impropriety carried on with small children&mdash;which
must be sharply distinguished from those with older
children, the cases being classified as relating in the first place
to children under six years of age, and in the second place to children
between the ages of six and fourteen years&mdash;are far commoner
than is usually imagined, and perhaps even more dangerous in
respect of the bodily and mental development of the child, than
the second variety of unchaste acts, with older children. In most
cases it is persons of the female sex who misuse small children in
this way, and often this arises from the fear of impregnation
resulting from intercourse with an adult man. Generally we
have to do with a lascivious disposition, as, for example, in the
following cases, which came under my own observation:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>In one of these cases a woman seduced a boy four years of age to
the performance of systematic improper acts; in the other case, a boy
of five years of age was taken (<i>horribile dictu</i>) by his own mother into
her bed, and taught to perform coitus with her, in so far as this was
possible, and also to perform manipulations with her genital organs.
The little boy repeated this practice with his sister, three years of age,
and, being caught in the act, he confessed the whole history.</p>

<p>A boy aged four played freely with his own genital organs, and also
made peculiar coitus-like movements in bed, and in contact with
his mother. When the latter, greatly alarmed, asked him how he had
learned to do this, he explained that a young woman twenty years of
age, living in the house, had performed these manipulations with him.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page635">[635]</span></p>

<p>Magnan also reports (&#8220;Lectures on Mental Disorders,&#8221; Nos.
2 and 3, p. 41) the case of a lady, twenty-nine years of age, who
performed sexual acts with her nephew, aged five.</p>

<p>These cases rarely attain publicity, because they usually remain
undiscovered. Fornicatory acts with children, such as are
frequently alluded to in the newspapers, chiefly concern children
between the ages of six and fourteen years. In these cases the
offences are most often committed by schoolmasters and schoolmistresses,
or by private tutors and governesses. We further
often find other women undertaking such acts, displaying a sexual
activity which they have no opportunity of satisfying in intercourse
with full-grown men. In the third place, debauchees and
exhausted <i>rou&eacute;s</i> seek new and piquant excitement by intercourse
with such <i>fruits verts</i>. Of such Laurent
<span class="nowrap">writes:<a id="FNanchor640"></a><a href="#Footnote640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;They have used and misused woman; they have explored all the
stages of natural and unnatural love; they have visited Lesbos and
Paphos; and they have experienced every possible sexual artificiality.
Their sexual desires have become torpid, their manliness is on the
decline, and sexual death approaches. But the more exhausted they
are, the less willing are they patiently to acquiesce in their loss. It
is with them as with inebriates who are full to the throat and still
continue to drink. One day they notice a little girl in the street and
feel stimulated by her youthful charms. Thus their love begins.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The <b>blameless</b>, the <b>natural</b>, and the <b>pure</b>, in the essence of the
child and of the intact virgin, has a stimulating influence upon such
perverted individuals: it acts as a <b>contrast</b> to their own sexual
shamelessness and artificiality. The contrast, in fact, has the
effect of a most powerful stimulus. Nor can we fail to recognize
the existence in such cases also of a <b>sadistic</b> element in the performance
of coitus with a defenceless child, and in the sanguinary
act of defloration of an immature individual. In the eighties
there flourished in England such a &#8220;<b>mania for defloration</b>,&#8221; the
scandalous details of which were illustrated in a lurid light by
the revelations of the <i>Pall Mall</i>
<span class="nowrap"><i>Gazette</i>.<a id="FNanchor641"></a><a href="#Footnote641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></span> With regard to this
sadistic element in acts of fornication with children, we must take
into account the possibility that in the corporal punishment of
children by the teacher may have originated the awakening of
the latter&#8217;s sexual <span class="nowrap">activities,<a id="FNanchor642"></a><a href="#Footnote642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></span>
and that in this we may find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page636">[636]</span>
cause of the beginning of sexual relationships between teacher
and pupil.</p>

<p>Other not infrequent causes of the sexual misuse of children are to
be found in <b>alcoholic intoxication</b> and in <b>senile dementia</b>. <b>Tramps</b>,
also, who have for a long time been deprived of the opportunity
of intercourse with women, are apt to gratify their long-repressed
libido on the body of the first child they meet. <b>Child labour in
factories</b> also offers opportunities for fornicatory acts with children.</p>

<p>A few especially striking instances of acts of fornication with
children are appended:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. The son of a greengrocer, A., twenty years of age, living in the
Keibelstrasse, had for a long time immoral intercourse with the eight-year-old
daughter of the milkman W., in the same street. He had not
only violated her, but had committed other injuries. The young
fellow continued his immoral conduct after he had become infected
with venereal disease, and therefore naturally infected the girl.
She became so ill that she had to be confined to bed, and the doctor
who was called in diagnosed venereal infection. Notwithstanding
this, the little girl continued to lie about the matter, and only after a
whipping did she admit having had intercourse with A. The latter,
a man with a crippled foot, as soon as he saw that his misconduct had
been discovered, concealed himself in an outhouse, and was only arrested
by the police after a prolonged search. He is now in prison.</p>

<p>2. The model and friend of a painter, during the absence of the latter
from home, seduced his son, twelve years of age, after preliminary
repeated masturbation, to coitus and cunnilinctus.</p>

<p>3. A celebrated actress, now in advanced age, in the case of a boy
who sought a situation in her house, gave rise by various manipulations
to an erection of the penis, and seduced him to coitus; she invited him
repeatedly to visit her, and continued this scandalous practice with
him for eight years.</p>

<p>4. The governess Friederike B. was accused of improper conduct
and seduction of the little boy Szepsan, and was condemned to six
months&#8217; rigorous imprisonment. In April, 1900, Szepsan disappeared
through her connivance; she had him confined under false names in
various cloisters. The accused denied all blame, and declared that
she was the benefactress of Szepsan, whom she intended to bring up
as a priest. The evidence, however, sufficed for her conviction.</p>

<p>5. A very scandalous affair is reported by <i>Le Matin</i>. Some time
ago the Parisian police arrested a young fellow on account of an
offence against certain civil and natural laws. The accused thereupon
denounced an old Count W., and others of his friends, and also Baron
A., who daily waited the coming out of the boys from certain Parisian
schools, and then took them in his automobile to his own house or
to that of Count W. The police, having received information, kept
under observation the sons of certain distinguished families attending
the school in question, and ascertained that the statements were true.
The Count and his friends carried off the boys, among whom were
three sons of an engineer, the eldest thirteen years of age, to the
Avenue MacMahon or the Avenue Friedland. A., who is engaged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page637">[637]</span>
a young lady belonging to the Parisian aristocracy, was arrested;
Count W. has escaped. The examination of their dwelling disclosed
all kinds of compromising materials.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In view of the wide diffusion of acts of fornication with children,
we must always keep one point clearly before our minds, on
account of the great forensic importance of the matter. That is
the question whether the initiative to the improper act proceeded
in the first place <b>from the child</b>, in consequence of a <b>premature
awakening of the sexual impulse</b>. [See, for example, Emil
Schultze-Malkowsky, &#8220;The Sexual Impulse in Childhood,&#8221; in
the periodical <i>Sex and Society</i>, 1907, No. 7, pp. 370-373. He
reports five sexual scenes dating from the year 1864, the heroine
of which was a little girl seven years of age!]</p>

<p>In a certain proportion only of such cases have we to do with
a degenerative, morbid, inherited state; in many instances this
sexual perversity occurs in children who in other respects are
perfectly <span class="nowrap">healthy,<a id="FNanchor643"></a><a href="#Footnote643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></span>
and is evoked by seduction, bad education,
and chance causes, such as intestinal worms, etc. This is to be
observed also in children of savage races, among whom this
phenomenon of sexual prematurity is perhaps more frequent, in
part owing to climatic conditions. In the country the observation
of sexual acts on the part of animals, frequently occurring
under their very eyes, makes children early acquainted with the
fact of sexual intercourse. In large towns prostitution and overcrowded
dwellings, in ways to which we have already alluded in
detail, give rise in many cases to a very early initiation of children
into a knowledge of the facts of sexual life.</p>

<p>Apart from the question of child prostitution, to which we shall
allude presently, we can observe such early mature types of children
also in every class of the population of large towns. Among
the circles of the middle classes, and among the &#8220;upper ten
thousand,&#8221; we have the type of the <i>demi-vierge</i>, which recently
Hans von Kahlenberg has so admirably described in his &#8220;Nixchen.&#8221;
In the female sex this early sexual maturity is much more
clearly manifest. In an essay entitled &#8220;The Zoo as an Educator,&#8221;
in the weekly newspaper <i>Der Roland von Berlin</i> (No. 27, July 5,
1906), we find a striking description of such a type:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;We find definite types of early-ripe girls, which we must regard as a
peculiar acquirement of the twentieth century. We distinguish without
difficulty the simple, hot-blooded, sensual variety from the thoroughly
developed perverse types. A short-legged, buxom type is the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page638">[638]</span>
predominant. Such girls seem extraordinarily energetic, and appear
also to excel in mental powers their pale-cheeked and half-alive male
companions. Their dress is extremely conspicuous, and they wear
highly ornamented hats. Whilst, when we look at them from behind,
their whole figure suggests the age of fifteen or seventeen years, the front
view suggests that they are at least eight years older. They prefer
to lace very tightly, in order to display their rounded hips, and to make
their already strongly developed breasts all the more imposing. But
this development displays their mental and physical corruption,
especially when undeveloped shoulders and thin arms show beyond
question that they are really of a very tender age. The sharply-cut
features, with the sparkling black eyes, which at once fascinate us,
plainly indicate the lines which the passions are about to engrave on
their features; we discern, also, that by the age of thirty they will
already be old women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sexual intercourse on the part of children with one another, or
with grown persons in cases in which the invitation has proceeded
from the child, are by no means rare occurrences. The following
remarkable cases may illustrate this:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. Some years ago a schoolboy, K. J., thirteen years of age, was
accused in Berlin of several acts of sexual intercourse with girls of
from six to eight years. The guilt of the accused was fully proved.
He was sent to a reformatory.</p>

<p>2. A young man made the acquaintance of a girl sixteen years of
age. Although greatly impassioned, he did not dare to touch the girl,
because he was deceived by her sweet and blameless demeanour, and
did not wish to be her first seducer. Soon afterwards he learned that
this angel had had sexual intercourse for several years with a married
man forty years of age!</p>

<p>3. Legroux showed in 1890, at the weekly meeting of the physicians
of the Hospital St. Louis, a boy, eleven years of age, who, after three
months&#8217; sexual intercourse with a syphilitic girl aged seven years,
had been infected in the ordinary manner, <i>per vias naturales</i> (reference
in <i>Unna&#8217;s Monatsheft f&uuml;r Dermatologie</i>, 1890, vol. x., p. 335).</p>

<p>4. In Paris, in December, 1906 (according to the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> of
December 15, 1906, No. 558), a band of youthful street and shop
thieves, ten in number, of ages varying from eleven to fourteen years,
were arrested. Their leaders were a boy of twelve and a girl of thirteen
years, the latter, Eliza Cailles by name, known generally by the
nickname of &#8220;Beautiful Aliette.&#8221; This Aliette, a strikingly pretty
little person, in a long dress of extremely fashionable cut, with a
wonderful hat and most elegant gloves, ruled her band with the most
exemplary self-confidence. They were all smart fellows; <b>they were
all of them her lovers, and with these ten husbands she was the happiest
of wives</b>.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Acts of fornication with children also explain the melancholy
phenomenon of the existence of a widely diffused <b>child prostitution</b>
in all large towns of the old and new world, regarding which,
in the previously mentioned works on prostitution in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page639">[639]</span>
towns, detailed accounts will be
<span class="nowrap">found.<a id="FNanchor644"></a><a href="#Footnote644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></span> The little flower-girls
of Paris, the Berlin match-sellers and wax-candle-sellers or
&#8220;music pupils&#8221;&mdash;all these provide a large contingent to child
prostitution. To a great extent they are associated with equally
youthful criminals and <i>souteneurs</i>, and avail themselves for blackmailing
purposes of the existence of &sect; 176<sup>3</sup> and &sect; 186 of the
Criminal Code. Among them there are even individuals given
to peculiar sexual &#8220;specialities,&#8221; who gratify perverse lusts in
various artificial ways. Social misery, bad example, and seduction
are, indeed, often to be blamed as causes of this early sexual
depravity, but it is precisely in respect of child prostitution that
Lombroso&#8217;s doctrine of the born prostitute has considerable
justification.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">In exceptional cases only does <b>incest</b>&mdash;sexual intercourse between
those nearly related by blood, either in the same generation,
as between brother and sister, or in the ascending and descending
line&mdash;depend upon pathological causes. The origin of the dread
and horror inspired by incest remains &#8220;a moot question of historical
<span class="nowrap">research.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor645"></a><a href="#Footnote645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></span>
Within historical times and among savage peoples
incestuous intercourse was permitted and widely diffused.
Without doubt, racial hygienic experience regarding the pernicious
effects of this extreme form of incest gave rise to the recognition
of the fact that incest must be forbidden. At the present day
incest occurs almost exclusively as the result of chance associations&mdash;as,
for example, in alcoholic intoxication, in consequence of
close domestic intimacy in small dwellings, in the absence of other
opportunity for sexual intercourse. In such circumstances not
infrequently among the lower classes of the population we observe,
as a favouring factor, a complete absence of any conception
of the immorality of incest.</p>

<p>Remarkable is the tendency to incestuous unions in certain
epochs&mdash;as, for example, in the period of the French Rococo,
when it was introduced by suggestion on a large scale, and
manifested itself with alarming frequency. Numerous credible
historical examples of this I have recorded in my &#8220;Recent
Researches concerning the Marquis de Sade&#8221; (pp. 165-168).
Mirabeau, and especially R&eacute;tif de la Bretonne (see my work on
R&eacute;tif, pp. 381-382), luxuriated in horribly blasphemous incestuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page640">[640]</span>
<span class="nowrap">ideas.<a id="FNanchor646"></a><a href="#Footnote646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></span>
According to Theodor Mundt, who speaks of these
tendencies in his sketches of &#8220;Paris during the Second Empire&#8221;
(vol. i., pp. 141, 142; Berlin, 1867), it appears that the French
nature is not repelled to the same degree as the German by the
idea of sexual union between those nearly related by blood.
Eugene Sue relates, in his &#8220;Mysteries of Paris,&#8221; that among the
lowest strata of the population fathers often have intercourse
with their own daughters.</p>

<p>But such things also happen in Germany. In August, 1907, a
manual labourer, forty-seven years of age, was condemned to three
years&#8217; imprisonment because he had had incestuous intercourse with
his daughter, now twenty-seven years of age, during the previous
fifteen years (!), and had continued this incestuous relationship
after he had himself remarried. The girl had been for several
years living in intimate sexual relationship with her father, who
watched jealously to prevent his daughter having anything to
do with another man. Among many Indian tribes of Central
America incest is said to be always practised when the eldest
daughter accompanies the father for a few days into the mountains,
in order to prepare his maize bread for him.</p>

<p>Relations somewhat analogous are those in which parent and
child have sexual intercourse with the same person&mdash;when, for
example, mother and daughter have the same lover. Other
peculiar combinations are possible, and are actually observed.
Unique, however, would appear to be the case reported by d&#8217;Estoc
(&#8220;Paris-Eros,&#8221; p. 209), in which a young man had sexual intercourse
with a woman, with her two daughters, and also utilized
the father of this family as a passive p&aelig;derast! In a manuscript
novel, which I once saw, a man was made the lover of both husband
and wife.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of sexual aberrations, in the reality
of which, as <span class="nowrap">Mirabeau<a id="FNanchor647"></a><a href="#Footnote647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></span>
remarked, it is hardly possible to believe,
is <b>fornication with animals&mdash;zoophilia and</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>bestiality</b>.<a id="FNanchor648"></a><a href="#Footnote648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page641">[641]</span></p>

<p>We will first describe zoophilia, a sexual inclination towards
animals without actual sexual intercourse. Genuine zoophilia, or
&#8220;<b>animal fetichism</b>,&#8221; as a perversion <b>monopolizing</b> the human
being&#8217;s circle of sexual ideas, is very rare. Until recently, only a
single case has been published&mdash;that recorded by Dr. Hanc in
1887, in the <i>Wiener Medizinische Bl&acirc;tter</i>, and quoted also by
von Krafft-Ebing. But I myself, in the year 1905, observed a
second case of genuine zoophilia, and have recorded it
<span class="nowrap">elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor649"></a><a href="#Footnote649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></span>
This extraordinarily rare case may as well be once
more detailed here:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The person concerned was a farmer, forty-two years of age, of a large
and imposing appearance, a healthy aspect, and normal conformation.
His family history did not show any points of importance throwing
light on the peculiar development of his <i>vita sexualis</i>. In the family
several unhappy marriages had occurred. The patient&#8217;s parents had
also lived in such an inharmonious marriage. His mother had a masterful
manner; he felt no love for her. He knew nothing of any sexual
abnormalities in his family. He lays especial stress upon the fact that
when an infant he was brought up on the bottle, and that in this
way he missed the first unconscious natural sexual stimulations
which, according to the theory propounded by S. Freud, proceed
from the suckling at the maternal breast. To this he mainly
ascribes his lack of sexual sensibility towards the female sex. When
he was a boy twelve years of age, the patient experienced sexual
excitement for the first time when riding on a fine horse. Since that
time his sexual sensibility as a whole has been closely connected with
the idea of fine horses, in this way, that merely to look at them
produced libidinous excitement, so that for years, once a week, while
riding, he had an ejaculation, accompanied by intense voluptuous
sensations. It is, however, remarkable that he never had any erotic
dreams connected with horses. As already stated, his sexual sensibility
regarding the human female, and also the human male, is non-existent.
His views regarding women are Schopenhauerian. The
few attempts he had made at intimate intercourse with women&mdash;in
most cases these were <i>puell&aelig; public&aelig;</i>&mdash;were
repulsive to him; he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page642">[642]</span>
on these occasions no erection at all, or only a very slight one. The
<i>vita sexualis</i> of the patient is, speaking generally, by no means an
active one. He does not experience nocturnal pollutions, and is completely
satisfied sexually by the weekly ejaculations and libidinous
excitement which occurs when riding on horseback. For several years
the patient has suffered from frequent insomnia, the cause of which
he considered to be material troubles combined with gloomy thoughts
about his abnormal sexual condition. Bromides, veronal, and other
hypnotic drugs, are of little use to him, for habituation soon sets in; on
the other hand, cold foot-baths have a better effect. The patient, who,
as he himself says, has a strong antipathy to normal sexual intercourse,
which he regards as a &#8220;bestial act,&#8221; believes that he might perhaps
attain a normal sexual condition if he could meet with a wife who
would be sympathetic, and would be in harmony with him mentally and
physically. He is, however, in this respect extremely sceptical, since
he is well aware of the rarity of that complete harmony which is the
indispensable prerequisite of a happy marriage. The patient exhibited
no symptoms whatever of &#8220;degeneration.&#8221; The genital organs were
normal, and nervous sleeplessness in a man forty-two years of age,
dependent upon material cares and emotional depression, cannot be
regarded as a symptom of degeneration, when we reflect how frequently
in persons who are otherwise quite healthy such nervous insomnia
may make its appearance, as a result of the struggle for life, at or near
the age of forty years.</p>

<p>True zoophilia is a typical sexual perversion, and appears to
occur principally in men. The use of animals (dogs) for purely
onanistic purposes, in the way of licking the female genital organs,
cannot be included in this connexion. In French novels and
moral studies of recent times such types of zoophilous women are,
indeed, described; thus, for example, in Octave Mirbeau&#8217;s
&#8220;Badereise eines Neurasthenikers&#8221; (1902) we find a description
of Princess Karagnine as such a perverse woman, endowed with
a peculiar &#8220;passion for animals,&#8221; especially for stallions, who
caresses them with obvious signs of sexual excitement. And in
the de Goncourts&#8217; &#8220;Diary&#8221; I find the following remark:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Every time I visit the Zoological Gardens, I am struck by the
number of bizarre, remarkably eccentric, exotic, indefinable women
we meet here, to whom the contact with the animal world of this
place appears to constitute an adventure of physical love&#8221; (Edmond
and Jules de Goncourt, &#8220;Leaves from a Diary,&#8221; 1851 to 1895).</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>R. Schwaebl&eacute; also gives an interesting account of the zoophilous
tendencies of Frenchwomen (&#8220;Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es de Paris,&#8221; pp. 203-212).</p>

<p>Unquestionably, modern zoological gardens offer even more
than country life opportunities to women of zoophilous instincts,
and can in this respect become dangerous. I remember from my
own schooldays in Hanover remarkable scenes in the much-visited<span class="pagenum" id="Page643">[643]</span>
zoological gardens of that town&mdash;scenes which at that time
we naturally did not really understand, but on which the above
remarks and observations throw a clear light.</p>

<p>Thus we shall no longer be surprised by the following extremely
remarkable case of zoophilia in the female sex:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p><i>Kleptomania in a Girl aged Thirteen.</i>&mdash;A girl thirteen years of age, who
is incurably affected with kleptomania, and who at the same time
has a morbid inclination towards horses, is the most recent phenomenon
in the province of decadence. The unfortunate child is the daughter,
Frida, of a married couple living in the H&ouml;chstestrasse. She had committed
a number of thefts of vehicles, which might have been attributed
only to skilled professional thieves. The morbid tendency compels
the child to take the horse by the bridle and lead it away. She does
not appear to have any tendency to sell the animal, or to steal anything
from the carriage. Her love for horses led her in earlier years
to unusual acts. Thus she took the horse of a dairyman in the Elbingerstrasse
out of its stall, mounted it, and rode away. The child has
been under medical treatment for a long time on account of her extremely
unusual tendency, and we understand that the medical evidence
shows that she cannot be held legally responsible for the offences
she has committed (<i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, No. 352, July 14, 1906).</p>

<p>Passing now to consider definite acts of fornication with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page644">[644]</span>animals (<i>Sodomie</i>&mdash;see
note <a href="#Footnote648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> to <a href="#Page640">p. 640</a>,
<span class="nowrap">bestiality),<a id="FNanchor650"></a><a href="#Footnote650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></span> there is hardly
any animal which has not been in some way and at some time
utilized for the gratification of human lust; but naturally in
most cases the animals always available were employed, such as
dogs, cats, sheep, goats, hens, geese, ducks, horses. Martin
Schurig, as early as 1730, in his &#8220;Gyn&aelig;cologia&#8221; (pp. 380-387),
recorded a large number of cases of bestial aberrations in which,
in addition to the animals above mentioned, apes, bears, and
even fishes were employed. In antiquity snakes were often the
objects of unnatural lust on the part of women, playing the part
of the modern lap-dog. Bestiality is very widely
<span class="nowrap">diffused.<a id="FNanchor651"></a><a href="#Footnote651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></span>
Countries especially celebrated for the frequency of this practice
are China and Italy; in the former country <b>geese</b>, in the latter
<b>goats</b>, are preferred for sexual malpractices. In India, and also
among the Southern Slavs, horses and donkeys play the principal
part as objects of bestial <span class="nowrap">love.<a id="FNanchor652"></a><a href="#Footnote652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></span></p>

<p>Acts of fornication with animals are due to various causes; in
exceptional cases only can they be referred to morbid predisposition.
In the lower classes of the population, and among many
races&mdash;as, for example, among the Southern Slavs and among
the Persians&mdash;the superstitious belief that venereal disease can
be cured by intercourse with animals occasionally gives rise to
bestiality. More frequently the <b>lack of opportunity for normal
gratification</b> of the sexual impulse is the cause of bestiality; and
it is naturally of more frequent occurrence in the country, for the
reason that there human beings live in closer association with
animals than they do in the town. The herdsman alone with his
herd in a solitary place, the groom who in the stable suddenly
finds himself in a state of sexual excitement, the peasant whose
wife is perhaps ailing&mdash;all these indulge in bestiality simply from
opportunity. Friedrich S. Krauss learned from a trustworthy
authority that in the Austrian cavalry Slavonic soldiers frequently
gratified their sexual impulse upon mares. When they
are caught doing this, they excuse themselves by saying that they
are too poor to pay a woman. Commonly these fellows escape
punishment. In brothels, also, bestial practices are common;
in some cases debauchees themselves take part in these practices,
in others prostitutes make a display of bestial intercourse. Frequently,
also, sadistic impulses, similar to those which find
expression in the torturing or slaughtering of animals during
coitus, play a part in bestial intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page645">[645]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>An eyewitness describes such a brothel scene, which took place in the
Via San Pietro all&#8217; Orto at Milan. An old rou&eacute; played the principal
part in this; he had become so depraved that he had sexual intercourse
with a duck, the throat of which was cut during the bestial act!</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Some forty years ago, in the Karntnerstrasse in Vienna, a
prostitute was found in her room, murdered, and her chambermate
and professional companion was condemned to imprisonment
as guilty of the murder. After some years, however, the
real murderer was discovered, and he was detected by the fact
that he was only able to have an erection of the penis when he
killed a <b>hen</b>. He was known among the prostitutes as &#8220;the
hen-man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another case of sadistic bestiality was recently reported by the
veterinary surgeon Grundmann, at Marienburg in Saxony (the
reference will be found in the <i>Berliner Tier&auml;rztliche Wochenschrift</i>
for September 14, 1906):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A man, thirty-eight years of age, of bad reputation, one night found
his way into a byre in order to gratify his sexual desires by intercourse
with a cow. First he introduced his penis into the vagina of a heifer
nine months old; then he tried the same thing on a cow, which threw
him off, and he fell to the ground. In a rage at this, he seized a pitchfork
and forcibly thrust one of the prongs, first into the anus of the
heifer, and then into that of the cow. The cow died speedily, whilst
the heifer had to be slaughtered next day. In the cow, in addition
to a laceration of the rectum about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches in length, there
was found laceration of the capsules of the right and left kidneys,
perforation of the mesentery, of the colon, of the liver, and of
the diaphragm, also a laceration 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long and equally
deep in the right lung. These extensive injuries showed that the
pitchfork must have been thrust in repeatedly. The appearances in
the body of the slaughtered heifer were similar to those found in the
cow. The accused was condemned to imprisonment for two years
and three months, part of this term being for the offence against
morality and part for the injury to property.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The following extremely rare case of bestiality on the part of
a woman was seen by Krauss (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 281):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;If I can venture to credit the reports I have so frequently heard
(and it is difficult to believe that they are pure inventions), among the
Southern Slavs intercourse between women and horses or asses is
comparatively common. How they go to work in this matter I do
not know from personal observation. I did, however, once see a
Chrowot woman of ideal beauty, who <b>stood</b> at night completely naked
in front of a lighted lamp, and in this position had intercourse with a
tom cat. She experienced so intense an orgasm that she did not
notice me, although I watched the scene barely two paces from the
window.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page646">[646]</span></p>

<p>The part played by lap-dogs in the case of many ladies has been
previously mentioned.</p>

<p>Formerly the question was quite seriously discussed, whether
a human being could be seduced or violated by an animal, and
Hufeland relates a fantastic story of copulation between a dog
and a sleeping little girl, which I have criticized in another
<span class="nowrap">work;<a id="FNanchor653"></a><a href="#Footnote653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></span>
but there are, as a matter of fact, no proofs of such
an occurrence, or of its possibility. In brothels, certainly,
dogs are from time to time <i>trained</i> to have intercourse with
<span class="nowrap">prostitutes.<a id="FNanchor654"></a><a href="#Footnote654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></span></p>

<p>Much rarer than acts of fornication with animals are similar
acts with <b>corpses</b>, the so-called &#8220;<b>necrophilia</b>.&#8221; In the works
of de Sade, we find references to the algolagnistic factor
of this rare sexual aberration, to the sadistic or masochistic
element in necrophilia, inasmuch as in the case of the dead
individual we have to do with a completely helpless and defenceless
being, who is totally unable to resist the act; sadism is also
manifested in the not uncommon mutilation of the
<span class="nowrap">corpses;<a id="FNanchor655"></a><a href="#Footnote655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></span> and
the sadistic impulse further obtains gratification from the idea of
decomposition, from the smell, the cold, and the horror. In the
case of necrophilia opportunity also plays a part. Soldiers and
monks who are occupied in watching the dead, and who chance
to be seized with sexual excitement, have gratified themselves with
female corpses.</p>

<p>Sexual acts with corpses are, indeed, not so rare as was formerly
assumed, but they belong to the class of sexual aberrations regarding
which we have but few authentic observations, most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page647">[647]</span>
these derived from French authors. Remarkable is the following
recent case, which occurred in April,
<span class="nowrap">1901:<a id="FNanchor656"></a><a href="#Footnote656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The following hardly credible case of necrophilia is reported from
Schonau: In the cemetery of that place Frau Maschke, thirty years
of age, was buried in the morning, but the grave was not completely
filled in. In the evening an inhabitant visited the grave of a
relative, which was close to that of Frau Maschke, and she noticed
with alarm that the top of the coffin in which the corpse of Frau
Maschke was lying was moving up and down. The discoverer of this
alarming occurrence hastened to the sexton, and reported the fact.
The sexton hurried to the cemetery with several workmen, and there,
to their horror, they surprised an inmate of the poorhouse named
Wokatsch as he was in the act of violating the woman&#8217;s corpse. The
bestial criminal was at once arrested. Soon afterwards a judicial
investigation took place, for which purpose the corpse was removed
from the grave and taken to the mortuary in order to determine how
far the criminal had actually proceeded in his attempt on the body.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In folk-lore, mythology, and belles-lettres, necrophilia plays a
large part, a matter to which I have referred at greater length
in another work (&#8220;Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia
Sexualis,&#8221; vol. ii., pp. 288-296). The <b>idea</b> of intercourse with a
dead body, and also that of intercourse with an insensible human
being, somewhat frequently gives rise to peculiar forms of sexual
aberration. First of all in this connexion we have to consider
<b>symbolic necrophilia</b>, in which the person concerned contents
himself with the simple appearance of death. A prostitute or
some other woman must clothe herself in a shroud, lie in a coffin,
or on the &#8220;bed of death,&#8221; or in a room draped as a &#8220;chamber of
death,&#8221; and during the whole time must pretend to be dead,
whilst the necrophilist satisfies himself sexually by various acts.
Cases of such a nature are reported by de Sade, Neri, Taxil,
Tarnowsky, etc.</p>

<p>Closely allied to these necrophilist tendencies is the remarkable
&#8220;<b>Venus statuaria</b>,&#8221; <b>the love for and sexual intercourse with
statues and other representations of the human person</b>. Here
also, apart from certain <b>aesthetic</b>
<span class="nowrap">motives,<a id="FNanchor657"></a><a href="#Footnote657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></span> which may predominate
in the case of statues of exceptional artistic perfection, we have to
do, for the most part, with the same motives that give rise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page648">[648]</span>
necrophilia&mdash;sadistic, masochistic, and fetichistic. In the case
of individuals who are sexually extremely excitable, a walk
through a museum containing many statues may suffice to give
rise to libido. Of this we have examples. Generally, however,
we have to do with immature, youthful, and, above all, <b>uncultured</b>
individuals, who are devoid of all &aelig;sthetic sensibility,
and have grown up also in a state of prudery and horror of
the nude. It is of similar persons that the Catholic moral
theologian Bouvier speaks, when, in his &#8220;Manuel des Confesseurs&#8221;
(Verviers, 1876), he discusses the case of masturbation
before a statue of the Holy Virgin. We have previously
given examples of the fact that direct sexual intercourse with
a statue occurs as part of a religious fetichism and phallus cult
(<a href="#Page101">p. 101</a>). In such cases the statue is taken for the divinity,
but in a profane statue-love it is taken for the living human being,
as in the celebrated case of the gardener who attempted coitus
with the statue of the Venus of Milo. The idea of the life of the
statue is even more distinctly manifest in the so-called &#8220;<b>pygmalionism</b>,&#8221;
an imitation of the ancient legend of Pygmalion and
Galatea, and a utilization of this legend for erotic ends. Naked
living women, in such cases, stand as &#8220;statues&#8221; upon suitable
pedestals, and are watched by the pygmalionist, whereupon they
gradually come to life. The whole scene induces sexual enjoyment
in the pygmalionist, who is generally an old, outworn debauchee.
Canler has described such practices as going on in Parisian
brothels, on one occasion three prostitutes appearing respectively
as the goddesses Venus, Minerva, and
<span class="nowrap">Juno.<a id="FNanchor658"></a><a href="#Footnote658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></span></p>

<p>In this connexion we may refer to fornicatory acts effected with
<b>artificial imitations</b> of the human body, or of individual parts of
that body. There exist true Vaucansons in this province of
pornographic technology, clever mechanics who, from rubber and
other plastic materials, prepare entire male or female bodies,
which, as <i>hommes</i> or <i>dames de voyage</i>, subserve fornicatory purposes.
More especially are the genital organs represented in a
manner true to nature. Even the secretion of Bartholin&#8217;s glands
is imitated, by means of a &#8220;pneumatic tube&#8221; filled with oil.
Similarly, by means of fluid and suitable apparatus, the ejaculation
of the semen is imitated. Such artificial human beings are
actually offered for sale in the catalogue of certain manufacturers
of &#8220;Parisian rubber articles.&#8221; A more precise account of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page649">[649]</span>
&#8220;fornicatory dolls&#8221; is given by Schwaebl&eacute; (&#8220;Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es de
Paris,&#8221; pp. 247-263). The most astonishing thing in this department
is an erotic romance (&#8220;La Femme Endormie,&#8221; by Madame
B.; Paris, 1899), the love heroine of which is such an artificial
doll, which, as the author in the introduction tells us, can be employed
for all possible sexual artificialities, without, like a living
woman, resisting them in any way. The book is an incredibly
intricate and detailed exposition of this idea.</p>

<p>A comparatively common sexual aberration is &#8220;<b>exhibitionism</b>,&#8221;
first described by <span class="nowrap">Las&egrave;gue,<a id="FNanchor659"></a><a href="#Footnote659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></span>
the exposure of the genital organs,
or other naked parts of the body, or the performance of sexual
acts <b>in public places</b>, either in order, by the public exposure, to produce
sexual excitement, or else as a result of the blind yielding to
sexual impulse, regardless of the fact of publicity. In these cases
we have <b>almost always</b> to do with a <b>morbid</b> phenomenon, dependent
upon <b>epileptic</b> or other mental disorders. Thus, Seiffer, among
eighty-six exhibitionists, found eighteen epileptics, seventeen
dements, thirteen &#8220;degenerates,&#8221; eight neurasthenics, eight
alcoholics, eleven &#8220;habitual&#8221; exhibitionists, and in ten cases
<b>various</b> other morbid conditions. Of the eighty-six cases, eleven
concerned persons of the female
<span class="nowrap">sex.<a id="FNanchor660"></a><a href="#Footnote660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></span> Recently, Burgl, in a
careful and critical work upon
<span class="nowrap">exhibitionism,<a id="FNanchor661"></a><a href="#Footnote661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></span> has suggested the
terms &#8220;exhibition&#8221; and &#8220;exhibitionism,&#8221; the former to be
employed to denote an <b>isolated</b> act of exhibition, the latter to
denote the <b>repeated</b> or <b>customary</b> act of exposure of the genital
organs <i>coram publico</i>. This distinction is important, because
exhibition occurs in mentally healthy persons, as well as in those
suffering from mental disorder; exhibitionism, on the other hand,
is, if we except extremely rare instances in debauchees not suffering
from mental disorder, met with only in insane or mentally
defective individuals.</p>

<p>In the case of these latter we have always to do with the actions
of weak-minded persons; or with impulsive actions in persons in a
state of epileptic or alcoholic confusion; or, finally, with coercive
ideas in neurasthenic or hysterical persons, in paranoia, in general
paralysis of the insane, or in some other form of insanity. But
cases of exhibition or exhibitionism may sometimes occur from
other motives in more or less healthy persons. Among the Slavonic<span class="pagenum" id="Page650">[650]</span>
peoples, exposure of the genital organs or of the buttocks is frequently
an expression of <b>contempt</b> towards some one, or also an
act of <b>superstition</b> (Krauss). Exhibitionism as a <b>popular custom</b>
occurred at medieval festivals, and also in connexion with the
&#8220;obscene gestures&#8221; of the
<span class="nowrap">ancients.<a id="FNanchor662"></a><a href="#Footnote662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></span> By <b>habituation in early
childhood</b> the tendency to exhibitionism can be favoured, we
learn from the case reported by von
<span class="nowrap">Schrenck-Notzing,<a id="FNanchor663"></a><a href="#Footnote663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></span> in which
the person concerned had as a boy taken part in childish games
in which the children passed by one another with bared genital
organs. In his monograph upon the anomalies of the sexual
impulse, which abounds in fine touches, Hoche (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 488)
very rightly refers to the manner in which the exhibitionist tendency
is favoured by habitual <b>masturbation</b>. Through the practice
of masturbation the <b>sense of shame in respect to one&#8217;s own body</b>
is certainly destroyed, and thus, in the case of an onanist, when
some unusual impulse impells him, for example, to expose his
genital organs in the presence of a person of the other sex, <b>certain
powerful inhibitory impulses are lacking</b>, which, in non-onanists,
would immediately overcome this impulse.</p>

<p>Of the two following cases of exhibitionism, that of a homosexual
officer, twenty-five years of age, is certainly the most
remarkable. In youth this patient had also masturbated to
great excess, and he gives the following report of his exhibitionist
tendencies:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;As a boy seven to ten years of age (that is, before I began to masturbate),
it was a pleasure to me to go barefoot, and to show myself
to others in this way. This impulse suddenly disappeared. But at
about the age of fifteen or sixteen years (the time when I began to
masturbate) this impulse reappeared, and has continued down to the
present time. Inasmuch as time and opportunity were generally
wanting, I could only satisfy these desires in my own home, when I
went home on furlough. Since in the neighbourhood of my home I
was very well known, I endeavoured by taking extremely long walks,
or by little journeys to neighbouring parts, to reach places where I
might hope to remain unrecognized. I was accustomed on these
occasions to wear a shooting jacket and knickerbockers; the knickerbockers
were wide and loose, and of as thin cloth as possible, so that
I could easily roll them up in order that my thighs might be bare
(for if the thighs remained covered the whole affair would have given
me no pleasure). Further, on these occasions I was accustomed to
wear no ordinary underclothing, but only a nightshirt. As soon as I
reached the desired place, and had hidden the jacket, stockings, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page651">[651]</span>
shoes in a suitable place, the nightshirt was arranged as a blouse.
Usually I had beforehand tried the arrangement of the dress at home.
Often I went up to people who were engaged in field labours (I
was especially fond of haymakers), and begged them to allow me to help
them, which they were usually willing enough to do. I then took off
my coat and bared my feet, and then, although there seemed no
apparent reason for that, I took off my knickerbockers, until ultimately
I was in the costume above described. I must, however, as already
said, <b>be seen</b>; common people or workmen had usually to suffice me;
but when people of education (for example, visitors at health resorts)
saw me, this was what I greatly preferred. When once one gentleman
said to another, &#8216;Look at his beautiful legs! what lovely legs he has!&#8217;
and I heard this by chance, I was extremely happy. I was then
eighteen years of age, but even now I look back upon that incident
with great pleasure. I also <b>loved to show myself entirely naked</b>; in
such cases I always remained quite close to a pond or a stream, in order,
if necessary, to be able to make the excuse that I had just been bathing.
Frequently, however, I lay down close to a railway in a suitable place
quite naked in an artistic posture, and enjoyed the pleasure of seeing
the trains go by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I commonly did this only in warm, fine weather; but I also did it
sometimes in snowy weather. When going about like this in very
little clothing, or entirely naked, I had extremely agreeable sensations.
The affair usually ended in my masturbating until ejaculation
occurred; <b>after which I returned, as it were, to reality. Otherwise
I believe I should never have been able to bring myself to resume
my normal clothing. For in this state I was almost insensitive to
hunger, thirst, fatigue, heat, etc.; it was, in fact, a trance-like, extremely
happy state.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;The desire to be photographed naked came later. I should have
been extremely delighted to play the part of a naked model. I tried
with great energy in various places (Vienna, Leipzig, and Hamburg)
to get such a photograph as I wanted; but I was always turned away
with a shrug of the shoulders or a shake of the head. Finally I succeeded
in Erfurt, at a small photographer&#8217;s, in having my wish fulfilled.&#8221;
(The patient sent a copy of this photograph.)</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>As the description clearly shows, we have here to do with exhibitionism
upon an epileptic or neurasthenic basis. The patient
describes the &#8220;confusional state,&#8221; out of which he awakens to
&#8220;reality,&#8221; very vividly. An objection, however, to the idea of
epilepsy is to be found in his very complete memory of these
transactions.</p>

<p>Without doubt, in the following case, reported by von Schrenck-Notzing
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 96), we have to do with a case of neurasthenic
exhibitionism:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The patient, a portrait-painter thirty-one years of age, was accused
in the law-courts of repeated acts of exhibitionism. The imagination
and sensuality of the accused have been abnormally excitable since
earliest youth. For the last twenty years he has masturbated to excess<span class="pagenum" id="Page652">[652]</span>
almost every day, with imaginative representation, when masturbating,
of male and female genital organs. In coitus he obtained no gratification.
He preferred to expose his own genital organs to persons of
the female sex, in the belief that he would in this way produce in them
sexual excitement. This exhibitionism is a central point in his sexual
life, and has acquired the character of a coercive impulse. He is
profoundly neurasthenic, and exhibits extensive changes of character,
loss of energy, lachrymosity, ideas of suicide, etc. Exhibits signs of
mental weakness. Exhibitionism is to him a complete equivalent to
ordinary sexual enjoyment, and is performed owing to an organic
compulsion. Ethically, his personality is weakened. The accused
was discharged on account of greatly diminished criminal responsibility.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>As a sub-variety of exhibitionists, we must refer to the so-called
&#8220;<b>frotteurs</b>,&#8221; individuals who rub their genital organs, either bared
or covered, against persons of the opposite sex, and thus obtain
sexual gratification. In their case also we almost always have
to do with morbid conditions. The following case (<i>Vossische
Zeitung</i>, No. 258, June 6, 1906) was recently observed in Berlin:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The architect, Eduard P., was accused of offences committed in
the opera-house of Berlin. In February and March, 1906, he had
repeatedly soiled ladies&#8217; clothing in a disgusting manner. At a time
when the ladies had their whole attention directed to the stage, the
offender, standing or sitting behind them, contaminated their clothing,
and disappeared in the next interval. The whole mode of procedure
suggested the activity of a man with an abnormal morbid predisposition,
who in this place yielded to certain perverse impulses. Several complaints
having been made, some detectives were dispersed through the
audience, until finally the accused was caught in the act. During the
second act of a performance of &#8220;Lohengrin,&#8221; the detective Brumme
observed the accused pressing up from behind against a lady, and, in
the semi-obscurity of the performance, acting in the manner already
mentioned. P. was arrested, and admitted that he had repeatedly
acted in this way. Before the judge the accused also confessed that
he had done the same thing on other occasions. How he had been
led to do it he could not say. Each time after committing the offence
he had suffered very bitter remorse.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The accused was acquitted of the criminal charge on the
ground of mental disorder.</p>

<p>The psychical element of exhibitionism also plays a part in
the practice of the so-called
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>voyeurs</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor664"></a><a href="#Footnote664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></span>
and &#8220;<b>voyeuses</b>,&#8221; that
numerous group of male and female individuals who are sexually<span class="pagenum" id="Page653">[653]</span>
excited by <b>regarding</b> the sexual acts of other persons (active
<i>voyeurs</i>), or who <b>allow themselves to be watched</b> by others when
themselves performing sexual acts (passive <i>voyeurs</i>). In many
brothels, apertures in the wall or other arrangements have been
made for these <i>voyeurs</i> or <i>gagas</i>, through which they watch sexual
scenes. In fashionable dressmakers&#8217; shops, men are also said to
watch ladies trying on dresses&mdash;at least, so I have been informed
by a Parisian. Recently women also have been more and more
inclined to see such spectacles, so that Schwaebl&eacute; devotes a special
chapter to the <i>voyeuses</i> in his book on the perverse women of
Paris. Messalina compelled her court ladies to prostitute themselves
in her presence. Not infrequently male and female
<i>voyeurs</i> unite to form societies and <b>secret sexual clubs</b>, in which
all the sexual acts are performed in public.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Thus, in the end of September, 1906, in Graz, a &#8220;Secret Society
for Immoral Purposes&#8221; was discovered by the police. At the head
of this club was a merchant, thirty years of age, <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> jun. A number
of other persons of good position belonged to this sexual club. They
met in the great restaurant &#8220;Zum K&ouml;nigstiger.&#8221; Under the title of
&#8220;An Assembly of Beauty,&#8221; festivals were held in the magnificent
garden of this restaurant, which were concluded as orgies behind
closed doors. The beautiful gardens of the Schlossberg were also the
scene of many meetings of the
<span class="nowrap">club.<a id="FNanchor665"></a><a href="#Footnote665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A remarkable category of <i>voyeurs</i> is constituted by the so-called
&#8220;<b>stercoraires</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>platoniques</b>,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor666"></a><a href="#Footnote666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></span>
individuals who obtain sexual enjoyment
by observing the acts of def&aelig;cation and micturition
performed by persons of the other sex, and seek opportunities
for such observations in brothels or public lavatories. In the
closet of one of the Berlin railway-stations such a <i>stercoraire</i>
recently made a small artificial opening in the wall, through
which he was able to watch other persons when engaged in the
act of def&aelig;cation!</p>

<p>Here also we may refer to <b>heterosexual p&aelig;dication</b>, to <i>coitus
analis</i>, which, according to the reports of French authors (Tardieu,
Martineau, and Taxil), appears to be especially common in France,
but which is by no means rare also in other countries. It becomes
comprehensible only in view of the fact that the anus may itself
be an erogenic zone. Details regarding this matter are given
by <span class="nowrap">Freud.<a id="FNanchor667"></a><a href="#Footnote667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></span>
Krauss, also, in the second volume of his &#8220;Anthropophyteia&#8221;
(p. 392 <i>et seq.</i>), has given numerous examples of<span class="pagenum" id="Page654">[654]</span>
p&aelig;dication. Among others, he reports two cases related to him
by the ethnologist Friedrich M&uuml;ller, in which men had coitus
with their wives only <i>per anum</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, we must refer to a practice which appears to be confined
to France, the <b>customary use of opium, hashish, and
ether, for the purpose of inducing sexual excitement</b>, regarding
which Schwaebl&eacute; (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 19-36) and d&#8217;Estoc (<i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 151-158) give very interesting reports. There exist in Paris
special opium-houses, hashish-houses, and ether-houses, some
for men and some for women. Three opium-houses are to be
found, for example, in the Avenue Hoche, the Avenue J&eacute;na, and
the Rue Lauriston; there is an ether-restaurant in Neuilly; one
for opium, hashish, and ether in the Rue de Rivoli. All these
means of enjoyment evoke after a time sexual ideas and fantasies
of an extremely peculiar character, associated with actual voluptuous
sensations. Opium gives rise to &#8220;ardent, brilliant pictures
of an excessively stimulated
<span class="nowrap">imagination,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor668"></a><a href="#Footnote668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></span>
frequently of a perverse
character; hashish has a similar but even stronger
influence; and ether gives rise to a more powerful stimulation
of the sexual organs, to a &#8220;vibration of the flesh and of the soul.&#8221;
The interior of these unwholesome places of exotic enjoyment,
in which frequently homosexual acts also occur, is vividly described
by both the above-named French
<span class="nowrap">authors.<a id="FNanchor669"></a><a href="#Footnote669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></span></p>

<h3>APPENDIX<br />
THE TREATMENT OF SEXUAL PERVERSIONS</h3>

<p>In the treatment of sexual perversions and anomalies, always
a matter of great difficulty, knowledge of mankind, tact, and the
finer understanding of the physician for the psychological peculiarities
of each individual case, must play a greater part than any
definite method of medical treatment. An exact understanding
of the true <b>nature</b> of the sexually abnormal personality is the
indispensable preliminary to our exercising a favourable influence
upon morbid impulses and practices. Unquestionably, the
physician must in the first place treat all <b>actual diseases underlying
the sexual abnormalities</b>, by means of the physical and
pharmacological therapeutical methods open to us in such
abundance. Bodily and mental <b>repose</b> is here often the first
need we have to satisfy; and for this purpose a change of environment,
climatic cures, and such drugs as bromide and camphor
may be very useful. But the principal matter must remain
<b>psychical, suggestive</b> treatment. The mere <b>discussion</b> of the
matter with the physician, the possibility at length of confiding
in one capable of taking a thoroughly objective, calm, comprehensive
view of the matter, one who by his profession is instructed
in all secrets of the human spiritual and impulsive life, and who
is aware of all the bodily necessities&mdash;this by itself suffices to
restore to these unhappy beings, who are tortured by the evil
demon of their unhappy impulse, who are often in a state of
spiritual despair and hypochondria, to restore to them an inward
confidence and a healing repose. This is the great triumph of
medical research in this hitherto tabooed, and yet so enormously
important, department, which only crass ignorance or evil-minded
hypocrisy could designate as &#8220;improper&#8221; or &#8220;unworthy.&#8221;
We have passed beyond the fruitless and dangerous method of
&#8220;moral preaching,&#8221; to attain a <b>scientific understanding</b> of sexual
anomalies; we have exposed the roots of these anomalies, lying
deep in the physical and psychical nature of humanity, and we
have recognized their connexion with so many other phenomena
of the civilization of our time. When I speak of a &#8220;treatment&#8221;
of the common, widely diffused sexual anomalies, it appears to
me that that standpoint is the best which regards them as pure
<b>diseases of the will</b>, which have been diffused in all times, but have
never been more distinctly manifest, and never have possessed
more importance, than they do at the present day, when will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page656">[656]</span>
energy, has become the most important weapon in the ever more
violent struggle for existence. As Napoleon III. said, it is not
to the apathetic man, but to the <b>energetic</b> man, that the future
belongs, to the man with the will of iron. But nothing paralyzes
the will so much as the dominance of blind and, above all, of
<b>abnormal</b>, impulses. Unquestionably they conceal within themselves,
when frequently gratified, feelings rather of pain than of
pleasure, and become the unconquerable source of hypochondria
and self-contempt. The stronger the impulse becomes, the longer
the habit has lasted of yielding to that impulse, the greater is the
loss of will from which the individual suffers. The first and most
important task of the physician is, therefore, to weaken the
impulse by means of strengthening the will. He must consistently
and methodically <b>educate the will</b>, in order to assist the
patient to obtain the victory over his impulse. As Goethe says
in his &#8220;Epimenides&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&#8220;Noch ist vieles zu erf&uuml;llen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Noch ist manches nicht vorbei:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doch wir alle, durch den <b>Willen</b><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sind wir schon von Banden frei.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[&#8220;Much there remains to fulfil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Many things have yet to be endured:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still, all of us, by the exercise of <b>will</b><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can to a large extent free ourselves from our fetters.&#8221;]<br /></span>
</div>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>The best way to attain this is to employ <b>personal influence</b>
by means of <b>suggestion</b>. We must recommend frequent <b>conversations</b>
on the part of the patient with the physician, which
can be powerfully supplemented by <b>epistolary communications</b>
on the part of the physician, of which an excellent example will
be found in the &#8220;Psychotherapeutic Letters&#8221; by H. Oppenheim
(Berlin, <span class="nowrap">1906).<a id="FNanchor670"></a><a href="#Footnote670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></span> <b>Hypnosis</b>
is also of value, although it does not
appear to do any more in these cases than is effected by
suggestion in the waking <span class="nowrap">state.<a id="FNanchor671"></a><a href="#Footnote671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not so easy to transform a Hamlet into a man of action.
We must impose tasks upon the will, tasks both mental and
physical; we must regulate the mode of life; we must give to
the individuality special prescriptions adapted to the particular
case, and we must call to our assistance, whenever advisable,
the friends and associates of our patient. The great enemy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page657">[657]</span>
the will, alcohol, must be absolutely prohibited; on the other
hand, the taste for finer enjoyment and also for easy sports
and pastimes must be <span class="nowrap">stimulated.<a id="FNanchor672"></a><a href="#Footnote672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></span>
The <i>vita sexualis</i> needs
repose in every case, and, above all, masturbation must be
energetically resisted. If we succeed in diminishing the intensity
of the impulse, and in increasing the power of the will, we have
already done much. In isolated cases, we must also always make
the attempt to conduct the libido and its activity very gradually
into normal channels, perhaps with the assistance of suggestive
ideas <i>in coitu</i>, for which, above all, the assistance of the sexual
partner is indispensable. Only an experienced physician can here
hit the mark.</p>

Such relations can become actual, even at the present day, as we learn from
the case reported by the Public Prosecutor, Dr. Kersten, in the <i>Archives for
Criminal Anthropology</i> (1904, vol. xvi., p. 330), of a Moor, sixty-five years of
age, who, in intercourse with his step-daughter, procreated a daughter, and later
with this daughter of his own, when she was thirteen years of age, had sexual
intercourse!</p>

German authors use the word <i>Sodomie</i> to denote sexual relationships
between human beings and animals. Mr. Havelock Ellis informs me (in a
private letter) &#8220;the German use of &#8216;sodomy&#8217; to include &#8216;bestiality&#8217; is quite
ancient, and no doubt had a theological origin. I imagine the confusion was
made with the idea of throwing on to &#8216;bestiality&#8217; the same reprobation as the
Bible metes out to &#8216;sodomy.&#8217;&#8221; There is, of course, no mention of bestiality in
connexion with the destruction of Sodom. The sin for which the city was
destroyed was the desire for carnal knowledge of the two angels in the house
of Lot (Gen. xix. 5). The signification of the various terms used to denote
unnatural intercourse is thus defined by Mann, in his work on &#8220;Forensic
Medicine&#8221;: <b>Sodomy</b> means unnatural sexual intercourse between two human
beings, usually of the male sex.... <b>Tribadism</b>, the gratification of the sexual
instinct between two human beings of the female sex.... <b>Pederastia</b> is that
form of sodomy in which the passive r&ocirc;le is played by a boy, the active agent
being man or boy. <b>Bestiality</b> means sexual intercourse between mankind and
the lower animals. Generally speaking, in this translation the terms mentioned
are used as above defined. If there is any variation from that use, the
context will manifest it. In any case, <b>Sodomy</b> has never been employed in the
translation as an equivalent of the German <i>Sodomie</i>, the latter term having
been invariably rendered by <b>Bestiality</b>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

and critical study of unnatural fornication with animals is published by
Haberda in the <i>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r Gerichtliche Medizin</i>, 1907, vol. xxxiii., supplementary
number. It deals with 162 medico-legal cases. Among these, two only
concern girls of sixteen and twenty-nine years of age respectively, persons who
have had improper relations with dogs. Most of the male offenders were <b>persons
whose occupations brought them much into contact with domestic animals</b>;
about half of them were under twenty years of age. The animals concerned were
cattle, goats, horses, dogs, pigs, sheep, and hens. In the majority of cases there
were fornicatory acts&mdash;acts analogous to sexual intercourse&mdash;less commonly
other sexual contacts. The girl of sixteen was caught in the act of intercourse
with a dog. The majority of male offenders made use of female animals. In
two cases young men allowed dogs to have intercourse with them <i>per anum</i>, the
dogs having been trained to do this, and in both of them were found lacerations
of the anus and rectum. Only in a few of the 172 cases of bestiality was there
any reason to doubt the mental integrity of the person concerned. In those
cases there was senile dementia, epilepsy, or alcoholism. The principal causes
for the practice of bestiality were enhanced opportunities, the lack of possibility
in the country for conjugal or extra-conjugal normal sexual intercourse, or,
finally, superstition (belief in the possibility of curing of venereal disease by
intercourse with animals).</p>

The following authentic case, which occurred in the year 1902, appears
to be unique. A man compelled his wife, who was amiable but somewhat
weak-minded, to have intercourse with a male pointer, which he himself prepared
for the act, and in course of time he made the animal complete coitus with his
wife five or six times whilst he looked on (&#8220;A Horrible Case,&#8221; published in
the <i>Archives for Criminal Anthropology</i>, vol. xiii., pp. 320, 321). A case of
bestiality with a rabbit is reported by Bo&euml;teau (&#8220;Un Cas de Bestialit&eacute;,&#8221; published
in <i>France M&eacute;dicale</i>, 1891, vol. xxxviii., p. 593). Regarding passive bestiality

The belief in vampires is in part dependent upon necrophilia. In Southern
Slavonic countries the corpses of young women and girls were sometimes found
which had been disinterred. The necrophilist had misused them sexually, and
had then cut off the breasts and torn out the intestines (F. S. Krauss, &#8220;Anthropophyteia,&#8221;
vol. ii., p. 391). In the fifth decade of the nineteenth century the
notorious necrophilist Sergeant Bertrand performed similar acts.</p>

Reported by A. Eulenburg, &#8220;Sadism and Masochism,&#8221; p. 56. Another case
of necrophilia, with subsequent mutilation, occurred during the night of
December 21-22, 1901, in the mortuary at Weiher, on the corpse of the wife of a
day-labourer. The offender, who was arrested, had, on account of intense
sexual hyper&aelig;sthesia, committed other sexual offences, among them bestiality
(<i>cf.</i> &#8220;A Case of Necrophilia,&#8221; published in the <i>Archives of Criminal Anthropology</i>,

The following interesting reports, given by A. Wernichs (&#8220;Geographico-Medical
Studies,&#8221; pp. 48-50), elucidate very exactly the nature of the sexual
fantasies of the opium-smoker, which have the character of an indeterminate
and by no means coercive sexual desire: &#8220;It is not necessary to proceed to gratification;
one is almost disinclined to bring the series of beautiful pictures to an
end in this way. All the joyful sexual experiences follow one another in a peculiar
and fanciful admixture. Alluring forms appear in the most stimulating postures.
Often one does not seem to take part in the matter oneself. Beautiful women
whom one has seen in any part of the world, at the theatre, etc., move before one&#8217;s
eyes, in the most beloved games of our youth. Everything that memory and the
half-dream brings us is naked, shining, delicate, luxurious&mdash;and for us alone;
for me these groupings, these fountains with bathing forms, these gestures, these
embraces.&#8221; It is, therefore, not simply by chance that the majority of Chinese
brothels have arrangements for opium-smokers, and that, contrariwise, many
opium-dens provide opportunities for sexual enjoyment. Indeed, prostitutes are
said to prefer opium-smokers, precisely because the latter, as long as the effect
of the opium persists, do not come to an end of their enjoyment.</p>

<p>[These sexual fantasies of the opium-smoker probably occur only in the
initial stages of indulgence in the drug. The <b>confirmed</b> opium-smoker, like the
man habituated to the hypodermic injection of morphine, is probably, with rare
exceptions, completely impotent. Sexual appetite and power return, however,
when the habit is cured.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span>]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is the evident duty of the State to protect society from certain
manifestations of the sexual impulse, occurring publicly in the
form of &#8220;<b>offences against morality</b>,&#8221; and whenever these manifestations
<b>interfere</b> with the persons and the rights of citizens.
The sexual impulse has been compared with a powerful stream,
which, when confined to its natural bed, is a never-ending source
of blessing to the surrounding country; but which, as soon as
with elemental force it overflows its banks and gives rise to
widespread floods, is the cause of unspeakable misery among the
entire <span class="nowrap">population.<a id="FNanchor673"></a><a href="#Footnote673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></span>
This comparison would be just if the facts
were as stated. But, as I have already pointed out, <b>as a whole</b>,
sexual perversions have played a far smaller part in the decadence
of fallen nations than has hitherto been assumed. The biological
and economical history of civilization has taught us to recognize
numerous other influences, which, in such a process of national
decay, play at least as great a part as sexual &#8220;degeneration,&#8221;
and in many cases a much greater part than this. Frequently,
indeed, sexual perversions and unnatural modes of gratification
of the sexual impulse are <b>in the first place a consequence of
economic and social abnormalities</b>, and are intimately connected
with the so-called social problem. The above-named stream,
to pursue the image, only trickles over its banks here and there,
without giving rise to any widespread and devastating flood.
And so long as these destructive tendencies are wanting, the State
has no right to take measures against sexual perversions, or at
most can justly do so only by dealing with their social causes.
In view of the extensive diffusion of sexual anomalies among
persons who in other respects are perfectly healthy, we must ask
ourselves whether the importance of these anomalies, in respect of
the offences against morality to which in certain circumstances they<span class="pagenum" id="Page662">[662]</span>
may give rise, has not been overestimated. This idea has recently
been put forward by J. Salg&oacute;, in his valuable monograph, &#8220;The
Forensic Importance of Sexual Perversities&#8221; (Halle, 1907). I
am more especially pleased to find that this author shares the view
which I have myself advocated for years, that sexual perversities
in the majority of cases are not indications of &#8220;degeneration,&#8221;
as has been assumed both by psychiatrists and neurologists,
especially under the influence of the doctrine of M&ouml;bius, who
pushed this idea much too far. Moreover, the late Jolly, in his
lectures to practising physicians upon sexual aberrations, expressly
maintained the justice of my view of sexual anomalies as
an anthropological phenomenon. With regard to the nature of
sexual perversions, psychiatric science will have greatly to
modify its general views, in order to attain an objective consideration
of their significance.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;<b>Psychiatry</b>,&#8221; says Salg&oacute; (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 37, 38), &#8220;<b>must not follow the
decoy-call of the law (which has wandered into a blind alley), by endeavouring
to cover with the mantle of specialist science the serious
legal errors in the matter of perverse sexuality. The incontestable
domain of psychiatric experience in forensic questions is already sufficiently
large, and it needs no artificial extension. But it is an artificial
extension to indicate as morbid all the aberrations of sexual activity,
or any single one of such aberrations, in the absence of indubitable
or demonstrable symptoms of physical disturbance, and in the absence
of a clearly recognizable and abnormal course&mdash;simply because they
contravene the existing criminal law.</b>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The blind alley of psychiatry is the prison and the asylum.
Because psychiatry is principally concerned with those sexual
perversities which have criminal or psychiatric importance, with
the <b>abnormalities</b> and the <b>crimes</b> of the sexually perverse, psychiatric
science failed to recognize the extraordinarily wide diffusion
of sexual perversions among persons who are mentally and physically
healthy. Among the healthy, homosexuality, sadism,
masochism, fetichism, etc., may make their appearance in more
or less severe forms; just as other &#8220;vicious habits&#8221; may occur
in the healthy, just as passionate tobacco-smoking, or intoxication
with any sport, may become <b>an ineradicable habit</b>, or at least a
<b>habit extremely difficult to eradicate</b>. Neither jurisprudence nor
psychiatry can be spared the accusation of having misled &#8220;public
opinion,&#8221; this terrible monster so often hostile to civilization, in
respect of sexual perversities, regarding whose nature recent
scientific research, and above all, anthropological research, has
diffused a light. <b>I am acquainted with a number of persons
whose bodily and mental health is excellent, persons who are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page663">[663]</span>
indeed, imposing in respect of their primeval German racial force,
who have assured me that they suffer from the most severe sexual
perversions!</b> Recall the description given on <a href="#Page584">p. 584</a> of a masochistic
&#8220;slave&#8221; of the most extreme type. I do not go so far
as Salg&oacute;, who demands for sexual anomalies, in so far as they are
not criminal, the same &#8220;right of existence&#8221; (<a href="#Page7">p. 7</a>) as for the
normal sexual impulse; but I do assert that sexual anomalies
exist in individuals who are in other respects perfectly healthy,
and that they do not always injure the personal health or the
bodily and moral well-being of another, as is the case with sexual
perversions arising upon a morbid foundation and attaining
forensic importance. Above all, I must sharply condemn the
fashion of <b>glorifying</b> sexual perversities, which have been regarded
as a peculiar privilege of the highest mental development, and as
corresponding to an especial refinement of sensibility. This
assertion may be refuted by reference to the fact, often mentioned
before, that the most incredible and most artificial sexual malpractices
occur among savage races, who in this respect could
give points to our modern decadents and epicurean &aelig;sthetes.
In any case, sexual perversions in themselves have neither a
moral nor a forensic importance, and must be regarded as more
or less biological variations of the normal impulse.</p>

<p>Where, on the other hand, the <b>public</b> or <b>individual</b> interest is
injured by these perversions, the State has unquestionably the
right of intervention and the right of prevention. In every case
in which we have to do with the production of a public nuisance,
with the bodily or mental injury of other human beings, with
the employment of force, with the misuse of the lessened or
absent responsibility of children, of unconscious persons, of those
asleep, and of those mentally disordered, society must intervene
in its own interest, and must take suitable measures to protect
itself against such offences. Now, it is certain&mdash;and to have
established this is an honour to psychiatric science&mdash;that it is
precisely these latter sexual <b>offences</b> which in the great majority
of cases are committed by <b>diseased</b> persons and by those who are
more or less <b>irresponsible</b>. Therefore, we are thoroughly justified
in demanding that in every such criminal case, the bodily and
mental condition of the accused should be subjected to a medical
examination. A typical mental disorder, such as imbecility,
epilepsy, alcoholic insanity, general paralysis of the insane,
paranoia, etc., will be detected without difficulty, and thereby
responsibility will at once be excluded. More difficult are the
<b>transitional</b> stages between health and disease, the so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page664">[664]</span>
&#8220;<b>borderland cases</b>,&#8221; the cases of &#8220;psychopathically deficient
responsibility&#8221; and of &#8220;disequilibrium.&#8221; In forensic medicine
two ideas play a very great part in this connexion, that of &#8220;<b>degeneration</b>&#8221;
and that of &#8220;<b>diminished responsibility</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every sexually perverse person must be examined for signs of
severe hereditary taint, as well as for the so-called &#8220;stigmata
of degeneration.&#8221; If we can prove that in his family there have
been <b>several</b> instances of <b>severe</b> mental disorder, of alcoholism,
syphilis, diabetes, and other diseases leading to degeneration, the
suspicion that there is a psychopathic foundation for the sexual
offence is justified. But we must insist that congenital taint does
not make itself felt in every case, and cannot, therefore, always
be made responsible as a causal influence in the production of

<p>The so-called &#8220;stigmata of degeneration&#8221; have importance only
when they are <b>very markedly</b> developed, and when <b>several</b> of
them are simultaneously present. We distinguish physical and
mental <i>stigmata degenerationis</i>. To the former belong disturbances
and inhibitions of development, malformations, such
as asymmetry of the skull, narrowness of the palate, hare-lip,
cleft palate, anomalies of the teeth and the hair, difficulties of
speech, tic convulsif, abnormal and morbid states of the genital
organs and genital functions, and more especially malformations
of the ear, such as Morel&#8217;s ear (the complete or partial absence of
the helix or antihelix), the Darwinian pointed ear,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a id="FNanchor675"></a><a href="#Footnote675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></span></p>

<p>The mental degenerative phenomena comprise all that are
known as &#8220;bizarre or abnormal&#8221; characters; those who possess
such characters are termed &#8220;eccentrics&#8221; and &#8220;originals,&#8221; or
are known as persons &#8220;psychopathically below par&#8221; (J. L. A.
Koch), as &#8220;disequilibrated&#8221; (Eschle), as &#8220;superior degenerates&#8221;
(Magnan). These phenomena comprise peculiar disturbances
of the harmony of the spiritual life, characterized by lack<span class="pagenum" id="Page665">[665]</span>
of balance between emotion and intellect, as well as by an abnormal
irritability and undue reaction to stimulation. We may
find complete absence of ethical perception, so-called &#8220;moral
insanity,&#8221; of which E. Kraepelin and his school have proved that
it may arise secondarily as a sequel to certain mental disorders.
Striking in these unbalanced persons is the disharmony of the
entire conduct of life, the internal lack of the <i>point d&#8217;appui</i>, the
unsteadiness, the suddenness of their actions, which often occur
under the influence of coercive ideas and abnormal impulses, the
abnormally early appearance and the extraordinary intensity of
the sexual impulse, the tendency to cruelty (O. Rosenbach). In
judging the personality of the degenerate as a whole, we must
always take into account the <b>entire course of life</b>, to which only
too often the remark of Stifter applies: &#8220;In his life we saw only
beginnings without continuations, and continuations without
beginnings.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must not forget that many of the bodily
stigmata of degeneration occur also in healthy persons, and that
the existence of such stigmata in mentally disordered persons and
in criminals may also be referred to social causes, to bad conditions
of life and deficient nutriment, to alcoholism, syphilis, or
rickets. For this reason P.
<span class="nowrap">N&auml;cke<a id="FNanchor676"></a><a href="#Footnote676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></span>
rightly insists <b>that many of
the so-called stigmata of degeneration are socially produced</b>, and
will therefore disappear with the employment of a purposive
social hygiene; he gives as an example the rachitic bandy legs of
English factory labourers. Therefore, for the proof of degeneration,
we must lay more stress upon <b>mental</b> stigmata, upon abnormality
of the spiritual personality, abnormality of its intellectual
and emotional character, and from this proceed to infer the
irresistible character of a morbid impulsive manifestation.</p>

<p>In addition to the study of the stigmata of degeneration, the
study of <b>tattooing</b> is of forensic importance in the consideration
of the sexual offences; the character and the date of the tattooing
give sometimes interesting information regarding the nature of
the personality.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Thus <span class="nowrap">Lombroso<a id="FNanchor677"></a><a href="#Footnote677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></span>
reports the case of an offender against morality,
fifty years of age, with prominent ears and scanty growth of hair.
This man ravished a girl of fifteen, whose mother was his mistress.
<b>At the early age of fifteen</b> he had had the most obscene pictures tattooed
upon his body; and upon inquiry he stated that he had begun
to masturbate at the age of thirteen years, and had begun to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page666">[666]</span>
intercourse with women at the age of fifteen years. He denied the
accusation of rape, and maintained that he had enjoyed the girl without
using force. <b>His tattooing, however, gave evidence</b> of his capacity
to commit sexual crime. The pictures served as a <b>certain and important
proof of this</b>.</p>

<p>This appeared even more clearly in the case of the ravisher Francesco
Spiteri, published by Dr. F. Santangelo in 1892, <b>whose utterly immoral
and sexually perverse mode of life was most wonderfully displayed
and recorded by means of the tattooings by which his entire body was
covered</b>. It will suffice here to allude to the drawing of a fish and of
seven points upon his membrum. This indicated that his penis
(Italian, <i>pesce</i> = fish) since his youth had p&aelig;dicated seven boys
(= seven points)!</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In the case of sexual offences we have to consider, in addition
to the question of degeneration, that of <b>diminished</b> or <b>entirely
absent responsibility</b>. In cases of unmistakable mental disorder,
responsibility does not exist, nor in epileptic confusional states,
nor in profound alcoholic
<span class="nowrap">intoxication.<a id="FNanchor678"></a><a href="#Footnote678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></span> Between complete
irresponsibility and complete responsibility there are numerous
transitional stages, which are all classified under the idea of
<b>diminished responsibility</b>. This fact is not recognized by &sect; 51
of the Criminal Code, which runs as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;A punishable offence has not been committed when the accused
at the time the action was performed was in a state of unconsciousness,
or in a state or morbid disturbance of mental activity, by means of
which his freedom of will was excluded.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In this we find the idea of &#8220;morbid disturbance of mental
activity,&#8221; which is definitely wider than the idea of mental
disease, in so far as it embraces transient mental disorders in
persons who are not suffering from definite mental disease; but
it does not take into consideration the even more important notion
of diminished responsibility, which is applicable to all the above
described borderland states and transitional conditions lying
between mental health and mental disease. H&auml;ussler (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 39) as long as eighty years ago demanded the recognition of
the idea of diminished responsibility&mdash;that is, of a condition &#8220;in
which responsibility for the action was <b>diminished</b> by an imperfectly
developed intelligence, without the disturbance of intellectual
activity being sufficiently great completely to abolish free
voluntary determination&#8221; (Aschaffenburg). Since that time, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page667">[667]</span>
the address given on September 16, 1887, to the Association of
German Alienists at Frankfort on &#8220;diminished responsibility,&#8221;
Jolly opened a discussion upon this question. In this discussion
the majority of German psychiatrists recommended the legislative
recognition of such an idea, among these Wollenberg, Hoche,
Cramer, Kirn, Aschaffenburg, von Schrenck-Notzing,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a id="FNanchor679"></a><a href="#Footnote679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></span></p>

<p>In connexion with diminished responsibility we must distinguish
between <b>individuals</b> and <b>actions</b>. Among the individuals
recognized above as persons &#8220;psychopathically below par,&#8221;
responsibility may be diminished permanently and for a number of
different actions; but in other cases healthy normal individuals
may exhibit diminished responsibility in respect of <b>isolated
actions</b>, when, for example, an <b>excessively strong emotion</b>, or a
state of <b>acute intoxication</b>, has for a certain time and in relation to
a particular action abrogated responsibility. In this connexion,
in addition to acute alcoholic intoxication, certain <b>sexual</b> processes
have especially to be considered. H&auml;ussler recognized the
influence of the sexual impulse upon responsibility, and considered
that certain actions performed under the influence of that
impulse were performed without complete responsibility, and he
declared that the voluptuary was a person whose mental health
was <span class="nowrap">imperfect.<a id="FNanchor680"></a><a href="#Footnote680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></span>
Forel<a id="FNanchor681"></a><a href="#Footnote681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> also regarded the &#8220;slaves of the sexual
impulse&#8221; as mentally abnormal, as individuals whose responsibility
was diminished. I consider it indisputable that sexual
emotions, especially when they arise suddenly, diminish responsibility,
and limit, to some extent at least, the freedom of voluntary
determination. Regarding certain processes of the <i>vita sexualis</i>,
such as the epoch of <b>puberty</b> in both sexes, regarding <b>menstruation</b>,
<b>pregnancy</b>, and the <b>climacteric in women</b>, this fact has been already
generally recognized. It ought, however, to be admitted regarding
the sexual impulse in general, more especially when the whole
character of the action proves that it has been the consequence
of a suddenly arising powerful emotion. Von Krafft-Ebing
also is of this <span class="nowrap">opinion.<a id="FNanchor682"></a><a href="#Footnote682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></span>
It is, moreover, in most cases possible
to determine whether the offence was caused <b>only by a powerful
sexual emotion</b>, by means of which the intelligence and the freedom
of the will of a person, in other respects normally responsible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page668">[668]</span>
were temporarily limited or completely arrested; or whether
other motives intervened, so that the action must be regarded as
the result of conscious choice.</p>

<p>In conclusion, another point must be considered, which is
related to the question of sexual offences committed with children,
and which possesses forensic importance. This is the circumstance
that in many such cases there is no question of the &#8220;seduction&#8221;
of children, but that, on the contrary, the incitation <b>first</b>
proceeded from the children themselves. In the previous chapter
we discussed the early appearance of sexual activity in children.
Moreover, in such cases we could distinguish between a nobler
and a grosser, more sensual love.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>As an example of the former, I may allude to the ardent, affectionate
love of a girl of twelve for a thoroughly honourable man of forty years
of age, who certainly had no idea of sexual intimacy with the child, and
who was unable to free himself from her passionate caresses. We often
observe such intimate inclinations on the part of young girls towards
mature men, and we must be careful in such cases to avoid immediately
thinking of p&aelig;dophilic unchastity.</p>

<p>In another case a mother complained that her daughter, seven years
of age, was in continual pursuit of a boy of fourteen, and could not be
cured of the affection.</p>

<p>Maria Lischnewska reports (&#8220;Mutterschutz,&#8221; 1905, p. 155) the case
of a boy, not yet six years of age, who drew up the nightgown of his
foster-mother, and endeavoured to have intercourse with her.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The sexual offences committed by clergymen and tutors upon
the girls taught by them are apt to be seen in a different light
when we subject the youthful accuser to a strict cross-examination,
and, in addition, to a physical examination, whereby in many cases
we bring to light the fact that, long <b>before</b> the recent offence,
they have been accustomed <b>of their own free will</b> to have sexual
relations with <b>other</b> men. Casper long ago drew attention to
these circumstances. Very often <b>from the pupil herself proceed
actual advances</b> of the worst kind, which have proved ruinous
to many a young teacher whose morals were previously above
reproach.</p>

<p>Finally, there is an important point which must not be forgotten:
the untrustworthy character of childish evidence, a matter
which has recently been discussed by the specialist Adolf
<span class="nowrap">Baginsky.<a id="FNanchor683"></a><a href="#Footnote683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></span>
This writer, whose knowledge of childish psychology is so
profound, remarks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page669">[669]</span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The evidence given by children in the law-courts appears to those
who are really familiar with the child mind to be <b>absolutely worthless</b>
and <b>utterly devoid of importance</b>, and this is the more the case the
more frequently the child repeats its statement, and the more firmly
it sticks to its evidence.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>He alludes to the law of Sweden, according to which the child
is not competent to give evidence in a law-court before the completion
of its fifteenth year.</p>

<p>All these circumstances must be considered in relation to the
question of the so-called &#8220;<b>age of consent</b>.&#8221; M. Hirschfeld justly
remarks that the natural age of consent is equivalent to that at
which a child is competent to make a choice (&#8220;The Nature of
Love,&#8221; p. 284). I consider that the decision of the Italian
Criminal Code is the best; by this Code the age of consent for
<b>both</b> sexes is placed at the conclusion of the sixteenth year.</p>

<p>The majority of crimes committed from purely sexual motives
belong to the crimes of passion, in the sense of Ferris, and indeed
to crimes committed under the coercion of the most powerful
of organic impulses. I doubt whether the existing punishments
are the most suitable for the purpose for which they are designed.
In any case, gentleness is here above all demanded, and we should
invoke the saying, &#8220;Judge not, that ye be not judged!&#8221; Indeed,
an evangelical <span class="nowrap">minister<a id="FNanchor684"></a><a href="#Footnote684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></span>
speaks truly when he says:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;<b>The enormous majority of men and women, who constitute themselves
the judges of offences against morality, whilst they themselves
take every opportunity of infringing the moral laws they profess to
uphold&mdash;lie day after day, throughout their whole life&mdash;their position
is built upon hypocrisy and lies.</b>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It very rarely happens that a judge who condemns a thief or a
murderer has himself been guilty of this crime, but without
doubt it frequently happens that a judge condemns other men
on account of sexual offences which he has himself committed.
In the case of <b>sexual crimes</b> we almost always have to do with
individuals to whom more good could be done by <b>medical influence</b>
than by imprisonment; we must entrust the physician with
the duty of protecting society against such offenders. &#8220;<b>In this
province, physicians will become the judges of the future</b>,&#8221; says
M. Hirschfeld most <span class="nowrap">justly.<a id="FNanchor685"></a><a href="#Footnote685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></span>
Until this end is attained, let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page670">[670]</span>
remind German judges of an anecdote which I found in an old
French <span class="nowrap">encyclop&aelig;dia:<a id="FNanchor686"></a><a href="#Footnote686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;A courtesan in Madrid killed her lover, on account of his unfaithfulness;
she was condemned and brought before the king, from whom
she hid nothing. The king said to her: &#8216;Thou hast loved <b>too much</b>
to be a reasonable being.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<p class="noindent">There is no disputed question in respect of which the divergent
views are so sharply opposed as they are regarding the importance,
the value, and the consequences of <b>sexual abstinence</b>.</p>

<p>[The question has been recently discussed by O. Schreiber,
in a paper entitled &#8220;Sexual Abstinence,&#8221; published in <i>Medizinische
Bl&auml;tter</i>, 1907, Nos. 25-27.]</p>

<p>I distinguish <b>five</b> groups of opinion:</p>

<p>1. The apostles of <b>absolute asceticism</b> during the whole of
life (Tolstoi, Weininger, Norbert Grabowsky, Kurnig, etc.).</p>

<p>2. The <i>medical</i> advocates of <b>relative temporary continence</b>,
until it becomes possible to enjoy permanent hygienic intercourse,
free from all objections.</p>

<p>3. The advocates of &#8220;<b>duplex sexual morality</b>,&#8221; who demand
from <i>woman</i> sexual abstinence until she marries, but who regard
this as impossible in the case of <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>4. The <span class="nowrap">&#8220;<b>Vera</b>&#8221;<a id="FNanchor687"></a><a href="#Footnote687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></span>
<b>enthusiasts</b>, who on <b>moral</b> grounds demand
abstinence for <b>both</b> sexes until marriage.</p>

<p>5. Those who <b>doubt</b> the possibility of abstinence of <b>any</b> kind
for either sex, whether absolute <b>or</b> relative.</p>

<p>Regarding those mentioned under the first heading, who
demand absolute, life-long sexual abstinence, it is hardly necessary
to say a word. It is nonsense, a pious superstition, a
Utopia contrary alike to nature and to civilization, born of the
belief in the &#8220;sinfulness&#8221; of sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>The normal sexual impulse is a <b>natural</b> phenomenon; it is
pure and thoroughly ethical; and it is only in an insane confusion
and in a morally reprehensible falsification of his own
nature that man has come to regard it as a &#8220;sin,&#8221; as an &#8220;evil.&#8221;
Man has a natural, inborn right to the gratification of the sexual
impulse. Absolute asceticism must be rejected as a thoroughly
<b>immoral</b> doctrine.</p>

<p>The same is true of the duplex sexual morality, alluded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page674">[674]</span>
under the third heading, by which that is justified to man which
is denied to woman. This &#8220;<b>morality</b>&#8221; (<i>lucus a non lucendo</i>)
presupposes for man a natural impulse, and demands for him
a right to gratify it, whilst the existence of such an impulse and
of such a right is denied to woman. We have shown that
this view is an inevitable consequence of coercive marriage
<span class="nowrap">morality.<a id="FNanchor688"></a><a href="#Footnote688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></span></p>

<p>The standpoint of the sceptics alluded to under &sect; 5 is
one which denies the possibility of <b>any</b> abstinence, even merely
temporary abstinence; but this view is equally to be rejected.
Man is a natural being; his sexual impulse is a natural instinct,
and as such one whose existence is justified; but at the same
time man is a <b>civilized being</b>. Civilization is an elevation, an
ennoblement, a transfiguration of nature, whose unduly powerful
impulses and powers must be tamed and harmonized by civilization.
The right to sexual gratification is therefore opposed by
the <b>duty</b> to set bounds to the sexual impulse, to conduct it into
such paths that no harm can result from its exercise, either to
the individual or to society; and in order that, like all other
impulses, it may subserve the purposes of the evolution of
civilization. To this end, however, a <b>relative abstinence</b> is of
great importance (this is a matter which has not hitherto been
sufficiently recognized); but this course it is only possible to
follow when, at the same time, we emphatically <b>affirm the rightness
of sexuality</b>, and when it is our desire to utilize it as a
<b>civilizing factor of the first rank</b>. The &#8220;individualization&#8221; of
the sexual impulse has been described in detail in an earlier
chapter of this work, to which I may refer the reader. If we
fail to recognize the value of <b>temporary abstinence</b>, and the importance
of the storing up of sexual energy which is thereby
effected, and the transformation of this energy into other energies
of a spiritual nature, such an individualization becomes impossible.</p>

<p>Alike the medical advocates (&sect; 2) and the moral advocates
(&sect; 4) of a relative temporary abstinence for both sexes
have, from their respective standpoints, made a just demand.
This is, in fact, in both cases an &#8220;ideal standpoint,&#8221; to use the
phrase of F. A. Lange; but it is also an ideal most desirable to
set before youth, and more especially before our German<span class="pagenum" id="Page675">[675]</span>
youth. We cannot repeat too often, or insist with too much
emphasis, what an endless blessing results from the endeavour
towards, and from the realization of, temporary sexual abstinence,
more especially in the years of <b>preparation</b> for life, but also in
the years of <b>independent creative work</b>.</p>

<p>The importance of <b>relative</b> sexual abstinence was first recognized
by the ancient Israelites. Numerous wise prescriptions
and utterances prove this. Julius Preuss, the most celebrated
student of ancient Jewish medicine, has recently, in an interesting
study of &#8220;Sexual Matters in the Bible and the Talmud&#8221;
(<i>Allgemeine Medizinische Central-Zeitung</i>, 1906, No. 30 <i>et seq.</i>),
collected the following facts bearing on the matter:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Chastity was a self-evident demand for the unmarried. It is true
that, in view of the early occurrence of puberty, they married very young&mdash;at
the age of eighteen or twenty; and Rabbi Huna is of opinion
that anyone who at the age of twenty is still unmarried passes his
days in sin or&mdash;which he regards as even worse&mdash;in sinful thoughts.
There are three whom God praises every day: an unmarried man who
lives in a large town and does not sin; a poor man who finds an object
of value and returns it to the owner, and a rich man who gives his
tithe secretly. Once when this doctrine was read out in the presence
of Rabbi Safra, who as a young man lived in a large town, his face
lighted up with joy. But Raba said to him: &#8216;It is not meant such
a one as thou art, but such a one as Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Oschaja,
who live in the street of the prostitutes, and make shoes for them, to
whom, therefore, the prostitutes come, and look upon them, but who,
notwithstanding this, do not raise their eyes to look upon the
prostitutes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>After marriage also they endeavoured by valuable prescriptions
to enforce the great civilizing idea of temporary sexual
abstinence. Thus, intercourse during menstruation was strictly
forbidden, and was regarded as a deadly sin; the same was the
case as regards intercourse when there was any other h&aelig;morrhage
from the genital organs; but in this case the abstinence
must last even longer. It is remarkable that the Catholic
theologians allowed sexual intercourse without limit when such
morbid h&aelig;morrhage was present, and allowed it also, with
certain restrictions, during menstruation. Further, among the
ancient Hebrews intercourse was forbidden during the week of
mourning for parents or brothers or sisters; it was forbidden
also during the festival of atonement. Guests in an inn when
travelling were also forbidden sexual intercourse, doubtless on
grounds of decency. Intercourse was likewise forbidden in
times of famine, in order to spare the bodily forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page676">[676]</span></p>

<p>Golden sayings recognize the value of moderation and of
relative abstinence.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>According to an ancient Israelitish popular saying, sexual intercourse
is one of eight things <b>which are beautiful when enjoyed in
strict moderation, but harmful when enjoyed very freely</b>. The others
are walking, possessions, work, wine, sleep, warm water (for bathing
and for drinking), and venesection.</p>

<p>Rabbi Jochanan said: &#8220;Man possesses a little limb: he who satisfies
it hungers; he who allows it to hunger is satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rabbi Ilai said: &#8220;When man observes that his evil impulse is more
powerful than he is himself, let him go to a place where people do not
know him, let him put on dark clothes, let him wear a dark turban,
and let him do that which his heart desires; but let him not publicly
profane the name of God.&#8221; This can only mean that in general he
only controls the desire who has already tasted the fruit&mdash;that is to
say, that abstinence is the safest means against lust; but he who,
notwithstanding this, finds that the impulse threatens to become too
violent, still has the duty to fight against it, and in any case not to
yield immediately.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>This ancient notion of relative asceticism was, unfortunately,
falsified and thrust into the background by the Utopian and
contra-natural idea of absolute asceticism; its great value was
completely obscured by the inevitable reaction against the
principle of absolute chastity. This reaction led actually to
the formation of rules regarding the frequency of intercourse,
such as that attributed to Luther&mdash;&#8220;Twice a week does harm
neither to her nor to me&#8221;; <b>although it is precisely in this department
of life that no rules can be given, and that the greatest
individual variations occur</b>, so that &#8220;twice a week&#8221; may for
many constitute by far too much, and can only be regarded as
permissible to robust constitutions. <b>Daily</b> indulgence in sexual
intercourse, continued for a <b>long period</b> of time, would be deleterious
even to a Hercules, <b>and in all circumstances would be
harmful to both parties</b>. Nature herself, by exhibiting a certain
periodicity in sexual excitement (which periodicity is admittedly
far more distinct in women than it is in men, who can &#8220;always&#8221;
love), has facilitated temporary abstinence. This is, in fact, a
natural demand even of the most extreme ethical materialism;
for, as Friedrich Albert <span class="nowrap">Lange<a id="FNanchor689"></a><a href="#Footnote689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></span>
rightly points out, &#8220;even though
the individual sensual pleasure, as with Aristippos or Lamettrie,
is raised to a principle, <b>self-control</b> still remains a requirement
of philosophy, if only in order to assure the permanence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page677">[677]</span>
capacity for enjoyment.&#8221; So also the poet of the &#8220;New Tanh&auml;user&#8221;
sings:</p>

<p>The question of abstinence is an entirely different one, according
as it relates to the time <b>before</b> or <b>after</b> the first experience of
sexual intercourse. Experience shows that in the former case
abstinence is far easier than it is when the forbidden fruit
has once been tasted. If, with the author of this book, relative
asceticism is regarded as the most desirable ideal, we shall
endeavour in <b>youth</b> to realize that ideal for as long a time as
possible, <b>without</b> any interruption by sexual intercourse; whereas
in the later period of the fully-developed sexual life we shall
practise sexual abstinence only from time to time.</p>

<p>With regard to the former point, it would be the greatest
good fortune for every man if he could remain sexually abstinent
until the complete maturity of body and mind&mdash;that is, until
the age of <span class="nowrap">twenty-five.<a id="FNanchor690"></a><a href="#Footnote690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></span>
But this is in most cases an impossibility.
Yet it <b>is possible</b> for <b>every</b> healthy man&mdash;and it is an
imperative demand of individual and social hygiene&mdash;<b>to abstain
completely from sexual intercourse at least until the age of twenty</b>.
That is possible without any harm resulting, and it is carried out
by innumerable persons of both sexes. It is, indeed, a fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page678">[678]</span>
in civilized countries the physical and mental maturity of girls
and boys by no means coincides with their sexual maturity,
but, on the contrary, occurs from three to five years later. First
between the ages of twenty and twenty-two does man attain
complete <span class="nowrap">development.<a id="FNanchor691"></a><a href="#Footnote691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></span>
If the sexual impulse is not artificially
awakened and stimulated during these years of adolescence, it
may remain very moderate, without masturbation and without
pollutions, and can be easily controlled. Relations with the
other sex have not yet become necessary for the development of
the individual personality. The human being has still enough to
do in isolation. First with the commencement of the third decade
of life do the conditions alter, and sexual tension becomes so
great as to demand the adequate and natural discharge given by
the normal sexual act. If this is impossible, pollutions form the
natural, or masturbation forms the unnatural, outlet; and when
abstinence is continued for a long time after attaining this age,
the vital freshness and the spiritual and emotional condition are
more or less impaired. To have emphasized this fact, in opposition
to those <span class="nowrap">authors<a id="FNanchor692"></a><a href="#Footnote692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></span>
who declared that total sexual abstinence
is absolutely harmless to mature men, was the great service of
Wilhelm <span class="nowrap">Erb,<a id="FNanchor693"></a><a href="#Footnote693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></span>
the celebrated, widely experienced Heidelberg
neurologist.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is a well-known fact,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;that healthy young men
with a powerful sexual impulse suffer not a little from abstinence,
that from time to time they are &#8216;as if possessed&#8217; by the impulse,
that erotic ideas press in upon them from all sides, disturb their work
and their nocturnal repose, and imperiously demand relief. I always
remember the remark of a friend of my youth, a young artist, who,
when speaking of these things, was accustomed to say with intense
meaning: &#8216;Wer nie die kummervollen N&auml;chte in seinem Bette
weinend sass....&#8217; And the same man could not sufficiently extol
the relaxing, disburdening, and positively refreshing influence of an
occasional gratification; and the same thing has been said to me
innumerable times by earnest and thoroughly moderate men.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Women also gave him similar
<span class="nowrap">assurances.<a id="FNanchor694"></a><a href="#Footnote694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></span> In numerous
cases Erb observed physical and mental harm to result from<span class="pagenum" id="Page679">[679]</span>
abstinence&mdash;sometimes in healthy individuals, but more especially
in the neuropathic.</p>

<p>Important also are the investigations of L.
<span class="nowrap">L&ouml;wenfeld<a id="FNanchor695"></a><a href="#Footnote695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></span> regarding
the influence of abstinence. He found that in men under the
age of twenty-four any troubles worth mentioning as a result of
sexual abstinence were comparatively rare, as compared with
the case of men between the ages of twenty-four and thirty-six
years, the years of complete manly power and sexual capacity;
and he found that whereas in healthy persons these disturbances
were indeed of a trifling character (general excitability, sexual
hyper&aelig;sthesia, hypochondriacal ideas, disinclination for work,
slight attacks of giddiness), in neuropathic persons, on the
contrary, there would occur coercive ideas, melancholy, feelings
of anxiety, and even hallucinations. Females, according to
L&ouml;wenfeld, bear abstinence&mdash;even absolute abstinence&mdash;much
better than men, but in them also hysterical and neurasthenic
conditions may develop as a result of sexual abstinence.</p>

<p>All these harmful consequences of abstinence are, however,
neither in man nor in woman, of such a nature that, where an
opportunity for sexual intercourse at once hygienic and free from
ethical objections is wanting, the gratification of the sexual
impulse need be advised by the physician as a &#8220;therapeutic
measure.&#8221; No; Erb himself insists that, on the contrary, the
dangers threatened by venereal diseases <b>altogether outweigh</b> the
comparatively rare and trifling injuries to health resulting
from abstinence. &#8220;Extra-conjugal&#8221; sexual intercourse
involves the dangers of syphilitic or gonorrh&#339;al infection, or of
illegitimate pregnancy, which latter to-day must, unfortunately,
be regarded as a kind of severe disease. In contrast with these
evils, any harmful consequences of abstinence fade away to
nothing.</p>

<p>Later in life, when the possibility of a permanent pure love
exists, the value of temporary abstinence is to be found especially
in the spiritual sphere. Precisely for the &#8220;erotocrat,&#8221; as Georg
Hirth terms one endowed with a powerful and healthy sexual
impulse, is this temporary abstinence of a certain importance,
because the stored-up quantum of sexual tension re-enforces the
inward spiritual productivity. A number of men, at once endowed
with strong sexual needs and with a noble mental capacity, have
assured me that, in consequence of abstinence, they have temporarily
experienced a peculiar deepening and concentration of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page680">[680]</span>
mental capacity, by means of which they were undeniably
enabled to increase their mental output. This point in the
hygiene of intellectual activity, which seems not to have been
unknown to Goethe, has been as yet too little studied.</p>

<p>In any case, it is definitely established that from the standpoint
of civilization the idea of sexual abstinence is justified, if for this
reason alone: because in it we find a great means for increasing
and strengthening of the <b>will</b>; but, in the second place, because
in it we have a valuable protection against the dangers of wild
love; and, finally, because sexual abstinence emphasizes the fact
that life contains other things worth striving for besides matters
of sex, that the content of life is far from being exhausted by the
sexual, even though the sexual impulse, in addition to the impulse
of self-preservation, will always remain the most powerful of all
vital activities.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p class="noindent">The manner in which up to the present day humanity has,
properly speaking, completely ignored the fact of sexuality is
at once remarkable and difficult to understand. Until recently
people went so far as to regard scientific research into sexual
matters by <b>adult persons</b> as improper! The mystical idea of the
sinfulness, of the radically evil character, of the sexual, was a
dogma which even natural science appeared to admit. Our
attitude towards the sexual was as if it were at once Sphinx
and Gorgon&#8217;s head, as if it were the veiled statue of Sais. We
stood helpless, in the face of this mysterious and malignant power,
against the <b>blind hazard of chance which plays</b> so momentous
a part, more especially in sexual affairs. As everywhere in life,
so here also, the dominion of chance could be overcome only by
means of knowledge. The solution of the sexual problem
demands, in the first place, <b>openness</b>, <b>clearness</b>, <b>learning</b> in the
department of the sexual, knowledge of cause and effect, and
the <b>transmission</b> of this knowledge to the <b>next generation</b>,
so that this latter may without harm become wise. <b>Sexual
education</b> is an important chapter in general
<span class="nowrap">pedagogy.<a id="FNanchor696"></a><a href="#Footnote696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></span></p>

<p>Regarding animals, plants, and stones the youthful human
being of to-day acquires the most exact information, but we
have hitherto <b>refused</b> him the right to understand his own body,
and to acquire a knowledge of certain important vital functions
of that body. There can be no doubt about the fact that the
modern human being, who has learned to so large an extent to
regard himself as a <b>social</b> being, has a sacred natural right to this
knowledge.</p>

<p>Celebrated pedagogues of a hundred years ago, such as Rousseau,
Salzmann, Basedow, Jean Paul, etc., expressed themselves
in favour of the early sexual enlightenment of youth, and gave
the most valuable advice regarding the methods to be
<span class="nowrap">employed;<a id="FNanchor697"></a><a href="#Footnote697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></span>
but their views remained for the most part devoid of practical
effect, and it is only in recent years, in connexion with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page684">[684]</span>
question of the protection of motherhood, with the campaign
against prostitution, and with the attempt to suppress venereal
diseases, that interest in this matter has been reawakened; and
there now exists in this department an extensive literature,
belonging chiefly to the last few years, proceeding from the pens
of physicians, pedagogues, hygienists, and advocates of woman&#8217;s
<span class="nowrap">rights.<a id="FNanchor698"></a><a href="#Footnote698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></span>
It is, in truth, the burning question of our time, the
solution of which is here attempted. Correct sexual education
forms the foundation for the ennoblement and resanation of our
entire sexual life. Only <b>knowledge</b> and <b>will</b> can here effect a
cure. Thus, sexual pedagogy naturally falls into two parts&mdash;<b>sexual
enlightenment</b> and the <b>education of the will</b>.</p>

<p>The need for sexual enlightenment is now recognized by all
far-seeing social hygienists and pedagogues. The only difference
of opinion concerns the <b>when</b> and the <b>how</b>. Some plead for
enlightenment as early as possible, in the first years of school
life; others wish to defer enlightenment until puberty, or
even later. I am of opinion that the circumstances in this
respect are entirely different, according as we have to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page685">[685]</span>
small towns and the open country, where more careful watching
of children is possible, and where the dangers of premature
sexual development and of seduction are not so great, or as we
have to do with large towns, where, in my view, the children
<b>cannot be enlightened too early</b>, since town life brings the
children of all classes, and social misery brings more especially
the children of the lowest classes of the population, so early into
contact with sexual matters that a purposive enlightenment
becomes absolutely indispensable. Children living in large towns
should, from ten years onwards, be gradually and carefully made
acquainted with the principal facts of the sexual life. We find
here <b>more points of association</b> than is usually imagined. Gutzkow,
in his admirable autobiography, &#8220;From the Days of My
Boyhood&#8221; (Frankfort-a.-M., 1852, pp. 263, 264), has beautifully
described this:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The first appearances of love in the heart of the child occur as
secretly as the fall of the dew upon flowers. Playing and jesting,
innocence gropes its way through the darkness. Words, perceptions,
ideas, which to the adult appear to be full of dangerous barbs, the
child grasps with careless security, and takes the duplex sexual life
of humanity to be a primeval fact which came into the world with
man as a matter of course, and one which requires no explanation.
Born from the mother&#8217;s womb, to the child the mother is the secure
bridge by which it is conducted past all the riddles of womanhood.
The child imitates the love of the father for the mother, plays the
game of the family, plays father and mother, plays at being himself,
a child. From the rustling autumn leaves, from abandoned bundles
of straw, huts and nests are built, and for half an hour at a time a
completely blameless boy can lie down besides his girl playmate,
quietly, and as if magnetized by the intimation of love. Danger is
in truth not far distant from such a practice of childish na&iuml;vet&eacute;; it
lurks in the background, and seeks only an opportunity to lead astray.
But a child never understands the significance of the severe punishment
which it so often receives for its imitative imaginary family
life. The amatory life of the adult first breaks upon the imagination
of the child and upon his quiet play like the opening of a door into
a house. People take so little care of what they do before the
innocent; they exhibit passionate affection for one another; they
caress when the children are by. The child sees, ponders, and listens.
Certain hieroglyphics alarm it; tales are laughed at&mdash;tales which
suddenly throw a strange and wonderful light upon quite familiar
human beings. The boy will notice that his elder sister has a joy or
a sorrow, the nature of which he cannot completely grasp. He sees
an elder brother filled with the joy of life, with the lust of youth,
with the love of adventure, and no attempt is made to conceal these
passions from the child.... Such and similar experiences succeed
one another without cessation, and tales which the child hears are<span class="pagenum" id="Page686">[686]</span>
listened to with eagerness. The red threads of love and of the charm
of beautiful women are not to be grasped by the hand of a child,
and yet they have upon the child a certain secret influence.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The child hears and sees much that is erotic, even immoral,
but does not stop to think about it, does not understand it.
After a while its ignorance becomes a puzzle; soon lascivious
thoughts arise. Maria Lischnewska describes very vividly this
psychological process in the soul of the child, in part according
to her observations as a teacher. She justly criticizes the
&#8220;stork stories,&#8221; to which the child listens without believing
them, in order subsequently to be enlightened in an extremely
disagreeable manner by older ill-conditioned
<span class="nowrap">comrades.<a id="FNanchor699"></a><a href="#Footnote699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></span></p>

<p>These children, ten or twelve years of age, often learn about
sexual matters from the lowest side, <b>without</b> obtaining a <b>true
knowledge</b>. They frequently acquire the most astounding verbal
treasury of lewd expressions, and even sing obscene songs, of
which Maria Lischnewska gives a remarkable example on the
part of a girl twelve years of age.</p>

<p>No, there can be no question that the child at school, from
the tenth year onwards, should, without fear of disastrous consequences,
be enlightened regarding sexual matters by parents
and teachers, in order to avoid the dangers which we have just
described. But this instruction must be divested of any individual
relationship, of any personal character, and must be
communicated in thoroughly general terms, as <b>natural scientific
knowledge</b>, as a medical doctrine, belonging to the province of
philosophical and pathological science. In this way will be
avoided any undesirable accessory effect related to subjective
perceptions. When Matthisson esteems youth as happy on this
account, because the <b>book of possibilities</b> is not yet open to its
gaze, this certainly does <b>not</b> hold as regards sexual enlightenment.
Here, to a certain degree, this book of possibilities must
be disclosed, if we do not wish all the poetry and all the ideal
view of life to be utterly destroyed by contact with rude reality.
Precisely in this case do we understand the wonderful remark of
Goethe, that we receive the veil of poetry from the hand of
<b>truth</b>. This first renders possible a truly earnest and profound
conception of sexual relationships; this creates a consciousness
of responsibility which cannot be awakened sufficiently early.<span class="pagenum" id="Page687">[687]</span>
The true danger is, as <span class="nowrap">Freud<a id="FNanchor700"></a><a href="#Footnote700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></span>
also points out, the intermixture
of &#8220;lasciviousness and prudery&#8221; with which humanity is
accustomed to regard the sexual problem, just because
people have not learned sufficiently to understand the connexion
between cause and effect in this department of human
activity.</p>

<p>Various methods have been recommended for sexual enlightenment.
I shall discuss more particularly the suggestions of the
Austrian <i>Realschul</i> professor, Sigmund, of the <i>Volkschul</i> teacher,
Maria Lischnewska, and of the University professor, F. W.
F&ouml;rster.</p>

<p>Sigmund (quoted by Ullmann, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 7) considers that in
the <i>Volksch&uuml;ler</i> (primary schools), in the case of children up to
the age of eleven years, there should be no systematic explanation
of sexual matters, and that this should be begun first in the
Gymnasium (higher school). His scheme of instruction is as
follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>1. The enlightenment of the pupils at the Gymnasium is to be
effected in five stages (Classes I., II., V., VI., VII.)</p>

<p>2. The enlightenment in the lower classes is limited to the processes
of sexual reproduction. In the first class, the origin and birth of the
mammalian young and the origin of insects&#8217; eggs are explained. In
the second class, the origin and birth of reptiles&#8217; and birds&#8217; eggs,
the fertilization of the eggs of fishes and batrachians, the ova
of the sea-urchin, and those of the jellyfish, are described. <b>The act
of sexual intercourse will not be alluded to in the first two classes&mdash;that
is, it will not be mentioned to children before the age of thirteen
years.</b></p>

<p>3. The completion of the idea of &#8220;sexual life&#8221; is effected by means
of botanical and zoological instruction in the upper school in a synthetic
manner, wherein no important detail is omitted, but the copulatory
act is kept in the background.</p>

<p>4. All sexual matters expressly concerning human beings, and all
the pathological relations of the sexual life, should be left to the
hygienic instruction, which is given during one hour weekly to the
seventh class as a part of general instruction in somatology.</p>

<p>5. The natural history taught to the sixth class will embrace
zoology only; the natural system will be considered in an ascending
series (excluding human somatology, which in a logical manner is
deferred until the study of zoology is completed, and it will thus be
dealt with in the seventh class, as a preparation to the instruction
in hygiene).</p>

<p>6. In conferences with parents, the parents can be kept informed
regarding the nature of the instruction which is being given to their
children, and can at the same time be led to work in unison with the
school in this matter.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page688">[688]</span></p>

<p>Maria Lischnewska advises beginning already in the third
class of primary schools&mdash;that is, when the child is only eight
years old&mdash;to give instruction in the elements of natural science,
more especially utilizing, as the first means of sexual enlightenment,
the examples of vegetable fertilization, as well as the
reproduction of fishes and birds. Even to the question &#8220;Whence
do little children come?&#8221; an answer should be given, more or
less in the following terms:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The child lies in the body of the mother: when she breathes, then
the child breathes; when she eats and drinks, the child also obtains
his food. It lies there warm and safe. Gradually it becomes larger
and begins to move. It has to lie somewhat curled up, because there
is so little room for it. But the mother feels that it is alive; she is
full of joy, and makes ready the child&#8217;s clothing and its bed. Finally
it is fully grown. The mother&#8217;s body opens, and the child comes to
the light. Then the mother takes it into her arms with joy and
nourishes it with her milk.&#8221; Then the teacher would pause, and
continue after a while: &#8220;Now, would you like to see the child?&#8221;
Then there would naturally be a many-voiced &#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; and the
teacher would show to the class a picture such as our anatomical
atlases exhibit now in beautiful form. The abdominal walls of the
mother are turned back, and the child is seen slumbering. Then the
teacher would say: &#8220;Thus you also slept within the body of your
mother. You belong to her as to no other human being in the
whole world. For this reason you should always love and honour
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus is the child&#8217;s urgent demand for knowledge satisfied. He
is freed from all prying into nooks and corners. He experiences
a feeling of honourable respect towards the primary source of
life.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In the fourth school year further examples of the reproduction
of plants, fishes, and birds should be given; in the fifth and sixth
years the first demonstration of the process of sexual union
among the mammals, with some account of embryology; and
the process of birth should also be described. Then there should
follow (at about the age of thirteen or fourteen) enlightenment
regarding the development of the sexual life and regarding
venereal diseases&mdash;information, that is to say, concerning hygiene
and concerning the protection of one&#8217;s own body. Physicians
such as Oker Blom and Dr. Agnes Hacker definitely demand
that elucidation regarding this latter point should <b>not</b> be deferred
until the time of puberty.</p>

<p>F. W. F&ouml;rster proposes to postpone the whole process of
enlightenment <b>until the twelfth or thirteenth year</b>; and if at an
earlier age a child expresses any natural doubt regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page689">[689]</span>
stork fables, the following answer should be given (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 606):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Where small children come from is a matter which you cannot
yet understand. We grown-up persons even understand very little
about it. I promise you that I will explain to you what we know
of the matter on your twelfth birthday, but only if you promise me
something in return. Do you know that there are boys and girls so
bumptious that they behave as if they already knew all about it, because
they have somewhere picked up a word or two without really understanding
it? Promise me that you will never listen when such as
these begin to talk about the matter; for you may be certain that the
true secrets are matters of which they are ignorant, for this reason&mdash;they
would not speak about it. He who really knows holds it as a
sacred matter; he is silent about it, and does not call it out at the
street comers.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>F&ouml;rster strongly advises <b>against</b> associating sexual enlightenment
with a knowledge of the reproductive process in plants and
animals, for this reason: that if this is done &#8220;the human being
is brought too near to the vegetable and animal life,&#8221; and the
&#8220;sacred thought&#8221; of the elevation of humanity above the animal
is obscured. He then gives very beautiful examples and modes
of instruction for such sexual enlightenment of children twelve
years of age.</p>

<p>I myself am of opinion that, without in any way making light of
the difference between man and animal, the earlier elucidation
at about the age of ten years should be associated with the general
instruction in natural history regarding the reproductive process
of animals and plants; and then very gradually, up to the age
of fourteen, all important points in this department can be
explained, including, finally, an account of the venereal diseases.
It is obvious that after this time, more especially in the
dangerous years of puberty, systematic enlightenment must be
continued. That which is good and useful in this department
of knowledge cannot be too often repeated.</p>

<p>But all enlightenment will be useless unless hand in hand with
it there proceeds <b>a process of education of the character and the
will</b>. Our school youth thinks and dreams too much, and does
too little. Up to the present time it has been believed that it is
sufficient to teach children, and to continue to teach them, to
care for their health, to see that they have good food and sound
sleep, without also taking into consideration the necessity for
awakening the <b>individuality</b> and the <b>energy</b> slumbering in each
one of them. The &#8220;gymnasium&#8221; must concern itself with the
<b>gymnastics</b>, not only of the body, but also of the mind, and must<span class="pagenum" id="Page690">[690]</span>
thus restore that harmony between body and mind which appears
to have been quite lost at the present day. Bodily education by
games and sports is only one of the means for this purpose. The
principal aim is to strengthen the character, to induce the habit
of self-command and self-denial by a profound and intimate
grasp of sexual problems. Nowhere does fantastic dreaming
take revenge more thoroughly than in sexual relationships, for
which reason also the so-called &#8220;only children&#8221; are especially
<span class="nowrap">endangered;<a id="FNanchor701"></a><a href="#Footnote701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></span>
nowhere do clear knowledge, objective acquirements,
and a firm will celebrate finer triumphs over blind impulses
than they do here. The principal rule of sexual pedagogy runs
as follows: Avoid the <b>first opportunity</b> and the <b>first contact</b>;
keep the child and the young man and the young woman at a
distance from all the stimulating pleasures and enjoyments of
the adult. The production of manliness, as it has recently been
described by <span class="nowrap">Mosso,<a id="FNanchor702"></a><a href="#Footnote702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></span>
G&uuml;ssfeldt,<a id="FNanchor703"></a><a href="#Footnote703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Georg
<span class="nowrap">Sticker,<a id="FNanchor704"></a><a href="#Footnote704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></span> and Ludwig
<span class="nowrap">Gurlitt,<a id="FNanchor705"></a><a href="#Footnote705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></span>
has the greatest importance, more especially as regards
the sexual life. This has been insisted on, above all, by Hans
<span class="nowrap">Wegener<a id="FNanchor706"></a><a href="#Footnote706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></span>
and F. W. F&ouml;rster (<i>op. cit.</i>). Moral statistics have
incontrovertibly proved that progress in civilization and morals
does not depend upon punishment or upon prophylactic measures
against errors and excesses of passion, but only upon the <b>subjective</b>
improvement and strengthening of the single individual.
Guizot declared: &#8220;C&#8217;est de l&#8217;&eacute;tat <i>int&eacute;rieur</i> de l&#8217;homme que d&eacute;pend
l&#8217;&eacute;tat visible de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.&#8221;
<span class="nowrap">Drobisch,<a id="FNanchor707"></a><a href="#Footnote707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></span>
in his &#8220;Moral Statistics,&#8221;
has established this fact yet more firmly. Energy is the
magic word for all vital activities of the present day, both spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page691">[691]</span>
and physical. Discipline, work, abstinence, bodily hygiene, are
the means for educating the character, and these also play the
principal part in sexual <span class="nowrap">pedagogy.<a id="FNanchor708"></a><a href="#Footnote708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></span></p>

For this reason, Fr. W. F&ouml;rster, in his admirable &#8220;Jugendlehre&#8221; (Berlin,

R. Penzig (pp. 215-222), and Adele Schreiber (pp. 223-231). Important in
relation to sexual enlightenment is also the question (one actively discussed at
the present moment) of the <b>education of the sexes in common</b>&mdash;the so-called
<b>co-education</b>. It has been proved by experience that co-education has a
good effect in sexual relationships (<i>cf.</i> Gertrud B&auml;umer, &#8220;Co-education,&#8221; <i>op. cit.</i>,
vol. ii., pp. 44-48).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote708"></a><a href="#FNanchor708"><span class="label">[708]</span></a>
The question of sexual education and enlightenment occupies at the moment
a place in the foreground of public interest, and rightly so; for upon this depends
principally the further reform and the resanation of all the sexual relationships
of civilized peoples. For this reason the Discussions, now in the press, of the
Third Congress of the Society for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases (&#8220;Sexualp&auml;dagogik&#8221;),
Leipzig, 1907, were occupied exclusively with this subject, which
was considered in elaborate debates from four points of view:</p>

<div class="centerblock">

<ul class="viewpoints">

<li>1. Sexual instruction in the house and the school.</li>
<li>2. Sexual enlightenment of young persons at puberty.</li>
<li>3. Sexual instruction of teachers and parents.</li>
<li>4. Sexual dietetics and education.</li>

</ul>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p>The present position of sexual pedagogy in all these respects is exactly defined
in this comprehensive volume; and, in addition, at the conclusion of the book we
find a compend of the recent literature of the subject. Much of value regarding
sexual regimen is to be found in the work of H. Mann, &#8220;Art and the Sexual
Conduct of Life&#8221; (Oranienburg, 1907), and in that of A. Eulenburg, &#8220;Sexual
Regimen,&#8221; published in <i>Mutterschutz</i>, July and August, 1907. As an opponent
of early sexual enlightenment, we must mention G. Leubuscher (&#8220;School Medicine
and School Hygiene,&#8221; pp. 65-70; Leipzig, 1907). He considers that such
enlightenment should only be given at the time of leaving school. His reasons,
however, are not convincing, and, above all, do not apply to large towns.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p class="noindent">Whereas in former times opinions on social questions were
determined principally by <b>economic</b> considerations, to-day we
are to a great extent influenced also by the aims and endeavours
of individual and social <b>hygiene</b>; for this reason the so-called
<b>problem of population</b> has come to occupy the consciousness of
civilized mankind to a far greater extent than before it has
passed from the stage of theory into that of practice. Serious
critical political economists, such as, for example, B. G.
<span class="nowrap">Schmoller,<a id="FNanchor709"></a><a href="#Footnote709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></span>
have recognized this. The increasing understanding
of the conditions of social life, knowledge of the connexion between
economic conditions and the number and quality of the population,
must of itself lead to the discussion of the question whether
the regulation of the number of children born is not one of the
principal duties of modern civilization. The Englishman Robert
Malthus was the first who, stimulated by an idea of Benjamin
Franklin, in the year 1798, in his &#8220;Essay on the Principles of
Population,&#8221; discussed this serious, and even alarming, question
of the natural <b>consequences</b> of unrestricted sexual intercourse,
and answered it in an extremely pessimistic sense. For, according
to him, whereas human beings tend to increase in number
according to a geometrical progression&mdash;that is, in the ratio
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on&mdash;the means of subsistence increase only
in arithmetical progression&mdash;that is, in the ratio of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and so on. Hence it follows that the numbers of the population
can be kept within bounds, so as to remain proportional to the
nutritive possibilities, only by means of decimating influences,
such as vice, poverty, disease, the entire &#8220;struggle for existence,&#8221;
by preventive measures, and by the so-called &#8220;moral restraint&#8221;
in and before marriage. Although this celebrated theory, which
filled with alarm, not only all those already living in Europe,
but also all those who wished to <b>produce</b> new life, has to-day been
generally recognized as <span class="nowrap">false,<a id="FNanchor710"></a><a href="#Footnote710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></span>
since it failed to take into account<span class="pagenum" id="Page696">[696]</span>
technical advances in the preparation of the
<span class="nowrap">soil<a id="FNanchor711"></a><a href="#Footnote711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></span> and other ways
in which it will become possible to increase the means of subsistence;
and he equally ignored the possibility of a better division
of property. None the less does his theory remain apposite in
respect of many of the social relationships of more recent times;
the doctrine has, in fact, temporary validity for certain periods
of civilization, such as our own. Malthus recommended, as the
principal means of preventing over-population, <b>abstinence</b> from
sexual intercourse (moral restraint) before marriage, and the
<b>postponement</b> of marriage; thus he was an apostle of the &#8220;relative
asceticism&#8221; recommended in the twenty-fifth chapter of the
present work.</p>

<p>In England this early view found utterance among the political
economists and sociologists, such as Chalmers, Ricardo, John
Stuart Mill, Say, Thornton, etc. It was also actively discussed in
wide circles of the population, so that as early as the year 1825 the
&#8220;disciples of Malthus&#8221; were a typical phenomenon of English life.</p>

<p>A further development of malthusianism in the practical
direction was represented by the so-called &#8220;neo-malthusianism&#8221;&mdash;that
is, an actual diffusion of instruction in the means for the prevention
of pregnancy and for the limitation of the number of
children. Such a procedure was first publicly recommended by
Francis Place, in the year 1822; but no widespread teaching of
practical malthusianism occurred till a considerably later date,
notably after the foundation of the Malthusian League, on July 17,
1877. The principal advocates of neo-malthusianism in England
were John Stuart Mill, Charles Drysdale, Charles Bradlaugh, and
Mrs. Besant.</p>

<p>Malthusian practice is, however, much older than the theory.
<span class="nowrap">Metchnikoff<a id="FNanchor712"></a><a href="#Footnote712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></span>
declares the endeavour to diminish the number of
children to be a very widely diffused &#8220;disharmony of the family
instinct,&#8221; which in itself is much more recent, and is much less
widely diffused in the animal kingdom than the sexual instinct.
Animals, at any rate, know nothing of the prevention of conception;
that is a &#8220;privilege&#8221; of the human species. By primitive
races such preventive measures are very widely employed. Among
these measures one of the best known is the &#8220;mica&#8221; operation
of the Australian natives&mdash;the slitting up of the urethra of the
male along the lower surface of the penis, so that the semen<span class="pagenum" id="Page697">[697]</span>
flows out just in front of the scrotum, and is ejaculated outside
the <span class="nowrap">vagina.<a id="FNanchor713"></a><a href="#Footnote713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></span>
Regarding the wide diffusion of artificial abortion
among savage races, Ploss-Bartels gives detailed reports. The
pursuit of material enjoyments, characteristic of civilized peoples,
is not here (as recent authors have erroneously assumed) the determining
influence; we have, in fact, to do with a widely diffused
disharmony of the family <span class="nowrap">instinct,<a id="FNanchor714"></a><a href="#Footnote714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></span>
for which in certain <b>definite</b>
conditions some justification must be admitted. The period
for the unconditional rejection of malthusianism by pietists and
absolute moralists has passed away definitely. Not only physicians,
but also professional political economists, recognize the
relative justification and admissibility of the use of preventive
measures in certain circumstances for the limitation of the
procreation of children. It has rightly been pointed
<span class="nowrap">out<a id="FNanchor715"></a><a href="#Footnote715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></span> that
in <b>every</b> marriage a time must eventually arrive when preventive
measures in sexual intercourse are employed, and necessarily must
be employed, because, in respect of the state of health of the wife,
and also in view of economic conditions, their use is urgently
demanded. These relationships have been discussed with great
insight by A. <span class="nowrap">Hegar,<a id="FNanchor716"></a><a href="#Footnote716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></span>
and he has proved the justification of
practical neo-malthusianism in every ordinary marriage, as well
as for the population at large. By means of a &#8220;regulation of
reproduction,&#8221; an immoderate increase of the population is prevented;
by diminishing the quantity we improve the quality
of the offspring. Late marriages, long pauses between the
separate deliveries, and the greatest possible sexual abstinence,
subserve this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page698">[698]</span></p>

<p>Like Hegar, the Munich hygienist Max
<span class="nowrap">Gruber<a id="FNanchor717"></a><a href="#Footnote717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></span> also recognizes
the necessity for setting bounds to the number of children to be
brought into the world, since the capacity of the human species
to increase is far greater than its power to increase the means of
subsistence. He describes very vividly the physical and moral
misery of the parents and the children when the latter are too
numerous; he also shows that from the birth of the fourth child
onwards the inborn force and health of the children diminish
more and more. Naturally, also, diseases affecting the parents,
and the pressing danger of the inheritance of these diseases,
renders necessary the use of sexual preventive measures, or
else of moral restraint. Gruber enunciates the thoroughly neo-malthusian
proposition:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;The procreation of children must be kept within bounds, if mankind
wishes to free itself from the cruel condition by which, in irrational
nature, the balance is maintained&mdash;death in the mass side by side
with procreation in the mass!&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>L. <span class="nowrap">L&ouml;wenfeld<a id="FNanchor718"></a><a href="#Footnote718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></span>
also sees in the recommendation of such measures
for the prevention of pregnancy &#8220;nothing either improper or
immoral&#8221;; he sees in these measures &#8220;means for diminishing
the poverty of the lower classes, and for abolishing, to a great
extent, the high infantile mortality of these classes, although
neo-malthusianism is in no way a panacea for all the social evils
of our time&#8221;; and he writes very strongly against the condemnation
of preventive measures by a &#8220;perverse medical zealotry&#8221;;
in fact, he assigns to preventive measures an immense hygienic
importance. Many other physicians also, such as
<span class="nowrap">Mensinga<a id="FNanchor719"></a><a href="#Footnote719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></span>
(the discoverer of the occlusive pessary, the first medical man
in Germany to assert with energy the justification of employing
means for the prevention of pregnancy, and the first to establish
with precision the indications for the use of these measures,
especially in relation to the disadvantageous consequences to
women&#8217;s health of bearing a large number of children),
<span class="nowrap">F&uuml;rbringer,<a id="FNanchor720"></a><a href="#Footnote720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></span>
Spener,<a id="FNanchor721"></a><a href="#Footnote721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
and others, have drawn attention to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page699">[699]</span>
eminent hygienic and social importance of measures for the prevention
of pregnancy; whereas, on the other hand, in France, in
view of the alarming decline in the population of that country,
scientific medicine has adopted a more hostile attitude; no
longer, however, so bitterly hostile as in the work (now somewhat
out of date, but nevertheless containing interesting details)
of <span class="nowrap">Bergeret.<a id="FNanchor722"></a><a href="#Footnote722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></span>
A layman also, Hans Ferdy (A.
<span class="nowrap">Meyerhof),<a id="FNanchor723"></a><a href="#Footnote723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></span> has
published a number of interesting works on practical neo-malthusianism.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to give a brief account of the means
commonly employed for the prevention of pregnancy.</p>

<p>l. <b>The Restriction of Intercourse to Particular Periods.</b>&mdash;It is
clear that by means of relative asceticism, and by restriction of
the number of individual acts of sexual intercourse, the possibilities
of fertilization can be limited to a considerable extent.
Thus, Capellmann, in a work published in 1883, entitled &#8220;Facultative
Sterility, without Offence to Moral Laws,&#8221; recommended
abstinence from intercourse for fourteen days <b>after</b> the cessation
of menstruation and for three or four days <b>before</b> the commencement
of the flow, in the belief that fertilization occurs principally
during the days immediately before and after menstruation.
Capellmann thus revived the prescription of Soranos, a gynecologist
of the days of antiquity. According to the researches of the
physiologist Victor Hensen, it is true that the greatest number
of fertilizations take place during the <b>first</b> few days after the
menstrual period; but conception <b>may</b> also occur on any other
day of the menstrual cycle, although the probability of conception
at other periods than those named is a diminishing one. Feskstitow
has based upon statistical data an interesting &#8220;conception
curve,&#8221; according to which the frequency of fertilization on the
last day of menstruation, on the first, ninth, eleventh, and twenty-third
days after the end of the flow, varies respectively according
to the ratios 48, 62, 13, 9, 1; between these points the course
of the curve is almost straight. On the twenty-third day after
menstruation the probability of conception is thus one-sixty-second
of the maximum. Thus, though the probability of fertilization
following intercourse on the twenty-third day after the
cessation of the flow is much <b>less</b> than the probability of fertilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page700">[700]</span>
as a result of intercourse shortly after menstruation, still, the
possibility of conception in the former case cannot be absolutely
excluded.</p>

<p>It has also been recommended that in certain <b>seasons of the
year</b>, to which a peculiar influence upon fertility has been ascribed,
more especially the months of May and June, abstinence from
intercourse should be observed. But this is naturally <b>quite
untrustworthy</b>, since the same mother can conceive in all months
of the year, as is sufficiently proved by the ordinary variations
in the birthdays of children.</p>

<p>Somewhat more trustworthy, but still <b>not</b> absolutely to be
depended upon, is the practice, after the birth of a child, of
<b>artificially prolonging the period of lactation</b>, since it is well known
that during lactation the menstrual periods often fail to occur,
and that fertilization is exceptional. Upon the recognition of this
causal sequence, notwithstanding the fact that it does not possess
any absolute validity, there has recently been founded a very
remarkable method of practical malthusianism, which the two
discoverers, Karl <span class="nowrap">Buttenstedt<a id="FNanchor724"></a><a href="#Footnote724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></span>
and Richard E. <span class="nowrap">Funcke,<a id="FNanchor725"></a><a href="#Footnote725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></span> have
announced to their astonished contemporaries as a &#8220;new revelation,&#8221;
and as the realization of &#8220;happiness in marriage.&#8221; These
remarkable apostles have combined another observation with the
one mentioned above of the relative infertility of women during
lactation, the new observation being that sometimes by the
mammary glands of women who are not pregnant, and even by
those of virgins, milk is secreted, especially during menstruation.
This fact was known to earlier gynecologists, as, for example, to
Dietrich Wilhelm <span class="nowrap">Busch.<a id="FNanchor726"></a><a href="#Footnote726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></span></p>

<p>Buttenstedt, to whom the &#8220;priority&#8221; of the new doctrine of
happiness unquestionably belongs, an advocate of the extremely
optimistic theory of the possibility of an everlasting life for
humanity and of the cessation of death (!), also conceived the
idea of evoking lactation artificially in <b>all</b> women by means of
the sucking of their breasts by men! In this way he believed
that artificial sterility and amenorrh&#339;a might be produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page701">[701]</span></p>

<p>Naturally, also, woman&#8217;s milk is regarded as an elixir of life
for old men, a true panacea for the elongation of life <i>ad infinitum</i>;
and this &#8220;happy marriage&#8221; in itself is to be a means by which
all the possible ills of degenerate humanity are to be cured. In
this p&aelig;an he is joined by Funcke, who regards woman&#8217;s milk as
&#8220;the best, most natural, and most valuable drug,&#8221; and on p. 70
of his book preaches to girls and women the &#8220;new categorical
imperative&#8221; (<i>sic</i>).</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not leave thy vital force unutilized; thou shalt not
menstruate unless thou hast the firm will and desire to become pregnant;
thou shalt allow thy vital force in the form of milk to flow
from thy breasts for the benefit and enjoyment of other human
beings.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Buttenstedt, who possesses some historical knowledge, wishes
also to make the breasts of men lactiferous (p. 24), so that the
sexes can exchange their &#8220;blood through the breasts,&#8221; thus
become more and more alike one another, and ultimately become
urnings!</p>

<p>This beautiful lactation idyll or, more correctly, mammalian
idyll, will not bear the test of scientific criticism. In the first
place, the effect of the proposed manipulations is exceedingly
<b>dubious</b>, and would only produce the desired result in exceptional
cases; in the second place, such an artificial lactation, continued
for a long period, would be extremely <b>harmful</b>, just as an excessive
protraction of lactation after normal delivery is known to be
deleterious; and in the third place, last, not least, the reputed
anticonceptional effect would, in the majority of cases, <b>fail to
occur</b>. At any rate, there appears to be no reason why pregnancy
should not ensue, since the condition of the genital organs
would apparently permit this, and would certainly differ from
that which obtains in women who give suck in a normal manner
after giving birth to a child.</p>

<p>2. <b>Divergences from the Normal Mode of Coitus.</b>&mdash;Attempts
have been made to prevent fertilization by means of various
modifications of the sexual act. Thus, starting from the old
belief that active participation in the sexual act on the part of
the woman, as well as libido and the sexual orgasm on her part,
are indispensable prerequisites of the occurrence of impregnation,
a more passive demeanour of the woman has been recommended&mdash;a
distraction of the mind and the senses from the sexual act,
after the manner of the <i>cong-fou</i> of the Chinese, who frequently
employ this trick during intercourse. This opinion is deceptive,
for, in the absence of all activity and orgasm on the part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page702">[702]</span>
woman, in the most diverse conditions possible, conception may
<span class="nowrap">ensue.<a id="FNanchor727"></a><a href="#Footnote727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></span>
Thus, in this case also we have to do with a quite untrustworthy
method.</p>

<p><b>Trustworthy</b>, on the other hand, and therefore extremely widely
diffused, is the so-called <b>coitus interruptus</b>&mdash;interrupted intercourse,
in which the penis is withdrawn from the vagina shortly
before the ejaculation of the semen (so-called &#8220;withdrawal,&#8221;
&#8220;Zuruckziehen,&#8221; &#8220;Sichinachtnehmen,&#8221; &#8220;fraudieren,&#8221; &#8220;congressus
reservatus, onanismus conjugalis&#8221;). The views regarding the
harmfulness of this method, by which pregnancy can certainly
be prevented, have in recent years undergone considerable
change, in so far as the disadvantages are to-day considered less
serious than they formerly were. More especially, Dr. Alfred
Damm, in his work &#8220;Neura,&#8221; overestimated the harmful effects
of <i>coitus interruptus</i>, inasmuch as he attributed to it the entire
degeneration of a race. These extreme views, supported by no
facts whatever, of the degeneration fanatic Damm are briefly
described in a little book by E. Peters, &#8220;The Sexual Life and
Nervous Energy&#8221; (Cologne,
<span class="nowrap">1906).<a id="FNanchor728"></a><a href="#Footnote728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be denied&mdash;and has, in fact, been maintained by other
physicians such as Gaillard Thomas, Goodell, Valenta, Bergeret,
Mantegazza, Payer, Mensinga, Beard, Hirt, Eulenburg, Freud,
von Tschich, Gattel, and others&mdash;that the &#8220;ineffective&#8221; excitement
occurring during <i>coitus interruptus</i>, the absence of the
natural discharge of sexual tension, the voluntary postponement
of ejaculation, the strain put upon the will during the sexual
act, may have a transient harmful influence upon the nervous
system; but, according to recent researches, it is only in those
who are <b>already</b> neuropathic that permanent troubles result,
in the form of &#8220;<b>anxiety-neurosis</b>&#8221; (which, as
<span class="nowrap">Freud<a id="FNanchor729"></a><a href="#Footnote729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></span> has proved,
is actually dependent upon <i>coitus interruptus</i>), or in the form of
other neurasthenic and hysterical troubles, and also sometimes
of local irritative conditions. The harmful influence of frustrated
sexual excitement is shown also by the frequency of nervous
troubles during the period of engagement, which, as a witty
colleague of mine remarked, must be regarded as a single, long-drawn-out
<i>coitus interruptus</i>. But it has not been proved that<span class="pagenum" id="Page703">[703]</span>
in healthy individuals <i>coitus interruptus</i>, even when the practice
is continued for a long time, gives rise to serious and permanent
injuries to health. According to the experience of F&uuml;rbringer,
Oppenheim, von Krafft-Ebing, Rohleder, Spener, and, above
all, of L. L&ouml;wenfeld, who has instituted exceptionally exact
researches into the matter, such consequences are quite exceptional.
This is also true of the disorders which <i>coitus interruptus</i>
is reputed to cause in women.</p>

<p>Another method for the prevention of pregnancy, which,
according to Barrucco, is practised especially in Italy, is the prolongation
of sexual enjoyment by means of <b>repeated</b> interruptions
of the act, followed by <b>renewed</b> erections. This, naturally, is
extremely harmful. F&uuml;rbringer, however, reports the case of
certain frigid men who were able to extend the act of conjugal
intercourse for long periods, without any disastrous effect upon
their health. One of these men was able to find time during the
act for smoking and reading!</p>

<p>3. <b>Mechanical Means for the Prevention of Conception.</b>&mdash;According
to Kisch, in Transylvania and in France a method is in
use according to which, during the sexual act, the woman, at
the commencement of ejaculation in the male, presses her finger
forcibly upon the root of his penis just in front of the prostate
gland. In this way the passage through the urethra is temporarily
occluded, and ejaculation of the semen is prevented: it regurgitates
into the bladder, and is subsequently evacuated with the
urine. Unquestionably this manipulation would be likely to
prove exceedingly injurious to health.</p>

<p>In Italy and in New Guinea many women expel the semen
from the vagina, as soon as coitus is completed, by means of
muscular action, by vigorous movements of the perineum.</p>

<p>A mechanical apparatus for the prevention of conception which
is unquestionably carefully thought out is the so-called <b>occlusive
pessary</b> of Dr. Mensinga&mdash;a hemisphere of rubber surrounded
by a steel ring, introduced into the vagina before coitus, and even
left <i>in situ</i> for prolonged periods, so that the os uteri is occluded.
When accurately applied, it does, in fact, definitely prevent
fertilization. Various considerations, however, render its use
undesirable: (1) the difficulty of the introduction, which most
women are unable to master; (2) liability to displacement of
the pessary during the act; (3) the occurrence of irritative
conditions of various kinds (discharges, diseases of the uterine
annexa, etc.), if, as often happens, the pessary is allowed to
remain in the vagina for a long time. Recently a pessary has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page704">[704]</span>
constructed of waterproof cambric, which is said not to produce
any such irritative reaction. Moreover, Mensinga himself, and
Earlet, have made other improvements upon the occlusive pessary.
Easier to introduce is Gall&#8217;s &#8220;balloon occlusive pessary.&#8221; In this
instrument, by means of a compressible rubber ball and tubing,
air is blown into the interior of a thin-walled rubber ring which
surrounds a soft elastic rubber disc. A <b>dangerous</b> article, and
<b>one to be avoided</b>, is Hollweg&#8217;s &#8220;obturator.&#8221; The ideal mechanical
means for the prevention of pregnancy is, once more, the <b>condom</b>,
regarding the application and qualities of which we have already
said all that is necessary (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page378">pp. 378</a>, <a href="#Page379">379</a>). Simple in
its mode of application, it is, when of good quality, certain in
its effect, and is relatively the <b>most harmless</b> of all preventive
measures. When it is used, coitus runs a perfectly normal course,
with the sole exception of the sensation during ejaculation.
We must reject as harmful the use of the so-called &#8220;stimulant
condom,&#8221; which bears a ring of spines or points, in order to
increase libido in the woman.</p>

<p>4. <b>Chemical Physical Preventive Measures.</b>&mdash;To these belong,
above all, <b>douching</b> of the vagina immediately after sexual
intercourse, for which purpose cold water, solutions of alum
(1 per cent.), copper sulphate (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 per cent.), sulphate of
quinine (1&nbsp;: 400), etc., may be used. The douching must be
effected when the woman is in the recumbent posture, and the
vaginal tube must be introduced deeply. This method, however,
is very <span class="nowrap"><b>untrustworthy</b>.<a id="FNanchor730"></a><a href="#Footnote730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></span></p>

<p>The same is true of attempts to destroy the spermatozoa by
the insufflation of chemically active <b>powders</b>; or by the insertion
of antiseptic &#8220;<b>security sponges</b>,&#8221; which Rohleder has rightly
named &#8220;insecurity sponges&#8221;; untrustworthy also is the combination
of these with mechanical apparatus.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>The number of articles belonging to this category is legion. I need
mention a few only: &#8220;Security ovals,&#8221; containing boric acid, quinine,
or citric acid; &#8220;little vaginal plugs&#8221;; &#8220;salus ovula&#8221;; Kamp&#8217;s anticonceptional
cotton-wool plugs; H&uuml;ter&#8217;s vaginal insufflator &#8220;for the
malthusian&#8221;; Noffke&#8217;s tampon-speculum;

Weissl&#8217;s preservative (a combination of speculum and rubber disc<span class="pagenum" id="Page705">[705]</span>
with a steel spring and a cotton-wool plug impregnated with a drug);
the &#8220;Venus apparatus&#8221; (a double rubber ball, the smaller ball filled
with &#8220;Venus powder&#8221; (<i>sic</i>) being introduced within the vagina,
whilst the woman herself, at the moment of ejaculation, presses the
larger ball lying near to her thighs, whereupon the powder is expelled
from the smaller ball into the vagina); the &#8220;duplex occlusive pessary&#8221;
(an occlusive pessary with double walls, perforated with round apertures,
containing in its interior boric acid tablets for the purpose of
killing the spermatozoa).</p>

<p>It may be that now and again, by some of the means just
mentioned, conception may be prevented. But on the whole
they are very uncertain; and, on the other hand, it is doubtful
if the chemical substances introduced in this way are harmless.
It is possible that many peculiar inflammatory conditions of the
male and female genital organs may be referred to their use.
For example, <span class="nowrap">Blumreich<a id="FNanchor732"></a><a href="#Footnote732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></span>
reports the case of a man who, after
coitus in which a means of this kind had been used, had an extremely
obstinate inflammatory eruption upon the penis.</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>I take this opportunity of pointing out that the so-called <b>herpes
progenitalis</b>, a peculiar vesicular eruption of the genital organs, occurring
chiefly in males, which alarms a great many patients, because
they regard it as the result of syphilitic infection, is, in the great
majority of cases, a perfectly harmless affection caused by some
transient <span class="nowrap">irritation.<a id="FNanchor733"></a><a href="#Footnote733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned methods for the prevention of
pregnancy, we have also to consider two radical means of practical
malthusianism which belong to the <b>purely medical</b> province,
and can <b>only</b> be employed when life and death are involved,
when pregnancy and parturition would entail upon the woman
severe illness or certain death. These two means are the operative
induction of <b>artificial sterility</b> and <b>artificial abortion</b>.</p>

<p>Artificial sterility can be produced by various measures, as by
the intentionally effected <b>malposition</b> of the uterus, such as
is practised among the indigens of the Malay Archipelago; by
<b>section of the Fallopian tubes</b>, as recommended by Kehrer; by
the so-called <i>castratio uterina</i> by means of <b>vaporization</b> (the
application of superheated steam by the method of Pincus,
whereby menstruation is suspended and the uterine cavity is
obliterated); and finally by <b>castration</b> proper, the <b>extirpation</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page706">[706]</span>
<b>of the</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>ovaries</b><a id="FNanchor734"></a><a href="#Footnote734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></span>
(<b>o&ouml;phorectomy</b>, spaying, Battey&#8217;s operation),
which was carried out in ancient times by quite savage races,
in order to prevent <span class="nowrap">reproduction.<a id="FNanchor735"></a><a href="#Footnote735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></span>
In France, theoretically
anti-malthusian, but practically through and through malthusian,

<p class="noindent">&mdash;it appears, according to recent
<span class="nowrap">descriptions,<a id="FNanchor736"></a><a href="#Footnote736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></span> that o&ouml;phorectomy
is greatly prized by distinguished ladies as a means for the prevention
of pregnancy. It is said that there even exist &#8220;specialists&#8221;
for the production of these child-hating &#8220;<i>ovari&eacute;es</i>,&#8221; men
who undertake this operation at a high fee. In Germany, happily,
this radical measure for the prevention of conception is not
employed in healthy persons; the operation is performed only in
women who are seriously ill, and strictly for therapeutic purposes.</p>

<p>The preventive measures previously mentioned, if we except
<i>coitus interruptus</i> and the condom, are all very untrustworthy,
as we learn from the extreme frequency of deliberate, artificial
abortion in all countries, and among all classes of the
<span class="nowrap">population.<a id="FNanchor737"></a><a href="#Footnote737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></span>
Artificial abortion is, as is well known, a criminal offence, punishable
by a long term of imprisonment for all those concerned, the
pregnant woman herself and her accomplices. In the Orient and
among savage races, however, abortion is not punishable. Among
the civilized nations of Europe artificial abortion is punished;
in Germany the mere <b>attempt</b> at abortion is punishable, even
though only an imaginary pregnancy is present. That the State
must take steps to prevent abortion, as an immoral and unnatural
action, is obvious, and this is necessary above all because intentional
abortion in so many cases endangers the life and health of
women. But in order that such punishment should be reasonable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page707">[707]</span>
it is essential that society should work to this end, that
the <b>social conditions</b> upon which the frequency of the practice
depends should be abolished; <b>society should abandon the artificial
defamation of illegitimate motherhood</b>, and should in every
possible way work for the improvement of the possibilities of
motherhood&mdash;should found homes for mothers and for pregnant
women, should provide for the insurance of mothers, etc. It
is a remarkable contradiction, to which Gisela von
<span class="nowrap">Streitberg<a id="FNanchor738"></a><a href="#Footnote738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></span>
draws attention, that illegitimate pregnancy is regarded as sinful
and shameful: simultaneously the life of the child <b>about to be
born</b> is regarded as sacred; whilst this same child, <b>as soon as it
is born</b>, is once more regarded as infamous. In fact, to the
illegitimate child, in the social morality of our time, which is
at once ridiculous and profoundly perverted, there inevitably
attaches something despicable and dishonourable. It is right
that those who make the procuring of abortion a <b>professional
occupation</b> should be severely punished; but, on the other hand,
it is doubtful whether it is right to punish mothers, and more
particularly the mothers of illegitimate infants, against whom the
Criminal Code is especially directed, for artificially inducing
abortion. It is, in fact, open to question whether the punishment is
even legal. It is well known that according to &sect; 1 of the Civil Code
the rights of a human being are said to begin only with the completion
of <span class="nowrap">birth,<a id="FNanchor739"></a><a href="#Footnote739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></span>
and it is certainly open to question whether the
as yet undeveloped human f&#339;tus has any personal rights at all.
Without doubt we have to do with a being which has not yet
begun to exist, but which is only in process of becoming. Thus,
juristically, and from the standpoint of the philosophy of law,
the foundation for the punishment for abortion is a very unstable
one. Consider, for example, impregnation resulting from <b>rape</b>.
Should not the woman concerned have the right to employ any
and all means available to her to destroy at the very outset the
child thus <b>forced upon her</b>?</p>

<p>The means for the induction of
<span class="nowrap">abortion<a id="FNanchor740"></a><a href="#Footnote740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></span> prior to the
twenty-eighth or thirtieth week of pregnancy are very various,
and may be considered under the two categories of <b>internal</b> and
<b>mechanical</b> means respectively. Infallible internal abortifacients<span class="pagenum" id="Page708">[708]</span>
<b>do not exist</b>; and almost all abortifacients are <b>dangerous</b> owing
to their toxic effects. Those most commonly employed are ergot,
ethereal oil of savin (<i>Juniperus sabina</i>), varieties of thuja, yew
(<i>Taxus baccata</i>), turpentine, oleum succini, tansy, rue, camphor,
cantharides, aloes, phosphorus, etc. Mechanically, abortion may
be effected by blows, by violent movements (for example, during
coitus), massage, perforation of the membranes, hot injections,
steam, manipulations with the finger at the os uteri, the
introduction of sounds and other objects through the os uteri,
venesection, application of the electric current, etc. With all
these practices there is involved great danger of injury, poisoning,
infection, rupture and perforation of the uterus, the entry of
air into the uterine veins, scalding of the internal genital organs,
etc. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that death so frequently
ensues, and that almost always severe illnesses result from the use
of these abortifacients.</p>

<p>The State would in this way best put a stop to artificial abortion
if, in addition to the above-mentioned removal of the disgrace
attached to illegitimate motherhood, it diffused widely among
all classes of society a knowledge of the <b>permissible</b> means for the
prevention of pregnancy.</p>

<p>The fact that neo-malthusian methods are chiefly employed <b>in
large towns</b>, indicates their dependence upon economical considerations,
and upon the struggle for existence, which is
especially severe in large towns. Hope for the future rests
upon the removal of moral and legal coercion in marriage, in
which Gutzkow (&#8220;S&auml;kularbilder,&#8221; i. 174, 175) saw the principal
causes of social and sexual misery; and upon the rational regulation
of methods for the prevention of pregnancy, which must be
regarded as in no way identical with the hostility to &#8220;fruitfulness&#8221;
in the sense of Weininger. On the contrary, the yearning
for children, and the joy in their possession, will then, for the
first time, obtain their natural satisfaction.</p>

The ancients were also familiar with preventive methods of intercourse and
with abortion. Widely renowned is the passage of the historian Polybius
(XXXVII. ix. 5) in which we read: &#8220;In my time the whole of Greece suffered
from <b>an insufficiency of children</b>&mdash;speaking generally, from <b>a lack of men</b>; for
men had become so much accustomed to good living, to the greed for money, and
to every comfort, that <b>they no longer wished to marry, or, at any rate, they
wished to have only a few children</b>. Not the sword of the enemy was it that
depopulated the ancient States, but the lack of offspring.&#8221; In Spain also, in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in consequence of the wealth acquired in the
New World, there resulted an overwhelming dread of marriage and child-bearing,
so that the population became reduced to nine millions, and the bringing up
of four children was rewarded with a title of nobility (<i>cf.</i> J. Unold, &#8220;Duties and
Aims of Human Life,&#8221; p. 110; Leipzig, 1904).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<p class="noindent">Sexual hygiene in individual relationships has already been
discussed in previous chapters, and more especially in those
upon the prophylaxis and suppression of venereal diseases, upon
the question of sexual abstinence, upon sexual education, and
upon the use of methods for the prevention of pregnancy. Here
we merely propose to deal shortly with the <b>social</b> relationships of
the hygiene of the sexual life. After Darwin, more particularly
in his work on the &#8220;Descent of Man,&#8221; had published fundamental
observations regarding the social importance of sexual hygiene,
other writers, influenced by recent anthropological and ethnological
research, occupied themselves with these problems, more
especially <span class="nowrap">Hegar,<a id="FNanchor741"></a><a href="#Footnote741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></span>
A. <span class="nowrap">Ploetz,<a id="FNanchor742"></a><a href="#Footnote742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></span> and
R. <span class="nowrap">Kossmann;<a id="FNanchor743"></a><a href="#Footnote743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></span> the subjects
considered by these writers have been aptly comprised under the
name &#8220;<b>reproductive hygiene</b>,&#8221; which constitutes a part of general
racial biology.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, racial biology, as Max
<span class="nowrap">Gruber<a id="FNanchor744"></a><a href="#Footnote744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></span> justly remarks,
has formed exaggerated estimates of the ideas of &#8220;degeneration&#8221;
and &#8220;hereditary taint&#8221;; and, on the other hand, the complementary
ideas of &#8220;regeneration&#8221; and &#8220;hereditary enfranchisement&#8221;
have been unduly neglected. And yet it is certain that
these latter influences are continually in active operation in the
direction of the resanation and invigoration of the race: that
the introduction of <b>new and healthy blood</b> is competent to
bring about reanimation and regeneration, even in degenerate
families. Gruber says with justice (&#8220;Hygiene of the Sexual
Life,&#8221; p. 55, 1905):</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Completely normal, and entirely free from hereditary taint, no
single human being can be; and, on the other hand, experience teaches
us, that just as morbid tendencies make their appearance in certain
families, so also <b>they may disappear</b> from these families. Many of
these tendencies can be rendered ineffective by a suitably chosen mode
of life for the individual; and by means of repeated crossing with
stems which are free from these particular taints, the morbid
tendency can be led to disappear, unless the degenerative impulse is
too powerful.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page712">[712]</span></p>

<p>The recognition of this fact does not in the least diminish the
great importance of purposive choice in love and marriage; nor
does it diminish the sense of sexual responsibility in relation to
the great fact of <b>heredity</b>. But the recognition of the fortunate
fact of hereditary enfranchisement supports, on the other hand,
all our endeavours in the direction of rational &#8220;eugenics&#8221;
<span class="nowrap">(Galton),<a id="FNanchor745"></a><a href="#Footnote745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></span>
in accordance with which we must, as Nietzsche says,
not merely reproduce, but produce in an upward direction
(&#8220;<i>nicht bloss fort-, sondern auch <b>hinaufpflanzen</b> sollen</i>&#8221;).</p>

<p>The central problem of reproductive hygiene is that of <b>love&#8217;s
choice</b>, of sexual selection. It is a most difficult task, one which
is rarely fulfilled to the utmost, for the right man to find the
right woman, so that their individualities may in every respect
correspond to and complement one another. In most cases it is
necessary to be contented with relative harmony, and with
sufficient <b>health</b> on both sides. The laws of a refined, differentiated
marriage choice have not yet been discovered. Havelock
<span class="nowrap">Ellis<a id="FNanchor746"></a><a href="#Footnote746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></span>
has instituted exhaustive researches on this subject, without,
however, attaining any positive result. He was only able to
establish the general proposition, that in love&#8217;s choice <b>identity
of race</b> and of <b>individual</b> characters (homogamy), and at the
same time <b>unlikeness in the secondary sexual</b> characters (heterogamy),
are to be preferred. In other respects, however, very
various and complicated influences are determinative in sexual
selection. Havelock Ellis also detected a natural disinclination
towards love between blood-relatives, which, however, he
regards as merely due to the customary life in close association
from childhood onwards.</p>

<p>Darwin propounded the principle for sexual selection, that both
sexes should avoid marriage when in any pronounced degree
they were defective, either physically or mentally. Upon this
idea rests the old and widely diffused custom of killing or
exposure of sickly children, as well as the more recent prohibitions
of marriage in certain States of the American Union&mdash;for
example, Michigan, in which the marriage (also sexual union
for procreative purposes?) is forbidden on the part of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page713">[713]</span>
mentally diseased and of those who are infected with tubercle or
<span class="nowrap">syphilis.<a id="FNanchor747"></a><a href="#Footnote747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important fundamental principle, however, of rational
reproductive hygiene is, without doubt, that only <b>healthy</b> individuals
should pair, or, at any rate, those only whose abnormalities
or diseases, if any, would not injure their offspring, physically
or mentally. Not in disease itself, but in the <b>inheritance</b> of
disease, lies the great danger for the deterioration of the family
and the race. It is for this reason that the study of the
inheritance of morbid predispositions and morbid constitutions
is of such enormous importance in racial biology.</p>

<p>With regard to illnesses to which attention must especially be
paid in connexion with sexual selection, we have here, in the
first place, to consider the &#8220;three scourges&#8221; of humanity:
<b>alcoholism</b>, <b>syphilis</b>, and <b>tuberculosis</b>.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that alcoholism leads in the drinker himself
to nervous weakness, to mental disturbances of all kinds
(delirium tremens, imbecility, mania, peripheral neuritis, etc.), it
also exercises a very serious influence upon the offspring, who
are, unfortunately, in many cases very
<span class="nowrap">numerous,<a id="FNanchor748"></a><a href="#Footnote748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></span> as the study
of &#8220;drinker families&#8221; shows (<i>cf.</i> J&ouml;rger, &#8220;The Family Zero,&#8221;
published in the <i>Archives for Racial Biology</i>, 1905, vol. ii., pp.
494-559). Only a very small fraction of the offspring of such
families are physically and mentally normal (about 7 to 17&nbsp;%);
the majority display a <b>rapidly progressive degeneration</b>, which
manifests itself physically more especially by the tendency
to tuberculosis and epilepsy, and mentally by the tendency to
drunkenness, crime, and imbecility. Alcohol is a direct poison
to the germ cells, so much so that, according to the degree of
drunkenness, it is almost possible to estimate beforehand the
degree of hereditary taint. Moreover, an <b>otherwise healthy</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page714">[714]</span>
father, in a single severe acute alcoholic intoxication, may procreate
a child either quite incompetent to live, or weakly, or
completely degenerate. On the other hand, it has been observed
that a person given to chronic alcoholism is competent, during
a temporary <b>diminution</b> in his consumption of alcohol, to procreate
a comparatively vigorous child. From this it follows that marriage,
or sexual union in general for reproductive purposes, with
a man or woman addicted to alcohol, and no less the act of procreation
in a state of intoxication, are absolutely to be condemned.</p>

<p>The danger of alcoholism to the offspring is illustrated by the
experience that about one-eighth of the surviving children of
drunken parents become affected with epilepsy, and that more than
one-half of idiotic children are born of drunken parents (Kraepelin,
&#8220;The Psychiatric Duties of the State,&#8221; p. 3; Jena, 1900).</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter (<a href="#Page361">pp. 361</a>-<a href="#Page363">363</a>) attention was drawn to
the fact that syphilis rivals alcohol in its potency as a cause of
racial <span class="nowrap">degeneration.<a id="FNanchor749"></a><a href="#Footnote749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></span>
Thanks to the researches of Alfred Fournier
and of Tarnowsky, the sinister influence of syphilis in this respect
is now widely recognized. E. Heddaeus
<span class="nowrap">rightly<a id="FNanchor750"></a><a href="#Footnote750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></span> asserts that
since at the present day the whole world is contaminated with
congenital or acquired syphilis, the eradication of syphilis is the
most important task of reproductive hygiene. The previously
mentioned etiological and prophylactic-therapeutic researches,
among which may be included the quite recent discovery of
syphilitic antibodies in the system of those who have formerly
suffered from <span class="nowrap">syphilis,<a id="FNanchor751"></a><a href="#Footnote751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></span>
open to us a prospect of the realization
of this magnificent idea. The weakening and degeneration of
the individual by acquired and inherited syphilis, is also shown
by the recent researches into the influence of syphilis upon the
duration of life, among which I may mention the works of A.
<span class="nowrap">Blaschko<a id="FNanchor752"></a><a href="#Footnote752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></span>
and Hans <span class="nowrap">Tilesius.<a id="FNanchor753"></a><a href="#Footnote753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></span>
Regarding the disastrous influence
of syphilis continued into the second and third generations,
see the monograph of B. Tarnowsky, &#8220;La Famille Syphilitique et
sa Descendence&#8221; [Clermont (Oise), 1904]. (See note <a href="#Footnote325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
to <a href="#Page363">p. 363</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page715">[715]</span></p>

<p>The third disease leading to degeneration is tuberculosis, which
may be inherited either by direct infection of the germ, or (more
frequently) by the transmission of a predisposition to the offspring.
This simple predisposition, recognized by the so-called
&#8220;tubercular physique&#8221; (long, thin individuals, with a flattened
chest, poorly developed muscles, and a pale countenance), does
not offer any absolute ground for prohibiting reproductive
activity, since the health of the other party to the marriage
may diminish or entirely remove the danger of inheritance.
But, on the other hand, manifest tuberculosis or scrofula is a
contra-indication to marriage.</p>

<p>The same is true of actual <b>mental disorders</b>, of severe diatheses,
such as gout, obesity, or diabetes; and of cancer and other malignant
tumours; whereas the bulk of &#8220;nervous&#8221; affections and
other bodily diseases only exclude marriage in certain special
<span class="nowrap">circumstances.<a id="FNanchor754"></a><a href="#Footnote754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></span></p>

<p>Very unfavourable to the offspring is the atrophy of the female
breasts, and the consequent incapacity for lactation, a matter
to which <span class="nowrap">Mensinga,<a id="FNanchor755"></a><a href="#Footnote755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></span>
G. von <span class="nowrap">Bunge,<a id="FNanchor756"></a><a href="#Footnote756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></span> G.
<span class="nowrap">Hirth,<a id="FNanchor757"></a><a href="#Footnote757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></span> Emil
<span class="nowrap">Abderhalden,<a id="FNanchor758"></a><a href="#Footnote758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></span>
A. <span class="nowrap">Hegar,<a id="FNanchor759"></a><a href="#Footnote759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></span>
and others, have referred, and which exercises a very
unfavourable influence upon the offspring, since natural lactation
cannot be adequately replaced by artificial feeding. According
to Bunge, alcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis, and mental disorders
of the ancestry are the principal causes of atrophy of the mammary
glands. Whether atrophy of the mammary glands is really
on the increase, and whether it is hereditary, are matters demanding,
as Abderhalden insists, more careful critical investigation.</p>

<p>Marriage at an age <b>too youthful</b> (below twenty on the part of
the woman, below twenty-four on the part of the man) and at
<b>too advanced</b> an age (above forty on the part of the woman,
above fifty on the part of the man) is also disadvantageous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page716">[716]</span>
the offspring, as manifested by higher mortality of the infants,
by the more frequent occurrence of malformations, idiotcy,
rickets, etc. Equally disadvantageous is <b>too close relationship
by</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>blood</b>,<a id="FNanchor760"></a><a href="#Footnote760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></span>
since in this way any unfavourable tendencies are
greatly strengthened. Upon a certain degree of inbreeding, or,
rather, upon an approximation to inbreeding, depends the formation
of every race. The &#8220;racial problem&#8221; in this sense is a kind
of exaltation of the inbreeding principle, for the very idea of
<b>race</b> implies a more or less close relationship between all the
members of a definite stock. Thus the entire absence of fresh
blood does not necessarily give rise to any degeneration; but it is
certain that <b>long-continued close in-and-in breeding</b> on the part
of near blood-relatives in the same family results in a <b>progressive
tendency to degeneration</b>, because, among those who unite in
marriage, the same morbid tendencies are present, and accumulate
in consequence of the inbreeding. This is shown very
clearly by some statistics collected by Morris (published by
Gruber, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 32). Marriage between uncle and niece, or
between aunt and nephew, and the, unfortunately, far too frequent
marriages between first cousins, are therefore to be condemned.</p>

<p>The greatest value is to be placed, in love&#8217;s choice, upon
<b>intellectual</b> qualities. Intelligent persons, and those full of
character, are to be preferred. Precisely in relation to the breeding
of talents, Nietzsche recommended (&#8220;Posthumous Works,&#8221;
vol. xii., p. 188; Leipzig, 1901) polygamy for men or women of
predominant intellectual capacity, so that they might have the
opportunity of reproducing their kind in intercourse with several
persons of the opposite sex, and in this way, since the later
children of the same women are not so powerful nor of such
striking capacity as the first-born, they might have the possibility
of being the parents of several talented and distinguished
individuals. In relation to the woman&#8217;s question, the breeding
of women well endowed with talent is a matter of especial interest.
Charles <span class="nowrap">Darwin<a id="FNanchor761"></a><a href="#Footnote761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></span> writes:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;In order that woman should reach the same standard as man, she
ought, when nearly adult, to be trained to energy and perseverance,
and to have her reason and imagination exercised to the highest
point; then she would probably transmit these qualities chiefly to her
adult daughters. All women, however, could not be thus raised,<span class="pagenum" id="Page717">[717]</span>
unless during many generations those who excelled in the above
robust virtues were married, and produced offspring in larger numbers
than other women.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>In a valuable work W. <span class="nowrap">Schallmayer<a id="FNanchor762"></a><a href="#Footnote762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></span>
has recently discussed
the great importance of the offspring of talented persons in the
improvement of the race, and has considered the details of
psychical inheritance.</p>

<p>As in the entire animal world, so also in the human race, the
feminine nature has a more conservative character, one more
disinclined to variations, whether favourable or unfavourable,
as contrasted with the more variable nature of the male, which
is also more prone to submit to degenerative influences. For this
reason, in declining races, we meet many more women free from
degeneration than men. Carl Vogt, in a passage which appears
to be very little known, writes on this subject in the following
<span class="nowrap">terms:<a id="FNanchor763"></a><a href="#Footnote763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;It is the women, my friend, who maintain the race, who for the
longest time safeguard the type of the people in body and spirit, and
for this reason they form the mirror at once of the future and of the
past which are allotted to that people. You will no doubt have noticed
how, in many races, there exists a disharmony between men and
women, so that in one race the male and in another the female stands
behind the other in physical beauty and in mental development.
This relationship between the two sexes is precisely that from which
we are able to learn the past and the future of the nation. Good and
bad, advance and retrogression, are first undertaken by the man, and
by him passed to the woman, whose conservative nature much more
gradually yields to strange influences. But since the stages of mental
culture through which a race passes are not only reflected in its bodily
development, but actually depend upon this development, it is easy
to understand that in a nature which is striving upwards, which we
see in the process of advance towards better things, the men possess
the advantage in the matter of beauty and of intellectual capacity;
whereas when the race is a declining one, the advantages in these
respects will lie with woman. If you find a race in which the women
are beautiful, but as a rule the men are ugly and badly formed, you can
with certainty conclude that this race has long since passed its culminating
point in development, and has long been undergoing a process
of decline.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>For racial biology it is at least equally important, if not even
more important, that healthy, vigorous, and talented men<span class="pagenum" id="Page718">[718]</span>
should reproduce their kind, rather than that in love&#8217;s choice
the corresponding qualities in women should be regarded as determinative.
Racial biology, if it really wishes to obtain success in
the breeding of humanity, is compelled to demand the abolition
of the present evil coercive marriage morality, and, according to
the suggestions of Nietzsche, von Ehrenfels, and others, will not
hesitate, <b>in certain cases</b>, to regard polygamy as desirable, if
only from this standpoint&mdash;that coercive marriage is the sole
cause of the domination of &#8220;mammonism&#8221; in the sexual life,
to the deleterious influence of which we have before
<span class="nowrap">alluded.<a id="FNanchor764"></a><a href="#Footnote764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></span></p>

<p>Mammonism is dangerous if for this alone, because it involves
<b>the annihilation of the sense of sexual responsibility</b>, and in
consequence of this, natural love is rejected on one side, and all
considerations of a racial hygienic nature are cast away on the
other. The lack of both is the cause of degeneration.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>

<p class="noindent">In this age of commerce, of telegraphs, and of the press, the r&ocirc;le
which the sexual life plays <b>before the public eye</b> is notably greater
than it used to be. From very early times, indeed, sexual
matters formed the principal constituent of the <i>chronique
scandaleuse</i>, but it was not then possible to disseminate such
scandals by means of daily newspapers, as it is now so easy to
do. In three forms at the present day the sexual life attains
publicity: in the form of an unscrupulous <b>quackery</b>; in the
form of <b>newspaper advertisements</b> relating to the sexual life;
and in the form of <b>sexual scandals</b> diffused by means of the press.
We propose to refer briefly to the principal aspects of all
three, and we shall find that they are, for the most part, of an
unpleasant character.</p>

<p>According to the well-known saying that hunger and love rule
the world, quackery has from its very earliest beginnings concerned
itself by preference with the provinces of disorders of digestion
and of sexual troubles; and especially in respect of the latter
have its developments been so astounding&mdash;in fact, there appears
to be nothing else which gives such instructive information regarding
the possibilities of human folly, depravity, and superstition.
When we regard the history of quackery and medical
charlatanry of all <span class="nowrap">times,<a id="FNanchor765"></a><a href="#Footnote765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></span>
we discern beyond question the justice
of the assertion that &#8220;<b>quackery is identical with the diffusion
of sexual vice and of fornication</b>.&#8221; These relationships of
quackery to the sexual life and to sexual crime have recently
had a vivid light thrown upon them by C.
<span class="nowrap">Reissig<a id="FNanchor766"></a><a href="#Footnote766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></span>
and C. <span class="nowrap">Alexander.<a id="FNanchor767"></a><a href="#Footnote767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></span></p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Reissig deals more especially with the &#8220;immoral practices of many
magnetizers, lay hypnotizers, and similar individuals, who, under the
pretence of giving help to the sick, seek and find opportunity for the
gratification of <b>all kinds of immoral lusts</b>&#8221;; and he gives characteristic
examples of these practices. Police reports have shown that numerous
<i>masseuses</i> and male quacks, who commonly appear under the
high-sounding names of &#8220;professor,&#8221; &#8220;director,&#8221; &#8220;hygienologist,&#8221;
&#8220;magnetopath,&#8221; etc., and who profess to treat &#8220;secret diseases&#8221; or
&#8220;diseases of women,&#8221; are in reality concerned with <b>abortion mongering,
the production of artificial sexual excitement, and the provision<span class="pagenum" id="Page722">[722]</span>
of human material for the gratification of perverse lusts</b>. Who does
not know the ominous words, &#8220;<i>Rat und Hilfe!</i>&#8221; (&#8220;Advice and help!&#8221;)?
Under the mantle of quackery the worst kinds of immorality are practised.
Thus, Alexander (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 48) speaks of an &#8220;ear specialist&#8221;
who, paving the way by gigantic advertisements in the local papers,
travelled from place to place, nominally in order to relieve &#8220;defects
of hearing,&#8221; but who in reality utilized his opportunities in order to
make immoral attempts upon young girls (Glatz Assizes, July 10, 1896).
The &#8220;magnetizer&#8221; <span class="nowrap">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> hypnotized young girls, and then violated
them; another examined the genital organs when professing to treat
ear troubles, and carried out improper manipulations. In an article,
&#8220;Serene Highness&#8217;s Quackery,&#8221; in the <i>Aerztliche Vereinsblatt</i>, No. 418,
August, 1900, Dr. Reissig reports that &#8220;to Her Serene Highness the
Princess Maria von Rohan in Salzburg&#8221; it appears to be a sacred duty
to bear witness to the joiner (!) Kuhne, in Leipzig, under date November
9, 1889, that his sexual friction baths (!) &#8220;had proved to be of
inestimable value, and had had a wonderful effect,&#8221; and she felt
impelled &#8220;to recommend to physicians the most careful examination
and trial of this new method of cure.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The treatment of &#8220;secret
<span class="nowrap">diseases,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor768"></a><a href="#Footnote768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></span>
in the hands of quacks,
does incredible harm; and the same is true of the uncleanly
and dangerous practices of &#8220;masseuses&#8221; and of professional
abortion-mongers. Closely connected with quackery is the
<b>trade in sexual nostrums and in other articles of immoral</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>use</b>.<a id="FNanchor769"></a><a href="#Footnote769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></span>
This trade is occupied in the manufacture and public
recommendation of &#8220;sexual articles&#8221; of every kind: aphrodisiacs;
&#8220;protective articles&#8221;; various celebrated measures for
the relief of &#8220;sexual weakness,&#8221; infertility, pollutions, lack of
voluptuous sensation, etc. The artificial sterilization, not of
women, but of men, by means of Roentgen rays is
<span class="nowrap">recommended.<a id="FNanchor770"></a><a href="#Footnote770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></span>
The newspapers overflow with advertisements recommending all
these articles. Beneath the aliases of &#8220;chiromancy&#8221; and
&#8220;astrology,&#8221; sexual quackery also lies concealed. It allures its
clients chiefly by means of newspaper advertisements.</p>

<p>Newspaper advertisements for sexual purposes are not more
than 200 years old. Their oldest and most harmless form was
that of matrimonial advertisements, the first two of which appeared
on July 19, 1695, in the <i>Collection for the Improvement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page723">[723]</span>
Husbandry and Trade</i>, published by Houghton, the father of
English <span class="nowrap">advertising.<a id="FNanchor771"></a><a href="#Footnote771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></span>
These two remarkable and historical
advertisements run as follows:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A gentleman, thirty years of age, who says that he has considerable
property, would be glad to marry a young lady with property amounting
to about &pound;3,000. He will make a suitable settlement.</p>

<p>A young man, twenty-five years of age, with a good business, and
whose father is prepared to give him &pound;1,000, would be glad to make
a suitable marriage. He has been brought up by his parents as a
dissenter, and is a sober man.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>We see that from the very outset matrimonial advertisements
did not forget the <i>punctum saliens</i>, which I need not
<span class="nowrap">specify.<a id="FNanchor772"></a><a href="#Footnote772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></span>
All, down to those of the present day, are alike. The only
difference is that, in addition to these &#8220;money marriages,&#8221; advertisements
of &#8220;nominal marriages&#8221; and also of &#8220;marriages
for position&#8221; appear freely in the papers. The majority of
matrimonial advertisements are inserted for mercenary or interested
purposes, and really belong to the category of &#8220;<b>immoral
advertisements</b>,&#8221; which conceal themselves under all possible
titles. I give a short classification of some of the commonest
immoral advertisements, and append some actual advertisements
of each kind taken from leading German and Austrian newspapers.</p>

<p>1. <b>Loan Advertisements.</b>&mdash;In most cases a &#8220;young,&#8221; &#8220;smart&#8221;
lady begs an older gentleman for a loan, or <i>vice versa</i>, a young
man directs the same request to a &#8220;lady belonging to the best
circles.&#8221; Frequently also it is a &#8220;lady living alone,&#8221; &#8220;a young
widow,&#8221; or a &#8220;recently married woman,&#8221; who, &#8220;without the
knowledge of her husband,&#8221; and &#8220;in temporary want of money,&#8221;
seeks a &#8220;helper.&#8221; Almost invariably the need and the marriage
are fictitious. These are in most cases the advertisements of
secret prostitutes, of a similar character to the advertisements of
<i>masseuses</i>. The following advertisement must otherwise be interpreted:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>What noble-minded lady would be willing to lend, to a young,
widely-travelled engineer, the sum of 12,000 marks [&pound;600], for six
months, on good security?</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>2. <b>Acquaintanceship Advertisements, Friendship Advertisements,
and Employment Advertisements.</b>&mdash;These may be divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page724">[724]</span>
the two classes of heterosexual and homosexual advertisements.
Examples of the former are the following:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A young widow, twenty-seven years of age, desires friendly intercourse
with a man of position, who will assist her with word and
deed.</p>

<p>A young stranger desires acquaintanceship (!) to relieve her of a
temporary difficulty.</p>

<p>A merchant, a man of middle age, desires the acquaintanceship of
a good-looking lady (a slender figure preferred), for the purpose of
friendly intercourse.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The following advertisements have a more or less definite
homosexual note:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A well-placed young lady, nearing the age of thirty, desires an
honourable, trustworthy lady friend.</p>

<p>A cultured lady of middle age desires a ladies&#8217; club.</p>

<p>A well-placed elderly gentleman desires friendly intercourse with a
young man.</p>

<p>A young merchant, between twenty and thirty years of age, desires
friendly intercourse with a young man of good family.</p>

<p>A young lady, a stranger to the town, desires a lady friend; apply
by letter to &#8220;Lesbos&#8221; at the office of this
<span class="nowrap">paper.<a id="FNanchor773"></a><a href="#Footnote773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>A newspaper, now defunct, which formerly appeared in Munich,
characterized by homosexual &#8220;psychologico-erosophical&#8221; tendencies,
entitled <i>Der Seelenforscher</i> (edited by August Fleischmann),
appears to have laid itself open to such advertisements.
In No. 11 of the second year of issue, November, 1903, I find
the following distinctive advertisements:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A young vigorous (!) man, a Swiss, twenty-four years of age, well
recommended, desires a situation with a gentleman living alone.</p>

<p>A young man, twenty years of age, of agreeable appearance, with an
honourable and ideal mind, desires a position as correspondent or
companion in the house of a well-to-do, even if elderly, gentleman.</p>

<p>A wealthy, talented uranian young man desires the patronage of a
noble well-to-do urning.</p>

<p>A good, affectionate, and bright young man, who at the present time
is in an official position, desires to find a <b>well-to-do, kind-hearted, and
lonely gentleman</b>, to whom he could be a true life-companion, and to
whom, until the end of his life, he would give true affection. He
would faithfully fulfil all his
<span class="nowrap">duties.<a id="FNanchor774"></a><a href="#Footnote774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></span></p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The numerous advertisements, also, in which young girls and
women, or widows, desire &#8220;positions&#8221; as housekeepers, companions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page725">[725]</span>
etc., in the houses of &#8220;well-to-do&#8221; gentlemen &#8220;living
alone&#8221; have, as a rule, an immoral basis.</p>

<p>3. <b>Advertisements regarding Correspondence.</b>&mdash;These also form
a permanent constituent of the advertisements of the daily
papers, and serve in part the aims of prostitution or of assignations
for sexual intercourse, but in part really aim at an exchange of
more or less erotic letters, as is obviously the case in respect of
the following advertisements:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>Young cultured man desires a stimulating (!) correspondence with
a young lady.</p>

<p>Young lady desires to enter into correspondence with a lady of good
position, with similar ideas.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>4. <b>Advertisements of Rooms.</b>&mdash;Among these advertisements,
we find that of the &#8220;convenient room&#8221; or the room &#8220;with a
separate entrance&#8221;&mdash;the &#8220;storm-free diggings&#8221; of the student.
Such rooms are usually offered to men; women must seek them
for themselves, as in the following advertisement:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A lady artist desires a well-furnished convenient room, with bath-room
and piano, as an only tenant.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>The advertisements regarding rooms to be let &#8220;during the
day&#8221; mostly refer to opportunities for fornication (&#8220;houses of
accommodation&#8221;).</p>

<p>5. <b>Pseudo-Educational Advertisements.</b>&mdash;Here also there is a
form of advertisement which enables us without difficulty to
recognize their true purpose&mdash;for example:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A young Englishwoman gives stimulating instruction.</p>

<p><b>Jeune</b> Fran&ccedil;aise, <b>gaie</b> (!), bien recomm. qui enseigne de m&eacute;thode
facile et rapide, donne des l&eacute;&ccedil;ons.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Very frequent are announcements of sadistic or masochistic
&#8220;instruction,&#8221; in which the &#8220;energy&#8221; or &#8220;imposing appearance&#8221;
of the instructor or instructress is emphasized, or in which the
word &#8220;discipline&#8221; is displayed in a significance which cannot be
misunderstood.</p>

<p>6. <b>Rendezvous and Postilion d&#8217;Amour Advertisements.</b>&mdash;These
subserve the appointment of lovers, often adulterous lovers;
but also the opening up of acquaintanceship. Examples:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="center highline2"><b>Veronika.</b></p>

<p>To-day unfortunately prevented, therefore 21st.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><b>&#8220;Wireless Telegraphy.&#8221;</b></p>

<p>Best thanks for dear letter. Drive to-day. A thousand kisses.&mdash;L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page726">[726]</span></p>

<p class="center highline2"><b>&#8220;Good Report.&#8221;</b></p>

<p>A letter will be found addressed to &#8220;Sophie G.,&#8221; post restante,
Vienna, I/1, principal post-office.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><b>M.S.A.</b></p>

<p>To-day, 4. Please bring news. Most intimate.&mdash;K. D. D.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><b>A. 15.</b></p>

<p>Je n&#8217;oublie pas et j&#8217;esp&egrave;re.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Very frequent also are requests from male advertisers, addressed
to ladies they have chanced to meet in the railway, electric
tram, etc., asking where the latter may live. These advertisements
give a description of the appearance, costume, time, and
place of the first meeting, and beg the lady to give her address
&#8220;in confidence,&#8221; or to come to some specified place of meeting.
A very large number of <b>letters addressed post restante</b> are of an
erotic nature, and belong to this category.</p>

<p>7. <b>Private Inquiries.</b>&mdash;Under this heading persons advertise
in the newspapers that for an honorarium (usually a very high
one) they will undertake to watch secretly any desired person&mdash;and
almost invariably such watching relates to the sexual life
and activity of the person under observation; when employed,
they use all the methods of the most unscrupulous detective.
These individuals play a principal part in divorce proceedings,
and in conjugal quarrel based upon jealousy; they are a
cancer of our <span class="nowrap">time<a id="FNanchor775"></a><a href="#Footnote775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></span>
which cannot be too energetically suppressed.
A detective advertisement of this character is the following:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="center highline2"><b>Private Inquiry.</b></p>

<p>Confidential! Enlightening! Unfailing! Truthful! Universal!
Extraordinarily satisfactory conjugal inquiries; mode of life, family
relationships, liaisons, peculiarities of character, occupations, present
condition, past misconduct, future prospects, state of property, secret
intercourse, etc., etc.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>8. <b>Advertisements relating to Sexual Perversions.</b>&mdash;We have
already referred to homosexual advertisements. An even
more important part is played by <b>sadistic</b> and <b>masochistic</b>
advertisements, which usually appear under the cloak of<span class="pagenum" id="Page727">[727]</span>
&#8220;massage,&#8221; &#8220;instruction,&#8221; or of an &#8220;energetic&#8221; person.
Examples:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p><b>Masoch.</b> Who is interested in this matter? Address &#8220;Kismet,&#8221;
office of this paper.</p>

<p>Widow of noble birth, middle-aged, <b>energetic</b>, desires position in
the house of a gentleman of standing, as reader, or in some other
capacity.</p>

<p>Cabinet de massage, par dame dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;e, hydroth&eacute;rapie. Mme. D.,
82, Rue Blanche.</p>

<p>Massage su&eacute;dois, par dame dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;e, tous les jours de 10 &agrave; 8 heures.</p>

<p>Madame Martinet, le&ccedil;ons de maintien....</p>

<p>Monsieur d&eacute;s. gouvernante gr. et forte, 40 a. <b>s&eacute;v&egrave;re</b> pour educ.
enfant diffic. A. B. p.r. Amiens.</p>

<p><b>Energetic</b> distinguished lady, in temporary need, wishes to receive
a considerable loan, but will meet only the actual lender.</p>

<p>Severin is seeking his Wanda!</p>

<p>A young man begs 30 marks from a lady. &#8220;Sacher Masoch,&#8221; Post
Office, K&ouml;penickerstrasse.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>Even fetichistic advertisements sometimes appear, such as the
following, from a shoe fetichist:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>A young man of means buys for his private collection elegant shoes,
which have been worn by leading actresses, or by ladies of high rank.</p>

</div>

<p>9. <b>Handbills.</b>&mdash;In large towns these are distributed by persons
standing at the street corners, and usually relate to restaurants
with women attendants. One example will suffice:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p class="center highline2"><b>The Restaurant of the Good-Natured Saxon Girl.</b></p>

<p>The attendants at this restaurant are young and pretty girls from
Saxony; Miss Elly waits at the bar. Piano-playing and singing.
Your kind patronage is requested by <b>The Young Hostess</b>.</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>&#8220;Chiromantists,&#8221; magnetopaths, and other charlatans, advertise
themselves by means of street handbills. In the Latin countries,
and more especially in Paris, true &#8220;<b>brothel guides</b>&#8221; stand at the
street corners, and conduct the passers-by to improper dramatic
representations, or provide for them children for fornicatory
purpose, or invite them to homosexual intercourse, etc.</p>

<p>The third form under which the sexual life makes a public
appearance is that of the great scandals and sensational occurrences
with a sexual background, which are discussed by the
press. I allude here, without attempting completeness, to
<b>murders</b> and <b>suicides</b> arising from jealousy, from rejected love,
or from love unsuccessful for some other reason&mdash;occurrences
which afford sufficient proof that individual <b>falling in love</b> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page728">[728]</span>
our own time is just as violent and passionate as it was formerly;
further, to <b>abduction</b> and <b>seduction</b>; to <b>divorce scandals</b> and
<b>divorce proceedings</b>; in general, to all <b>law-court proceedings
relating to sexual offences</b>; to <b>duels</b> dependent upon erotic
motives; to <b>family tragedies</b> upon a similar basis; to the great
<b>procuress trials</b>; to the discovery of <b>secret sexual clubs</b> and of
<b>erotic orgies</b>; to <b>revelations from nunneries and from secular institutions</b>;
to the exploits of <b>swindlers</b>, who very frequently make
use of sexual passion in others to assist them in their pursuit
of plunder, etc. Examples of all these varieties of scandals
and sensational occurrences are found day by day in the newspapers.
Very frequently, on account of the very nature of sexual
psychology, they exercise a suggestive influence, so that we often
hear of similar occurrences at brief intervals. If we assume
the existence of psychical contagion, there is no doubt that these
sensational newspaper reports play a far greater part therein
than the <b>whole</b> of the so-called erotic literature.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>

<p class="noindent">What is an obscene, pornographic book or picture? In order to
obtain an accurate and objective definition of this idea, we must
always keep clearly before our minds the distinction between
&#8220;<b>pornography</b>&#8221; and &#8220;<b>eroticism</b>.&#8221; The confusion between these
two ideas explains the great conflict of opinion on the part of
expert witnesses in connexion with the question whether any
specified book or picture is to be regarded as &#8220;immoral&#8221; or
&#8220;indecent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The obscene differs <i>toto c&#339;lo</i> from the erotic. In my own
possession is a rare work which is probably the first monograph
regarding obscene books. It dates from the year 1688, and is
the thesis of a Leipzig <span class="nowrap">doctor.<a id="FNanchor776"></a><a href="#Footnote776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></span>
At that time it was still possible
to compose <b>academic</b> essays upon such topics. To-day this
would only be possible in the legal faculty and from the criminal
standpoint. In respect of the unprejudiced scientific and historical
consideration of pornography, we have experienced a
notable retrogression, and at the present day a certain degree of
courage is needed to make these things an object of scientific
study, to consider in an unprejudiced and objective manner
these peculiar outgrowths of the human soul.</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned essay the learned writer gives, on
p. 5, a definition of the obscene, which shows that he had not
thoroughly differentiated it from the erotic, but confused the
two ideas under the same term. In his view, obscene writings
are &#8220;all such writings whose authors use distinctly improper
language, and speak plainly about the sexual organs, or describe
the shameless acts of voluptuous and impure human beings, in
such words that chaste and tender ears would shudder to hear
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But such improper descriptions might occur in a work without
its being possible to designate this as obscene. <b>A book can
justly be called obscene only when it has been composed simply,
solely, and exclusively for the purpose of producing sexual excitement</b>&mdash;when
its contents aim at inducing in its readers a condition
of coarse and brutish sensuality.</p>

<p>This definition clearly excludes all those literary products
which, notwithstanding the existence of isolated erotic, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page732">[732]</span>
even obscene, passages, <b>are yet composed for purposes radically
different from that above described</b>&mdash;it excludes, for example,
artistic, religious, and scientific works (the history of civilization,
poetry, belles-lettres, medicine, folk-lore, etc.).</p>

<p>The question, namely, whether <b>simple sexual relationships</b> can
properly be made the object of <b>artistic</b> or <b>scientific</b> representation,
may be answered with an unconditional affirmative, if we presuppose
a purely artistic or scientific critical representation and
consideration of erotic objects; that is to say, in the work of
art, or the scientific work, as the case may be, the purely sexual
must completely disappear behind the higher artistic or scientific
conception. This is possible only when that which is
represented is <b>completely devoid of actuality</b>; when time and
place are entirely ignored, so that the object is regarded rather
from its <b>general human</b> aspect; and when, further, in the artistic
representation of the purely sexual we find expression also, on
the part of the artist, of a conception enlightening and to a degree
<b>overcoming</b> the purely physical; or when, finally, on the part
of the man of science, we recognize a critical point of view, by
means of which the <b>causal</b> relationships of the sexual find
expression.</p>

<p>The <b>general tendency</b> is determinative, not the shocking individual
detail. I need not waste any more words upon the
importance of medical, ethnological, psychological, and historical
works upon the sexual <span class="nowrap">life.<a id="FNanchor777"></a><a href="#Footnote777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></span>
This fact is, fortunately,
now fully recognized even by the greatest morality fanatics, and
it would hardly now be possible in Germany that a law-court&mdash;as
recently in <span class="nowrap">Belgium<a id="FNanchor778"></a><a href="#Footnote778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></span>&mdash;should
witness proceedings against a
medical undertaking on account of pornographic (!)
<span class="nowrap">illustrations.<a id="FNanchor779"></a><a href="#Footnote779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></span></p>

<p>The same is true of the artistic consideration of sexual matters.
For example, how readily everything sexual lends itself to the
<b>humorous</b> point of view! How short here is the step from the
sublime to the ridiculous! In a copy which lies before me of
Fr. Th. Vischers&#8217; first work, &#8220;The Sublime and the Ridiculous&#8221;
(Stuttgart, 1837), which was once in the possession of a friend of
Goethe, the Driburg physician, Anton Theobald Br&uuml;ck, we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page733">[733]</span>
on p. 203, in his handwriting, the apt marginal note: &#8220;Wit gilds
the nickel of the obscene.&#8221; Sexual matters actually provoke
humour. This fact was enunciated by Schopenhauer, and was
ascribed by him to the profound earnestness which underlies the
sexual (&#8220;Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,&#8221; i., 330). For this
reason, as Eduard <span class="nowrap">Fuchs<a id="FNanchor780"></a><a href="#Footnote780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></span>
rightly insists, the majority of all
erotic creations are of the nature of caricatures. The most
brilliant advocate of this humorous view of sexual matters is
the brilliant English artist Thomas Rowlandson, whose works,
both in England and in Germany, have long been kept under
lock and key.</p>

<p>The <b>mystic-satanic</b> element in the sexual also stimulates
artistic representations, and in the works of Baudelaire, Barbey
d&#8217;Aurevilly, F&eacute;licien Rops, Aubrey Beardsley, Toulouse Lautrec,
etc., we see that the &#8220;perverse&#8221; also is thoroughly capable of
erotic representation. But even pure obscenity, without any
underlying idea&mdash;as, for example, we see it to-day in the obscene
drawings of Carracci&mdash;may have the effect of a simple artistic
product, if the taste of the onlooker is so far matured that the
purely sexual can recede completely behind the artistic conception.
We must, generally speaking, not fail to take into account the
individuality and the age of the spectator or reader. For <b>children</b>
and <b>immature</b> persons, even works that are obviously <b>not obscene</b>,
such as artistic, religious, and scientific literature, may, in certain
circumstances, be dangerous&mdash;works which adults regard and
judge in the spirit of their own time, as, for example, the <b>Bible</b>
and the writings of the <b>Fathers of the Church</b>. John Milton, who
was certainly not lacking in piety, wrote: &#8220;The Bible often
relates <b>blasphemies</b> in no very delicate manner; it describes the
<b>fleshly lusts of vicious men</b> not without
<span class="nowrap">elegance.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor781"></a><a href="#Footnote781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></span> <b>Books
which are to be read by children</b> cannot be chosen too carefully,
for a very large proportion also of the literature which is not,
properly speaking, obscene, but which deals with sexual matters,
has <b>upon the childish imagination</b> an effect equivalent to that of
true pornography upon the adult.</p>

<p>In passing judgment on an erotic work, we must, finally, take
into consideration the <b>standard of the epoch</b> to which the work
belongs; we must bear in mind the nature of the <b>contemporary
moral ideas</b>. Much which to us to-day appears obscene was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page734">[734]</span>
so in the middle ages. On the other hand, we must not excuse
everything on this plea, for our forefathers were also familiar
with pornographic and utterly obscene books. Works such as
those of the Marquis de Sade or of Nicolas Chorier (&#8220;Gespr&auml;che
der Aloysia Sigaea&#8221;) have not only an importance in the history
of civilization: they also have an interest for anthropologists
and medical men. They constitute remarkable documents of
the nature and mode of manifestation of sexual perversities in
earlier times. Moreover, all pornographic writings afford us valuable
assistance in our study of the genesis of sexual perversions.
But while we admit the importance of such writings&mdash;for example,
those of de Sade&mdash;to learned men and bibliophiles, we cannot
condemn in sufficiently strong terms the insane undertaking of
translating de Sade&#8217;s books in our own day. This is simply
pornology; for all those who, as medical men, psychologists,
or historians of civilization, are occupied with pornographic
literature, are&mdash;or, at any rate, should be&mdash;competent to read
these authors in the original <span class="nowrap">tongue.<a id="FNanchor782"></a><a href="#Footnote782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></span>
I feel therefore that the
mass of recently published German translations of the pornographic
writings of John Cleland, Mirabeau, Nerciat, de Sade,
of the &#8220;Antijustine&#8221; of R&eacute;tif de la Bretonne, of the &#8220;Portier
des Chartreux,&#8221; of Alfred de Musset&#8217;s &#8220;Gamiani,&#8221; etc., can
only be described as pornography, although I must admit that
the original editions are often inaccessible to the scientific student
interested in the matter, who in such cases must, <i>faute de mieux</i>,
content himself with translations.</p>

<p>These obscene writings may be compared with <b>natural poisons,
which must also be carefully studied</b>, but which can be entrusted
<b>only to those</b> who are fully acquainted with their dangerous
effects, who know how to control and counteract these effects,
and who regard them as an object of natural research by means
of which they will be enabled to obtain an understanding of
other phenomena.</p>

<p>The pornographic element of literature and
<span class="nowrap">art<a id="FNanchor783"></a><a href="#Footnote783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></span>
has an ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page735">[735]</span>
history. In Greece, Rome, and Egypt, but more especially in
India, Japan, and China, there existed an extensive obscene
literature. In Europe the <b>French</b>, <b>Italian</b>, and <b>English</b> obscene
literature occupies the first place as regards comprehensiveness
and wide diffusion. Exceptionally dangerous in their effect are
French pornographic writings, because their mode of expression
is so elegant, whereas the English obscene books, with the single
exception of Cleland&#8217;s &#8220;Fanny Hill,&#8221; are positively deterrent,
on account of the coarse phraseology employed in them. The
German writings in this department are not much better
than the English, and consist to a large extent of bad translations
of foreign pornographic works&mdash;if we except a few older
writings, which are repeatedly reissued, such as the &#8220;Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten
des Herrn von H.,&#8221; by Schilling, or the &#8220;Memoiren
einer S&auml;ngerin,&#8221; the first part of which is ascribed to the
celebrated Wilhelmine Schr&ouml;der-Devrient. Speaking generally,
it is a remarkable phenomenon (and one which is in flat
contradiction to the assertion so frequently made that pornography
and true art cannot possibly be associated) that so
many spirits of the first rank, great artists either in literature
or plastic art, have enriched pornography themselves by works
of their own, or, failing this, have at least been notorious lovers
of pornography. This fact was clearly manifested at the time
of the Italian renascence, but it can be traced down to the present
day. Men like Voltaire (&#8220;La Pucelle d&#8217;Orl&eacute;ans&#8221;), Mirabeau
(&#8220;L&#8217;&Eacute;ducation de Laure,&#8221; &#8220;Ma Conversion,&#8221; etc.), Alfred
de Musset (&#8220;Gamiani&#8221;), Guy de Maupassant (&#8220;Les Cousines
de la Colonelle&#8221;), Th&eacute;ophile Gautier (&#8220;Lettre &agrave; la Pr&eacute;sidente&#8221;),
and Gustave Droz (&#8220;Un &Eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; la Campagne&#8221;), have written
indubitably pornographic books. But the heroes of our own
German literature have not been free from such tendencies.
Goethe not only wrote the &#8220;Tagebuch,&#8221; but composed other (<b>still
completely unknown</b>) erotica, which, by command of the Grand
Duchess Sophie, were sealed and hidden
<span class="nowrap">away.<a id="FNanchor784"></a><a href="#Footnote784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></span>
Schopenhauer,<a id="FNanchor785"></a><a href="#Footnote785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page736">[736]</span>
who said to Frauenst&auml;dt that a philosopher must be active,
&#8220;not only with his head, but also with his genital organs,&#8221;
was a lover of pornography, even of a skatological character, and
was fond of telling &#8220;bawdy stories which will not bear repetition&#8221;&mdash;for
example, he would enumerate the different kinds of
kissing, describe the varieties of the sexual impulse,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a id="FNanchor786"></a><a href="#Footnote786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></span> Schiller
and Goethe enjoyed reading Diderot&#8217;s &#8220;The Nun&#8221; (&#8220;La Religieuse&#8221;)
and his &#8220;Bijoux Indiscrets,&#8221; R&eacute;tif&#8217;s &#8220;Monsieur
Nicolas,&#8221; and the &#8220;Liaisons Dangereuses&#8221; of Choderlos de
Laclos, books which would nowadays be suppressed as &#8220;immoral.&#8221;
Lichtenberg also was a very zealous reader, and a
connoisseur, not only of erotic, but also of pornographic literature.
In his letters he alludes to reading such pornographic
works as Cleland&#8217;s &#8220;Woman of Pleasure&#8221; (&#8220;Letters,&#8221; edition
Leitzmann and Sch&uuml;ddekopf, vol. ii., p. 187) and &#8220;Lyndamine,&#8221;
etc. Talented women of that period also read pornographic
works. Pauline Wiesel, the beloved of Prince Louis Ferdinand
of Prussia, greatly admired Mirabeau&#8217;s obscene writings, as we
learn from a letter of Friedrich Gentz, in which the latter decries
them as &#8220;cold libertinage,&#8221; and recommends to his friend similar
products of Voltaire, Cr&eacute;billon, and
<span class="nowrap">Gr&eacute;court.<a id="FNanchor787"></a><a href="#Footnote787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></span></p>

<p>These facts do not excuse pornography, but they refute the
assertion that pornography and true artistic perception are incompatible.
As Schopenhauer truly says, many contrasts can
exist side by side in the same human being. This is even more
clearly manifest in pictorial art. Anyone who turns over the
leaves of Eduard Fuchs&#8217; book upon the erotic element in caricature
will learn that the greatest painters have occasionally
painted deliberately <b>improper, obscene</b> pictures. I need mention
only the names of Lucas Cranach, Annibale Carracci, H. S. Beham,
Rembrandt, G. Aldegrever, Adrian van Ostade, Watteau,
Boucher, Fragonard, Vivan-Denon, Gillray, Lawrence, Rowlandson,
Heinrich Ramberg, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Schadow,
Otto Greiner, Willette, Kubin, Julius
<span class="nowrap">Pascin,<a id="FNanchor788"></a><a href="#Footnote788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></span> Beardsley,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a id="FNanchor789"></a><a href="#Footnote789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></span></p>

<p>Side by side with these higher pornographic works there exists
also a lower kind&mdash;obscene garbage writings and pornographic<span class="pagenum" id="Page737">[737]</span>
pictures of the worst possible kind, such as picture postcards,
&#8220;act-photographs,&#8221; etc., in which all possible sexual perversities
are represented, either in printed matter or by pictures (masturbation,
<i>poses lubriques</i>, representations of nude portions of
the body, copralagnistic and urolagnistic acts, bestiality, sadism,
masochism, p&aelig;derasty, incest, fornicatory acts with children,
orgies, obscene paraphrases of proverbs, rape, etc.). Kemmer
(<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 31-45) gives a detailed account of the sale of these
obscenities, and of the way in which they are advertised in
catalogues, etc. They are manufactured in France, Germany,
Belgium, and Spain (especially in Barcelona). The dangerous
character of these articles is indisputable; they have a suggestive
influence, and stimulate those who look at them to imitative
acts. They may thus directly give rise to sexual
<span class="nowrap">perversities.<a id="FNanchor790"></a><a href="#Footnote790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></span>
But they are not so dangerous as the true <b>hawkers&#8217;</b>
<span class="nowrap"><b>literature</b><a id="FNanchor791"></a><a href="#Footnote791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></span>
and <b>popular garbage writings</b> about &#8220;secret sins.&#8221;
These inflame the imagination, and thus lead to crime and
sexual infamies. This is an old experience. In the year 1901,
at the trial of the boy murderers Th&auml;rigen and Kroft (<i>Vossische
Zeitung</i>, No. 161, April 5, 1901), the two murderers confessed
that they had been incited to the commission of crime by backstairs
romances, and by tales of Indians and robbers. The same
cause was alleged, in December, 1906, in Kottbus, by a boy
fourteen years of age, who was accused of murder.</p>

<p>How are we to counteract the moral harm done by such literature?
I consider all the efforts of societies for the suppression
of immorality to be illusory and two-edged, for they <b>always fail</b>
to attain their end; and in addition, unfortunately&mdash;a matter of
which there is no doubt&mdash;they endanger the freedom of art and
<span class="nowrap">science.<a id="FNanchor792"></a><a href="#Footnote792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></span>
All measures calculated to keep away from children<span class="pagenum" id="Page738">[738]</span>
and immature persons books which might serve to give rise
to sexual stimulation are worthy of support; and it must be
remembered that <b>for children and immature persons scientific
books, religious writings&mdash;as, for example, the unexpurgated Bible&mdash;and
also illustrated comic papers, etc., may be dangerous</b>. But,
for the most part, all prohibitions, and the whole campaign against
immorality, <b>serve only to favour pornography</b>. The stricter the
measures taken against it, <b>the wider becomes its diffusion</b>. This is
a <b>very old experience</b>, an incontrovertible fact. Tacitus (&#8220;Ann.,&#8221;
XIV., c. 50) rightly explained this peculiar phenomenon: &#8220;<i>Libros
exuri jussit</i>, <b>conquisitos lectitatosque, donec cum periculo parabantur</b>:
<i>mox licentia habendi oblivionem attulit</i>&#8221; (&#8220;He issued a
decree that the books were to be burned; <b>but as long as it was
dangerous to publish them they were in great request, and were
eagerly read</b>: whereas as soon as people were permitted to possess
them they passed into oblivion&#8221;). The pornographic books
which during the last five hundred years have been burned by
the public executioner, which have been confiscated, and which
have been repeatedly destroyed to the last copy, the obscene
engravings of which the plates have been destroyed&mdash;have all
these disappeared from the surface of the earth, have all these
confiscations and <span class="nowrap">condemnations<a id="FNanchor793"></a><a href="#Footnote793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></span>
of <i>livres d&eacute;fendus</i> been of any
use whatever? No. All the pornographic writings, confiscated
and destroyed a thousand times over, <b>reappear again and again</b>;
indeed, they become more numerous the more the attempt is
made to suppress them. The campaign against them has always
been a campaign against a hydra, a labour of the Dana&iuml;des,<span class="pagenum" id="Page739">[739]</span>
which has no object, and only entails the disadvantage that, in
the general zeal to put an end to immoral literature, scientific
and artistic interests are most seriously endangered. Happily,
this campaign is to-day less vigorous than it was of yore. In
proportion to the population, immoral literature in Germany was
before 1870 far more widely diffused than it is at the present
day. During the sixth and seventh decades of the nineteenth
century it flourished more luxuriantly; even during the time of
the war of liberation numerous original obscene books were
printed in Germany. To-day the interest in social, scientific,
technical, and philosophic questions, and in sport, has become
so great, and the interest in sexual questions has become so much
<b>more profound</b>, that an overgrowth of pornography is no longer
to be feared. From these facts we recognize at once <b>the only
way</b>, and <b>the right way</b>, which we must follow in order to paralyze
the evil influences of pornography. This is to take a proper
care for <b>genuine popular culture, to increase educational opportunities</b>,
and to <b>reduce the price of books</b>. A single undertaking

publishes for threepence a volume a collection of choice literature,
containing not only the best fiction, but also popularly
written scientific works from the pens of leading men of science
and essayists&mdash;such an enterprise is far more effective in the

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is a familiar fact that from the very earliest uprising of belletristic
literature its nucleus has always been the passion of love.
There are, indeed, very few recent romances or dramas in which
love does not play a part. It is a fable to say that sexual matters
have <b>to-day for the first time</b> been freely discussed in belletristic
literature, to assert that the predominance of erotic literature
(which is to be distinguished from pornographic literature by its
artistic intention and form) is especially characteristic of modern
civilization. A glance at the catalogue of the library of the
poet and bibliophile Eduard
<span class="nowrap">Grisebach,<a id="FNanchor794"></a><a href="#Footnote794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></span> which contains the
erotic literature of the world, teaches us that such literature
has existed at all times and among all civilized nations. The
erotic in belles-lettres has not merely a permissive existence, but
by necessity forms a part of it&mdash;a fact very justly recognized
by the &aelig;sthetic Konrad
<span class="nowrap">Lange.<a id="FNanchor795"></a><a href="#Footnote795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></span> Who that knows human
nature can doubt the fact? Lange remarks:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Art which represents the nude, because an opportunity exists for
it to delight in the representation of the flesh, because it regards
humanity as the crown of creation, and because it admires the purposive
anatomical structure of the human body&mdash;such an art is <b>within
its own rights</b>, and does what it <b>may</b> and <b>must</b>.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we regard the representation of the nude in painting and
sculpture as not repulsive, although it does not suit us in ordinary life
to go naked, <b>so also in the poesy of the erotic we must sometimes
allow a form to which in ordinary life a justification is refused</b>.
Indeed, the question arises whether it is not absolutely <b>essential</b> that
art should represent the erotic, although this is forbidden by the
civilization of our time; for this corresponds to a profound subjective
human need, a yearning for the completion of man&#8217;s imperfect
existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next to hunger and thirst, love is the strongest human emotion;
next to death, its enjoyment is the most important human experience.
It is not to be wondered at that art is especially fond of depicting it.
Art which wishes to represent life in general cannot leave unconsidered
an instinct which plays so important a part in the life of the majority
of human beings, and from which such a number of conflicts proceed.
With regard to the degree and the kind of representation, <b>the decision
depends not upon moral, but exclusively upon &aelig;sthetic, considerations</b>.
The task of the poet is no more than this: to describe transgressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page744">[744]</span>
of the moral code in such a manner that they appear to arise by an
inner necessity out of the whole course of activity, out of the characters,
out of the objective relationships. Then the immoral content
comes to the help of the illusion.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--textquote-->

<p>It is naturally impossible, within the narrow compass of this
work, to give an exhaustive account of the sexual element in
modern belletristic literature. I shall only refer to a few well-known
phenomena which all exhibit a common feature. Love
and sexual topics in belles-lettres are principally <b>problem</b> literature.
The earnest and profound social perception with which
sexual problems are to-day considered and explained is reflected
also in the literature of our time. The adult will long ago in these
matters have risen above the level of shallow story-telling and
schoolgirl morality, and demands an earnest and honest representation
of sexual problems. <span class="nowrap">Frey<a id="FNanchor796"></a><a href="#Footnote796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></span>
justly observes that it is
a general and a healthy tendency of the time, not a tendency
to perverse lust, which impels the choice of erotic material. In
the economically determined forced labour of persons of average
ability, in the monotony and the poverty of adventure of our
civilized life, it is only by eroticism that into many a life any
individual colouring is brought.</p>

<p>In the following brief sketch of the sexual problems treated
in recent belletristic literature, I hope to give some idea of the
<b>very numerous</b> and interesting topics which the various phenomena
of the sexual life now offer to the poet.</p>

<p>The very <b>first</b> sexual activities of the child have been subjected
to poetic treatment, as in Frank Wedekind&#8217;s drama, &#8220;Fr&uuml;hlingserwachen&#8221;
(&#8220;The Awakening of Spring&#8221;); and the sexual note
of the time of puberty is treated in Bonnetain&#8217;s celebrated
onanistic novel, &#8220;Charlot s&#8217;Amuse,&#8221; in Walter Bloem&#8217;s novel,
&#8220;Der krasse Fuchs,&#8221; in Max von M&uuml;nchhausen&#8217;s &#8220;Eckhart von
Jeperen,&#8221; and very strikingly in the novel &#8220;Lothar oder Untergang
einer Kindheit&#8221; (&#8220;Lothar, or the Ruin of Childhood&#8221;),
by Oscar A. H. Schmitz. In connexion with the consideration
of the time of puberty in belletristic literature, the following
works may also be mentioned: &#8220;Unterm Rad,&#8221; by Hermann
Hesse; &#8220;Freund Hein,&#8221; by Emil Strauss; &#8220;Die Verwirrungen
des Z&ouml;glings T&ouml;rless,&#8221; by Robert Musil; &#8220;Was zur Sonne Will,&#8221;
by Hans Hart; &#8220;Eine Gymnasiastentrag&ouml;die,&#8221; a drama in four
acts, by Robert Sandeks. Consult also Gustav Zieler&#8217;s review of
&#8220;Fr&uuml;hlingserwachen,&#8221; published in <i>Das Literarische Echo</i> of
August 15, 1907.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page745">[745]</span></p>

<p>The type of girl who ripens to a premature sexuality, and
who, though physically still intact, is spiritually corrupt, has
been made widely known by Marcel Pr&eacute;vost&#8217;s &#8220;Demivierge.&#8221; A
companion novel to this is &#8220;Nixchen,&#8221; by Hans von Kahlenberg.
Nobler types of girls playing with this vice are described by
Clara Eysell-Kilburger in &#8220;Dilettanten des Lasters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diametrically opposed to these are the &#8220;Vera&#8221; characters,
so called after the book by Vera, &#8220;Eine f&uuml;r Viele. Aus dem
Tagebuche eines M&auml;dchens&#8221; (&#8220;One for Many. From the Diary
of a Girl&#8221;), which demands from the man before marriage the
same purity and chastity that man himself demands from his
future wife. Svava, in Bj&ouml;rnsen&#8217;s drama &#8220;Der Handschuh,&#8221; is
a similar type. Regarding this problem an entire literature has
sprung into being, which associated itself with Vera&#8217;s above-mentioned
book, such as &#8220;Eine f&uuml;r sich Selbst&#8221; (&#8220;One
for Herself&#8221;), by &#8220;Auch Jemand&#8221; (&#8220;Somebody Else&#8221;);
&#8220;Einer f&uuml;r Viele&#8221; (&#8220;One Man for Many&#8221;); &#8220;Eine f&uuml;r Vera.
Aus dem Tagebuche einer jungen Frau&#8221; (&#8220;One for Vera. From
the Diary of a Young Wife&#8221;)&mdash;these in favour of Vera&#8217;s demand&mdash;and
Christine Thaler&#8217;s &#8220;Eine Mutter f&uuml;r Viele&#8221; (&#8220;One Mother
for Many&#8221;); by Verus, &#8220;Einer f&uuml;r Viele&#8221; (&#8220;One Man for
Many&#8221;), and &#8220;Kranke Seelen. Von einem Arzte&#8221; (&#8220;Morbid
Souls. By a Physician&#8221;)&mdash;these in opposition to Vera&#8217;s demand&mdash;for
masculine abstinence from sexual intercourse before
<span class="nowrap">marriage.<a id="FNanchor797"></a><a href="#Footnote797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></span></p>

<p>Next we may mention certain novels glorifying <b>misogyny</b>, such
as Strindberg&#8217;s &#8220;Beichte eines Toren&#8221; (&#8220;Confessions of a
Fool&#8221;) and &#8220;Vergangenheit eines Toren&#8221; (&#8220;The Past of a
Fool&#8221;); and Tolstoi&#8217;s &#8220;The Kreutzer Sonata,&#8221; in which absolute
asceticism is demanded. These ideas, which in Weininger found
a pseudo-scientific apologist, have been contested in an interesting
autobiography in the form of a romance, &#8220;Das Weib vom
Manne erschaffen: Bekenntnisse einer Frau&#8221; (&#8220;Woman created
from Man: Confessions of a Woman&#8221;), translated from the
Norwegian by Tyra Bentsen. Zola&#8217;s magnificent hymn in favour
of fruitfulness in &#8220;F&eacute;condit&eacute;&#8221; is also a refutation of this extreme
ascetic-malthusian standpoint.</p>

<p>The &#8220;intimacy&#8221; and &#8220;free love&#8221; are to-day the subject of
innumerable romances and novels. Tovote discusses the problem<span class="pagenum" id="Page746">[746]</span>
in &#8220;Im Liebesrausch&#8221; (&#8220;In the Intoxication of Love&#8221;), and in
other novels, more superficially from the grossly sensual side;
the ideal free love, ending indeed in marriage, is described in
Peter Nansen&#8217;s
<span class="nowrap">&#8220;Maria.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor798"></a><a href="#Footnote798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></span>
Similarly, Frenssen, in &#8220;Hilligenlei,&#8221;
deals with the preconjugal sexual intercourse so common
in country districts, and he reproves in powerful words the
repression of natural impulses by conventional
<span class="nowrap">morality.<a id="FNanchor799"></a><a href="#Footnote799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></span></p>

<p>In &#8220;Martin Birks Jugend,&#8221; Hjalmar S&ouml;derberg has described
the great difficulties of ideal-minded young men who are not in
a position to marry, and who are repelled by the idea of intercourse
with common prostitutes.</p>

<p>In contrast to this, Camille Lemonnier, in &#8220;Die Liebe im
Menschen,&#8221; describes the great danger of an <b>overgrowth</b> of the
sexual; and Arthur Schnitzler, in his admirable &#8220;Reigen,&#8221;
describes the utter misery of <b>irregular sexual intercourse</b>, of true
&#8220;wild love,&#8221; and displays vividly before our eyes the results
of sexual promiscuity.</p>

<p>The social contempt and the other disastrous consequences
which to-day follow free love, in the form of <b>illegitimate motherhood</b>,
have been described in dramas, such as Sudermann&#8217;s
&#8220;Heimat&#8221; and Gerhart Hauptmann&#8217;s &#8220;Rose Bernd,&#8221; and in
romances such as Gabriele Reuter&#8217;s &#8220;Aus guter Familie,&#8221; Johann<span class="pagenum" id="Page747">[747]</span>
Bojer&#8217;s &#8220;Eine Pilgerfahrt,&#8221; and Ernst Eberhardt&#8217;s &#8220;Das Kind.&#8221;
The manifold conflicts resulting from free love and illegitimate
motherhood are also described by Marcelle Tinayre in &#8220;La
Rebelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>In belles-lettres we also find numerous accounts of the burning
question of our day&mdash;that of <b>coercive marriage</b>. Above all,
Ibsen, in &#8220;Ghosts,&#8221; &#8220;A Doll&#8217;s House,&#8221; &#8220;The Lady from the
Sea,&#8221; &#8220;Hedda Gabler,&#8221; and &#8220;Little Eyolf,&#8221; has exposed the
manifold injuries resulting from modern conventional marriage,
and has propounded the ideal of a new marriage, based upon a
deeply subjective conception of love and upon life&#8217;s work in
common. The influence of Ibsen is further shown in numerous
dramas and romances dealing with the marriage problem. Of
these, it will suffice to mention a few of the most successful, such
as &#8220;Die Sklavin,&#8221; by Ludwig Fulda; &#8220;Fanny Roth: eine Jungfrauengeschichte,&#8221;
by Grete Meisel-Hess; and &#8220;Was siehst du
aber den Splitter,&#8221; by Karl Larsen.</p>

<p>The important question of differences in class and social
position in married life is considered by Ernst von Wildenbruch
in his drama, &#8220;Die Haubenlerche.&#8221;</p>

<p>The classical novels of adultery are, and will remain, Erneste
Feydeau&#8217;s delightful &#8220;Fanny,&#8221; and Gustave Flaubert&#8217;s &#8220;Madame
Bovary.&#8221; In French literature in general, in dramas as well as
romances, adultery is a favourite
<span class="nowrap">motive.<a id="FNanchor800"></a><a href="#Footnote800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></span></p>

<p>Isolated but especially characteristic phenomena of the sexual
life have also found expression in poetry. Thus Ernst von
Wolzogen, in &#8220;Das Dritte Geschlect,&#8221; describes the various types
of <b>emancipated women</b>; the same question forms the theme of
&#8220;Die Neue Eva,&#8221; by Maria Janitschek. Anna Mahr, also, in
Gerhart Hauptmann&#8217;s &#8220;Einsame Menschen,&#8221; is such a type.
In all of these the conflict between woman and personality is
described; and this is done with exceptional force and clearness
in &#8220;Das Neue Weib,&#8221; by M.
<span class="nowrap">Janitschek.<a id="FNanchor801"></a><a href="#Footnote801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></span></p>

<p>The contrast to the woman who wishes to become a personality
is to be found in the woman who has never possessed a personality,
or who has lost it, the woman who has become only a
chattel, an object of enjoyment for man&mdash;<b>the prostitute</b>. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page748">[748]</span>
alluded before (<a href="#Page315">p. 315</a>) to the fact that Margarete B&ouml;hme, in her
sensational &#8220;Diary of a Lost Woman,&#8221; was not the first to
describe the life of a prostitute. Already from the sixteenth
century there date such romances as, for example, the celebrated
&#8220;Lozana Andaluza&#8221; of Francisco Delgado; also Defoe&#8217;s &#8220;History
of Moll Flanders,&#8221; and Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost&#8217;s &#8220;Manon Lescaut&#8221;
(both belonging to the eighteenth century). Besides the
&#8220;Memoirs of a Hamburg Prostitute&#8221; (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page315">p. 315</a>), there
exist still other precursors, belonging to the nineteenth century,
of the &#8220;Diary of a Lost Woman,&#8221; such as E. de Goncourt&#8217;s
&#8220;Fille Elisa,&#8221; Leon Leipsiger&#8217;s &#8220;Ballhaus-Anna,&#8221; etc. The
&#8220;Diary of a Lost Woman&#8221; naturally soon found imitations, such
as Hedwig Hard&#8217;s &#8220;Confessions of a Fallen Woman,&#8221; the &#8220;Diary
of Another Lost Woman&#8221;; and the purely pornographic &#8220;History
of Josephine Mutzenbecher, a Viennese Prostitute,&#8221; Daudet&#8217;s
&#8220;Sapho,&#8221; Zola&#8217;s &#8220;Nana,&#8221; Cristian Krogh&#8217;s &#8220;Albertine,&#8221; and
George Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Esther Waters,&#8221; belong to the same
<span class="nowrap">class.<a id="FNanchor802"></a><a href="#Footnote802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Brothel life</b> and the <b>life of prostitution</b>, in all their relationships
to modern civilization, and in their influence upon human character,
are described by Frank Wedekind in &#8220;Die B&uuml;chse der
Pandora&#8221; (&#8220;Pandora&#8217;s Box&#8221;) and in his &#8220;Hidalla&#8221;; and with
exceptional vividness by Oscar Metenier, in his romance cycle,
extending to seven volumes, &#8220;Tartufes et Satyres.&#8221;</p>

<p>The r&ocirc;le of <b>alcohol</b> and of <b>syphilis</b> in the sexual life have also
been discussed in belletristic literature. In Gerhart Hauptmann&#8217;s
&#8220;Vor Sonnenaufgang&#8221; (&#8220;Before Sunrise&#8221;), Loth
abandons his beloved Helne as soon as he learns that she springs
from a degenerate family of drunkards. The disastrous consequences
of syphilis are described by Ibsen in &#8220;Ghosts,&#8221; and
recently most vividly by Brieux in &#8220;Les
<span class="nowrap">Avari&eacute;s.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor803"></a><a href="#Footnote803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></span></p>

<p>Extraordinarily comprehensive, especially in France, is the
belletristic literature of <b>sexual perversities</b>. After the manner of
the &#8220;Rougon-Macquart&#8221; series by Zola, Jean Larocque has
written a romance cycle of eleven volumes, under the general
title of &#8220;Les Voluptueuses&#8221; (the separate titles are: &#8220;Isey,&#8221;
&#8220;Viviane,&#8221; &#8220;Odile,&#8221; &#8220;Fausta,&#8221; &#8220;Daphne,&#8221; &#8220;Ph&#339;be,&#8221;
&#8220;Fusette,&#8221; &#8220;La Na&iuml;ade,&#8221; &#8220;Louvette,&#8221; &#8220;Lucine,&#8221; and
&#8220;H&eacute;mine&#8221;; in the last volume we find even a discussion of
copralagnistic details!). Some volumes of this series&mdash;for
example, &#8220;Ph&#339;be&#8221;&mdash;have even been translated into English.<span class="pagenum" id="Page749">[749]</span>
The works also of Baudelaire, Verlaine, and Guy de Maupassant,
offer a rich material for the study of psychopathia sexualis. In
this connexion I may also mention the poetic collections &#8220;La
L&eacute;gende des Sexes,&#8221; by Edmond Haraucourt; &#8220;Rimes de Joie,&#8221;
by Th&eacute;odore Hannon; and also the &#8220;Chants de Maldoror.&#8221;
Octave Mirbeau also, in his &#8220;Journal d&#8217;une Femme de Chambre,&#8221;
provides us with a review of the entire register of sexual
<span class="nowrap">perversities.<a id="FNanchor804"></a><a href="#Footnote804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></span>
He, and also the talented Rachilde (who in her
romances &#8220;Monsieur Venus,&#8221; &#8220;Les Hors Nature,&#8221; and &#8220;Madame
Adonis,&#8221; considers the question of homosexuality), never fail to
exhibit the artistic spirit in their descriptions of these delicate
topics&mdash;and, indeed, <i>l&#8217;art pour l&#8217;art</i> doctrine seems to have been
created especially in relation to this department of thought.</p>

<p><b>Homosexuality</b> and <b>bisexuality</b> have been considered in such a
large number of works that it is quite impossible to mention
them all here. A fairly complete bibliography of these will be
found in the volumes of the <i>Annual for Sexual Intermediate</i>
<span class="nowrap"><i>Stages</i>.<a id="FNanchor805"></a><a href="#Footnote805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></span>
I can allude here only to a few especially well-known
and artistically important homosexual romances and poems.
Jouy, in his admirable &#8220;Galerie des Femmes&#8221; (Paris, 1799),
devotes to the &#8220;Lesbiennes&#8221; a special chapter; Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier, in &#8220;Mademoiselle de Maupin,&#8221; discusses the interesting
problem of bisexuality; Zola, in &#8220;Nana,&#8221; represents the Lesbian
relationship; Paul Verlaine in 1867 published tribadistic poetry
under the title of &#8220;Les
<span class="nowrap">Amis.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor806"></a><a href="#Footnote806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></span>
Since that time Englishmen,
Germans, Belgians, and Italians have published belletristic
descriptions of homosexual relationships. I may allude to Oscar
Wilde&#8217;s &#8220;Dorian Grey,&#8221; Georges Eekhoud&#8217;s &#8220;Escal-Vigor,&#8221;
Walt Whitman&#8217;s &#8220;Leaves of Grass,&#8221; Prime-Stevenson&#8217;s &#8220;Iren&aelig;us,&#8221;
Louis d&#8217;Herdy&#8217;s &#8220;L&#8217;Homme-Sirene,&#8221; F. G. Pernauhm&#8217;s
&#8220;Ercole Tomei,&#8221; &#8220;Die Infamen,&#8221; and &#8220;Der junge Kurt&#8221;; also
the sensational &#8220;Idylle Sapphique&#8221; of the demi-mondaine Liane
de Pougy, the epic &#8220;Ganymedes&#8221; of C. W. Geissler, and the
drama &#8220;Jasminbl&uuml;te&#8221; of Dilsner.</p>

<p>Masochism found its introduction to belles-lettres by the writer
from whom the very name is derived, L. von Sacher-Masoch,
more especially in &#8220;Verm&auml;chtnis Kains.&#8221; Of his novels, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page750">[750]</span>
best known is &#8220;Venus im Pelz&#8221;; others are &#8220;Galizischen Geschichten,&#8221;
&#8220;Messalinen Wiens,&#8221; &#8220;Die schwarze Zarin,&#8221; and
&#8220;Wiener Hofgeschichten.&#8221; He still remains the only writer
who has treated this peculiar perversity in an artistic manner.
The more recent masochistic and sadistic novels belong to the
worst kind of hawker&#8217;s literature. Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute; only,
in &#8220;Eine Ausschweifung,&#8221; has artistically described the spiritual
masochism of a woman with the fine psychological characterization
peculiar to her work.</p>

<p>Quite recently there has actually appeared a masochistic
monthly magazine, entitled <i>Geissel und Rute: Archiv f&uuml;r
Erziehung</i> [<i>sic!</i>] <i>Erwachsener</i> (<i>Whip and Rod: Archives for the
Education</i> [<i>sic!</i>] <i>of Adults</i>), edited by C. vom Stein, Buda-Pesth.
The first number appeared on February 1, 1907. It
contains masochistic stories, correspondence, historical sketches,
and advertisements.</p>

<p>Sadistic love is the theme of Oscar Wilde&#8217;s &#8220;Salome,&#8221; and of
the &#8220;Diaboliques&#8221; of Barbey d&#8217;Aurevilly. The satanic element
is dealt with in Huysmans&#8217; &#8220;La Bas,&#8221; and in various novels by
St. Przybyszewski. Herbert Eulenburg&#8217;s drama &#8220;Ritter Blaubart&#8221;
also represents a sadistic type.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may allude to some authors who represent to
us the whole psychology of modern love, and, above all, the
depths of the love of reflection, its spiritual refinement, all the
manifold moods, illusions, and dreams of the modern eros.
J. P. Jakobsen&#8217;s &#8220;Niels Lyhne,&#8221; Hans J&auml;ger&#8217;s &#8220;Christiania-Boh&ecirc;me,&#8221;
Oskar Mysing&#8217;s &#8220;Grosse Leidenschaft,&#8221; Heinrich
Mann&#8217;s &#8220;Jagd nach Liebe,&#8221; Gabriele d&#8217;Annunzio&#8217;s &#8220;Il Piacere,&#8221;
&#8220;Trionfo della Morte,&#8221; and &#8220;Fuoco,&#8221; represent aspects of love.
With the profoundest art, Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute;, in her stories&mdash;which
in this respect I regard as among the most valuable products
of modern literature&mdash;&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; &#8220;Fenitschka,&#8221; &#8220;Ma,&#8221; and
&#8220;Menschenkinder,&#8221; represents the finer spiritual relationships
between man and woman. This writer appears to possess the
most intimate knowledge of the soul of the modern woman.
Elisabeth Dauthendey, also (&#8220;Vom neuen Weibe und seiner
Liebe&#8221;), Gabriele Reuter (&#8220;Liselotte von Reckling,&#8221; &#8220;Ellen von
der Weiden&#8221;), and Rosa Mayreder (&#8220;Idole&#8221;), give most powerful
descriptions of complicated feminine
<span class="nowrap">characters.<a id="FNanchor807"></a><a href="#Footnote807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></span> An important
and interesting topic is discussed by Yvette Guilbert in &#8220;Les
Demivieilles&#8221;&mdash;the psychology of the woman beginning to grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page751">[751]</span>
old, who cannot yet renounce love and yet is forced to do so by
rude reality.</p>

<p>The writings to which I have referred in this chapter&mdash;the
number of which could easily be increased tenfold without
exhausting the abundance of recent belletristic literature occupied
in the discussion of the sexual problem&mdash;should suffice to give
some idea of how great is the interest in the important problems
of the sexual life, how detailed and complicated the problems of
that life have become under the influence of modern civilization,
and with what earnestness they are treated in the belles-lettres
of the day. The light and frivolous mood of Wieland
and Clauren is no longer found to-day. In its place we have
grandiose moral description, a more <b>dramatic</b> treatment of
sexual problems, an unsparing exposure of the gloomier aspects
of amatory life, and a psychological penetration into all the
activities of the loving soul. Regarded <b>as a whole</b>, love in
modern belletristic literature is treated from far worthier and
higher standpoints than formerly. <b>There is no ground whatever
for regarding the widespread discussion of sexual problems in
modern literature as a stigma of degeneration.</b> In this respect
our literature is merely a mirror of our time; and its tendencies
indicate very clearly the emergence of a new, earnest,
and more profound conception of the sexual relations between
man and woman.</p>

character to Vera&#8217;s book&mdash;viz., &#8220;The Heavenly Twins,&#8221; by Sarah Grand. But
the classical English example of a novel devoted to the consideration of the
differing standards by which preconjugal sexual intercourse is judged in man
and in woman respectively is &#8220;Tess of the D&#8217;Urbervilles,&#8221; by Thomas Hardy.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote798"></a><a href="#FNanchor798"><span class="label">[798]</span></a>
In &#8220;The Woman who Did,&#8221; by Grant Allen, we have an English novel
advocating free love; like &#8220;Eine f&uuml;r Viele,&#8221; this evoked a number of novels
with allied titles, such as &#8220;The Woman who Didn&#8217;t,&#8221; &#8220;The Woman who
Wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; and the like. A far profounder study of a free union between a
man whose wife refused to divorce him (on &#8220;moral&#8221; grounds) and another
woman is George Meredith&#8217;s &#8220;One of Our Conquerors.&#8221; In &#8220;Jude the Obscure,&#8221;
by Thomas Hardy, we have another detailed consideration of the difficulties
attendant on a free union in a society under the dominion of Philistine morality.
A recent novel in which freer sexual relationships are discussed from a somewhat
ideal standpoint is &#8220;In the Days of the Comet,&#8221; by H. G. Wells. (In the
character of Sue Bridehead, in &#8220;Jude the Obscure,&#8221; we have a remarkable
study of the &#8220;frigid&#8221; type of woman. I have before alluded, in a <a href="#Footnote436">note</a> to
<a href="#Page435">p. 435</a>, to a recent novel by Hubert Wales, &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Villiers,&#8221; devoted

&#8220;Bourgeois morality is the arch-murderer, which murders your youth and
the youth of many of your sisters. If we lived in natural conditions, you would
always, from the days of your childhood, be surrounded by young persons of
the other sex. One of these would have contracted a friendship for you; another
would have honoured you from a distance; with a third you would have played
joyfully. But from your twentieth year onwards, three or four or more of them
would have ardently wooed you, because you are strong and beautiful and
chaste. And so with tears, and passion, and suffering, with games and kisses,
you would have gladly become a woman; thus it is even yet among the children
of manual labourers. A beautiful, chaste, diligent workman&#8217;s child has wooers
enough. But among the so-called cultured people, morality has distorted and
destroyed all the beauty of nature.... Where the middle-class youth goes
to and fro, there goes also, like an old youth-hating aunt, morality, and destroys
for each poor girl the best time of her life; and many never come to marriage,
and many come too late.&#8221;</p>

An early example of the &#8220;emancipated woman&#8221; in English literature is
to be found in Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#8217;s &#8220;Aurora Leigh.&#8221; This conception
of feminine character aroused the usual hostility in minds working along the
older grooves, so that Edward Fitzgerald, when Mrs. Browning died, is said to
have exclaimed: &#8220;Thank God! No more &#8216;Aurora Leighs&#8217;!&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII</h3>

<p class="noindent">Truth is always a good thing, even truth regarding the sexual
life. Neither prudery nor moral hypocrisy can controvert this
proposition. He who recognizes the immense importance of
sexuality in relationship to civilization at large&mdash;he who, like
the author of the present work, has been occupied for many years
in the study of the subject from the points of view of medicine,
anthropology, ethnology, literature, and the history of civilization&mdash;is
not only entitled, but will also consider it his duty, to publish
his investigations, to make publicly known his views and his
opinions, and to take a definite and clear position in relation to
the burning questions of the day in this province of thought.</p>

<p>Such men as Ploss-Bartels, who, in their celebrated and
purely scientific work, &#8220;Woman in Natural History and Folklore,&#8221;
could not avoid collecting numerous piquant and even
obscene details, and who, for example, have described in a special
chapter the various postures assumed during sexual intercourse;
such a man as von Krafft-Ebing, whose &#8220;Psychopathia
<span class="nowrap">Sexualis&#8221;<a id="FNanchor808"></a><a href="#Footnote808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></span>
contains a number of detailed autobiographies and clinical
histories of sexually perverse individuals&mdash;such men as these
have been blamed because their books have been diffused in
numerous editions, extending to many thousands of copies, and
because these books have been read more by laymen than by
medical men. Apart from the fact that in earlier times much
more dangerous books&mdash;such, for example, as the works of
Virey, Flittner, G. F. Most, and Rozier, characterized by a
lascivious style, or such a book as the dictionary &#8220;Eros&#8221;&mdash;obtained
the widest possible circulation; apart, also from the
fact that even in works conceived and executed in a strictly
scientific spirit&mdash;such as the numerous monographs of Martin
Schurig, or the work of Frenzel (belonging to the nineteenth
century) concerning impotence (see, for example, Frenzel, <i>op.
cit.</i>, pp. 155, 156, 161)&mdash;obscene passages and incredibly depraved
stories occur; and apart, finally, from the incredible mass of
pornographic writings, in comparison with which the scientific
literature of the sexual life is almost infinitesimally small&mdash;putting
on one side all these considerations, it is merely necessary
to refer to the <b>established fact</b> that all possible sexual perversities<span class="pagenum" id="Page756">[756]</span>
were known to exist before the publication of von Krafft-Ebing&#8217;s
&#8220;Psychopathia Sexualis,&#8221; and that they made their appearance
spontaneously at all times and in all places. In the eighteenth
century the Marquis de Sade, in his romance &#8220;The One Hundred
and Twenty Days of Sodom,&#8221; was able to found a system of
psychopathia sexualis which not only contained <b>all</b> the perverse
types described by von Krafft-Ebing, but was even more varied in
its contents, and exhibited yet more numerous categories of
sexual anomalies than the book of the Viennese
<span class="nowrap">alienist.<a id="FNanchor809"></a><a href="#Footnote809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></span> This
work is a document of enormous importance to
<span class="nowrap">civilization,<a id="FNanchor810"></a><a href="#Footnote810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></span>
because it provides a complete refutation to the fable of modern
degeneration, and because it gives us a proof that <b>quite shortly</b>
before the powerful upheaval of the French nation and the heroic
campaigns of the Napoleonic epoch, in this nation there were
diffused the most frightful perversities, regarding the reality of
which there can, according to recent experience, be no doubt
whatever.</p>

<p>Scientific authorship&mdash;even popular scientific
<span class="nowrap">works<a id="FNanchor811"></a><a href="#Footnote811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></span>&mdash;dealing
with the province of the sexual life cannot therefore be made
responsible, in any respect, for the diffusion of sexual perversities.
The founder of modern sexual science, A. von
<span class="nowrap">Schrenck-Notzing,<a id="FNanchor812"></a><a href="#Footnote812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></span>
insisted on this fact; and recently it has been once more emphasized
by S. Freud, who has probably gone further than any other
writer in biologico-physiological derivation of sexual perversions.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis&#8217;s &#8220;Analysis of the Sexual Impulse&#8221; (vol. iii.
of this writer&#8217;s &#8220;Studies in the Psychology of Sex,&#8221; published<span class="pagenum" id="Page757">[757]</span>
by the F. A. Davis Co., Philadelphia)&mdash;a book in which we
find an admirable analysis of the development and variations of
the sexual impulse, including an account of sadism and masochism,
enriched by numerous examples&mdash;has recently appeared
in a German translation (W&uuml;rzburg, 1903). The translator,
Dr. H. Kurella, in his preface to this work, says (pp. ix, x), in
my opinion with perfect justice:</p>

<div class="textquote">

<p>&#8220;Daily experience among my patients suffering from nervous
diseases&mdash;patients who were for the most part women and girls&mdash;has
shown me how extremely important is enlightenment regarding the
sexual life for women suffering from nervous disorders. <b>For this
reason, I hope the book will have the widest possible circulation among
the mothers of daughters about to grow up.</b> If they will employ in
a proper manner the knowledge which they will be able to obtain from
its contents, in this way an immeasurable quantity of sorrow and
misery can be prevented. This use of its teaching will, by itself,
suffice to compensate the author and the translator for the scruples
they must always feel in giving to the world a book which is likely
to be valued by some simply as providing prurient reading matter, and
which by such persons will perhaps be circulated for this purpose&mdash;a
fate to which every book dealing with erotic subjects is exposed,
however earnest its style and tendency may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lively scientific activity which now animates the department
of sexual problems is a matter for rejoicing, since
it indicates the advance of knowledge in one of the most
important of all vital problems. Whereas earlier none but
alienists and neurologists concerned themselves with sexual
questions, an interest in these questions is now very generally
displayed by the circles of other medical men, of anthropologists,
folk-lorists, psychologists, &aelig;sthetics, and historians of civilization.
One good result of this wide diffusion of interest is, as I
have already remarked (<a href="#Page455">pp. 455</a> <i>et seq.</i>), that a one-sided consideration
of the problems under investigation will thereby be
prevented. Every earnest investigator, to whatever discipline
he may personally belong, can here contribute something <b>new</b>,
something which will advance knowledge; but most helpful,
unquestionably, can the <b>physician</b> be who, as von
<span class="nowrap">Schrenck-Notzing<a id="FNanchor813"></a><a href="#Footnote813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></span>
declared, is competent to consider the question in
relation to various other departments&mdash;those of biology, anthropology,
history, belles-lettres, psychology, and forensic medicine.</p>

<p>It would subserve no useful purpose to enumerate once more
in this place the works of all the recent authors who have dealt<span class="pagenum" id="Page758">[758]</span>
with the subject of the sexual life. In the text of the present
book they have for the most part received sufficient
<span class="nowrap">mention.<a id="FNanchor814"></a><a href="#Footnote814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></span></p>

<p>Of larger monographs upon homosexuality, there still remain
to be mentioned those of Havelock Ellis and J. A.
<span class="nowrap">Symonds,<a id="FNanchor815"></a><a href="#Footnote815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></span>
A. <span class="nowrap">Moll,<a id="FNanchor816"></a><a href="#Footnote816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></span>
J. <span class="nowrap">Chevalier,<a id="FNanchor817"></a><a href="#Footnote817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></span>
and <span class="nowrap">Laupts.<a id="FNanchor818"></a><a href="#Footnote818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></span> In these works we find
extensive reports of cases; and more especially in the two first
mentioned do we find a record of all the historical and critical
data of homosexuality up to the time of the first publication of
the &#8220;Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages&#8221; (1899 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>A new work by Havelock <span class="nowrap">Ellis<a id="FNanchor819"></a><a href="#Footnote819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></span>
recently reached me, the
fifth volume of the American edition of his &#8220;Studies in the
Psychology of <span class="nowrap">Sex,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor820"></a><a href="#Footnote820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></span>
giving an account of &#8220;Erotic Symbolism&#8221;
(fetichism, exhibitionism, etc.), the &#8220;Mechanism of
Detumescence,&#8221; and the &#8220;Psychical Condition during Pregnancy,&#8221;
with an appendix giving an analysis of the sexual development
of various individuals. This book, full of interesting
details, will doubtless, like the earlier volumes of his &#8220;Studies,&#8221;
soon appear in a German translation.</p>

<p>The fundamental work of A. Marro on &#8220;Puberty in Man and
Woman&#8221; also deserves especial mention. It can most usefully
be consulted in the French edition, &#8220;La Pubert&eacute; chez l&#8217;Homme et
chez la Femme. Etudi&eacute;e dans ses Rapports avec l&#8217;Anthropologie, la
Psychiatrie, la Pedagogie, et la Sociologie&#8221; (Paris, 1902; 536 pp.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page759">[759]</span></p>

<p>Special studies on the subject of the sexual impulse have been
published by <span class="nowrap">Moll<a id="FNanchor821"></a><a href="#Footnote821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></span>
and <span class="nowrap">F&eacute;r&eacute;.<a id="FNanchor822"></a><a href="#Footnote822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></span>
In Moll&#8217;s work, of which hitherto
the first part only has appeared, the sexual impulse is divided
into two components, the &#8220;detumescence impulse&#8221;&mdash;that is,
the impulse towards the evacuation of the reproductive products&mdash;and
the &#8220;contrectation impulse&#8221;&mdash;that is, the impulse
towards the other individual; and from these two components
the various manifestations of sexuality are explained. F&eacute;r&eacute;, more
especially, has made an exhaustive study of the instinctive element
of the sexual impulse; and, apart from this, he appears to be the
most extreme advocate of the atavistic theory of sexual perversions.</p>

<p>An interesting study of sexual psychology, based upon the
doctrine of Freud, has been published by Otto
<span class="nowrap">Rank.<a id="FNanchor823"></a><a href="#Footnote823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></span> The tendency
of this work also is in opposition to the degeneration-phobia.</p>

<p>The work of the Italian psychiatrist Pasquale Penta, &#8220;I pervertimenti
sessuali nell&#8217; uomo e Vincenzo Verzeni strangolatore
di donne&#8221; (&#8220;The Sexual Perversions observed in Vincenzo
Verzeni, the Strangler of Women&#8221;), Naples, 1893, contains
numerous interesting details. In the first chapter the author
gives contributions to a history of psychopathia sexualis; the
second chapter contains a detailed report of Verzeni and an
account of his lust-murders; in the third chapter Penta discusses
the similarities and differences between the sexual impulse in
man and in the lower animals; in the fourth chapter he deals
with the biological foundations of lust-murder; in the fifth
chapter he reviews the different sexual perversions; in the
sixth chapter he considers rape; and in the seventh and last
chapter he discusses the forensic importance of rape and of sexual
perversions.</p>

<p>The recently published work on &#8220;Sexual Biology,&#8221; by Robert
M&uuml;ller (Berlin, 1907), is written from the standpoint of veterinary
medicine, and the sub-title of the book, &#8220;Comparative and
Evolutionary Studies in the Sexual Life of Man and the Higher
Mammals,&#8221; indicates the author&#8217;s intention to elucidate the
general biological roots of sexual phenomena. This <b>comparative</b>
consideration of the sexual life of man and of the higher mammals
throws a new light on many matters, and enables us to understand
a number of phenomena of the sexual life which have
hitherto seemed obscure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page760">[760]</span></p>

<p>A comprehensive, general, popular work upon the sexual life
is now in course of publication&mdash;&#8220;Man and Woman.&#8221; It is
issued by R. Kossmann and J. Weiss, with the collaboration of
a number of leading specialists (Stuttgart, 1907). A number
of illustrated sections have already been issued.</p>

<p>Finally, two other works must be mentioned which consider
the sexual life as a whole, a larger work and a smaller one.
<span class="nowrap">Forel&#8217;s<a id="FNanchor824"></a><a href="#Footnote824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></span>
comprehensive book is distinguished from beginning to
end by an <b>original, subjective</b> grasp of the question, and by
an <b>optimistic view of the future</b>, as I have pointed out in
my review of this book in the <i>Deutsche Aerztezeitung</i>. As such
a subjective programme of a future solution of sexual problems,
it will ever retain a value; and we can always follow with pleasure
the demonstrations of the talented and sympathetic author,
although the book is perhaps somewhat monotonous in character.
Its merits, moreover, are counterbalanced by the almost complete
neglect of the numerous recent researches in almost every
department of the sexual life. More particularly the chapter
upon syphilis and venereal diseases, the chapter upon homosexuality
and sexual perversions, and the chapter upon marriage
betray this fault. The chapter on marriage is a mere extract
from Westermarck. The author is fully conscious of these
defects, and freely admits them; and in spite of them the book
must not be ignored, because its value really lies in its subjectivity,
and because we find in it so profound a conviction of
the great importance of <b>social</b> activity for the higher development
of love. A shorter consideration of sexual problems, but
one abounding in paradoxes, is to be found in a book by Leo
<span class="nowrap">Berg.<a id="FNanchor825"></a><a href="#Footnote825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion, I may give a brief survey of the reviews and
other periodical publications which are occupied with sexual
questions. A great periodical devoted to the <b>entire province</b> of
sexual research does not exist. Such periodicals as we have
deal with separate departments of the sexual life. A rather
insignificant periodical, <i>Vita Sexualis</i>, which appeared for the
first time in 1899, seems to have become extinct a few years
later. An exceedingly valuable publication, especially occupied
with the problems of homosexuality, bisexuality, and sexual
intermediate stages, is the one edited by Magnus Hirschfeld,
and entitled <i>Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages</i> (of this eight
volumes have hitherto appeared). Purely popular and belletristic
aims are subserved by the homosexual monthly magazine<span class="pagenum" id="Page761">[761]</span>
<i>Der Eigene</i> (edited by Adolf Brand). Another annual, not less
valuable than the one previously mentioned, is that edited by
Friedrich S. Krauss, entitled <i>Anthropophyteia</i>. This treats more
especially of folk-lorist research in sexual matters, and is a true
treasure-house of new facts and
<span class="nowrap">observations.<a id="FNanchor826"></a><a href="#Footnote826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></span> The periodicals
for the study of venereal diseases, such as the <i>Archives of Dermatology
and Syphilis</i>, edited by F. J. Pick (hitherto eighty-two
volumes), the <i>Monthly Magazine of Practical Dermatology</i>, edited
by Unna and Tanzer (hitherto forty-four volumes), the <i>Monthly
Magazine for Diseases of the Urinary Organs and Sexual Hygiene</i>,
edited by W. Hammer, in succession to K. Ries (hitherto four
volumes), and the other German and foreign dermato-urological
periodicals, also contain much material regarding venereal diseases
and sexual perversions. Interesting contributions to all sexual
problems, as well as an extensive case-literature and bibliography,
are to be found in the <i>Archives for Criminal Anthropology and
Criminology</i>, edited by Hans Gross (hitherto twenty-seven
volumes), proceeding largely from the pen of the learned and
most original alienist Paul N&auml;cke; also in the <i>Monthly Magazine
for Criminal Psychology and Criminal Law Reform</i>, edited by
Gustav Aschaffenburg; in the monthly magazine <i>The Protection
of Motherhood; a Magazine for the Reform of Sexual Ethics</i>, edited
by Helene St&ouml;cker (<i>vide supra</i>, pp. 270 and 273); in the monthly
magazine <i>Sex and Society</i>, edited by Karl Vanselow (hitherto
two volumes); and in the illustrated magazine, under the same
editorship, <i>Beauty</i> (hitherto four volumes). Finally, we have to
mention certain periodicals concerned chiefly with the aims of
racial hygiene, and containing valuable material&mdash;the <i>Politico-Anthropological
Review</i>, edited by Ludwig Woltmann (hitherto
five years of issue), and the <i>Archives for Racial and Social Biology</i>,
edited by Alfred Ploetz (hitherto three years of issue).</p>

Recently A. Moll (<i>Enzyklop&auml;dische Jahrb&uuml;cher der gesamten Heilkunde</i>,
1906, vol. xiii., pp. 238, 239) has expressed the &#8220;opinion,&#8221; <b>without offering the
slightest proof in support of his views</b>, that &#8220;The One Hundred and Twenty
Days of Sodom&#8221; is a forgery. But I myself, in my French edition of this work,
have given all the historical and critical details regarding its origin; moreover,
the original manuscript, as has been shown by the examination of all the experts,
(1) <b>dates from the eighteenth century</b>; (2) <b>is throughout in de Sade&#8217;s original
handwriting</b>; (3) <b>is written in his characteristic style</b>; and, finally, the forgery
of this manuscript, a roll 12 metres 12 centimetres in length, written on both
sides in letters of microscopic smallness, would be an absolute impossibility. If
anything is genuine and authentic, this work is such. Dr. Albert Eulenburg, without
doubt one of the most experienced, if not the most experienced, student of de
Sade, assured me that this work unquestionably came from de Sade&#8217;s pen. I
must, therefore, reject Moll&#8217;s opinion, which was formed independently of any
proof, and without any examination of the original manuscript, as <b>unscientific

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>

<p class="noindent">Looking backwards over the long road which lies behind us, and
which has conducted us past all the heights and deeps of the
human amatory and sexual life, we may now endeavour to give
a brief answer to the difficult question, What is the <b>future</b> of
human love? Are we able to recognize the existence of progress
towards better things? Are there any indications of a new,
nobler, happier configuration of the sexual life? The answer
is a confident and joyful &#8220;<b>Yes!</b>&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Never</b> before throughout the history of mankind has love
evoked so earnest and so profound an interest as to-day; never
has it been considered from so eminently <b>social</b> a standpoint as
now. As I remarked at the first public meeting of the Association
for the Protection of Motherhood, the idea of a reform,
ennoblement, and more natural configuration of the sexual life
harmonizes perfectly with the general tendency of our time,
which has in view a resanation of all the relationships of life.
It is continually more clearly and widely recognized that in the
human sexual life, as in all other departments of human activity,
modifications may be effected by means of <b>conscious</b> endeavour
in the direction of a progressive evolution; that the relationship
between man and woman, alike in its individual and in its social
aspects, is influenced by the changes and advances of human
evolution; and that this relationship cannot be artificially confined
by main force within limits which may have been suitable
to it one hundred or two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Our love is of this earth, afflicted with all earthly defects and
sorrows. Notwithstanding this, we <b>affirm</b> it joyfully, in the
confident hope that it can be saved from all hostile and destructive
influences, and that it can be elevated above the transient
and the casual, and manifest itself in its finest form as <b>intimate,
individual</b> love. In the sphinx of the individual, the greatest
riddle of all unquestionably lies in the alarming and elemental
qualities of the sexual impulse. But the way to liberation is
obvious and open. Let us fight courageously with all the hostile
forces described in this book, which poison the amatory life of
our time; let us destroy all the germs of degeneration, and let
us imprint upon our sexual conscience three words&mdash;<b>health</b>,
<b>purity</b>, <b>responsibility</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page766">[766]</span></p>

<p>One thing more. Why does love at the present day so often
threaten to perish amid the general fragmentation of life?
Why do the leading spirits and the greatest artists in love complain
of the fragile character of all love? Because love is
isolated, because it is not associated with the <b>work of life</b>, with
the battle for <b>freedom</b> which every man has to fight; because
love is not conceived as a union between the lovers for the common
<b>conquest of existence</b>, as a partnership for the purposes of <b>inward
spiritual growth</b>. Far too often the man of the future is opposed
to the woman of the past, or the woman of the future to the
man of the past; each is to the other a <b>sexual</b> being, and nothing
beyond. And yet individual love is only possible when, passing
beyond the aims of mere sexual gratification, and beyond the
purposes of reproduction, it subserves the general objects of life,
and assists in the performance of all the tasks of the civilization
of our time. The most wonderful dreams of the heart cannot
suffice to take the place of the positive work which life demands
from love. <b>Without free activity there is no love!</b> That is the
great saying of a great thinker. And I add to this saying, that
without free activity there is no <b>right</b> to love. Such a right is
possessed only by the <b>personality</b>, the poetic, striving, willing
human being, be it man or be it woman. How often the man
seeks love from the woman and cannot find it, and yet might
have found it so easily!</p>

<p>In this beautiful verse of Ada Christen&#8217;s the secret of all love
reveals itself. We must not seek that which is lower in the
other sex, in the beloved person; we must seek the <b>highest</b>, her
spiritual essence, her will, her developmental possibilities.
Before the eyes of the modern human being, the individual love
of two free personalities appears as an ideal, as is poetically
expressed by Dingelstedt in the words:</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="smcap">Extract from Author&#8217;s Preface to the First German Edition.</span></p>

<p>This book is the fruit of long experience and reflection. It has two
fundamental ideas&mdash;the study of nature, and the study of the psychology
of man in health and in disease.</p>

<p>To harmonize the aspirations of human nature and the data of the
sociology of the different human races and the different epochs of
history, with the results of natural science and the laws of mental and
sexual evolution which these have revealed to us, is a task which has
become more and more necessary at the present day. It is our duty to
our descendants to contribute as far as is in our power to its accomplishment.
In recognition of the immense progress of education which we
owe to the sweat, the blood, and often to the martyrdom of our
predecessors, it behoves us to prepare for our children a life more
happy than ours.</p>

<p>Professor Forel is well known to English readers through the
medium of English translations of his other works on Psychiatry and
kindred subjects. The present work has already been translated into
several European languages. Whether we agree with all Professor
Forel&#8217;s conclusions or not, we must admit that he has dealt with a
difficult and delicate subject in a masterly and scientific manner.</p>

<p class="book">MARRIAGE AND DISEASE</p>

<p class="bookdata">Being an Abridged Edition of &#8220;Health and Disease in Relation to
Marriage and the Married State.&#8221; Edited by Prof. <span class="smcap">H. Senator</span>
and Dr. <span class="smcap">S. Kaminer</span>. Translated from the German by <span class="smcap">J. Dulberg</span>,
M.D., J.P. (of Manchester). Demy 8vo., 452 pages. Cloth, price

<p>A quarter of a century has elapsed since Francis Galton, in his
&#8220;Inquiries into Human Faculty,&#8221; drew attention to the urgent need
for the foundation of a science and practice of &#8220;Eugenics,&#8221; that is, the
improvement of the human stock. &#8220;Health and Disease in Relation
to Marriage and the Married State,&#8221; edited by Senator and Kaminer,
undoubtedly occupies a very high place among recent works devoted to
the elucidation of certain aspects of this important topic, and in the
abridged edition an adaptation has been prepared for the enlightenment
of the thinking portion of the public on pathological questions in relation
to marriage and the married state, and from which all purely technical
and professional matter has been excluded.</p>

<p>At a time when such questions as the decline of the birth-rate,
the sterilization of the degenerate, the restriction of indiscriminate
marriages, the voluntary limitation of families, and so forth, form
subjects of daily debate and newspaper articles, it is of the greatest
advantage that every man and woman who either contemplates or has
embarked on matrimony should be as well acquainted, as the limits of
our conventionality permit, with the medical or hygienic aspect of
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="PageA3">[A3]</span></p>

<p>To give some idea of the scope of this absorbingly interesting work,
we append the chapter headings. These apply to the unabridged as
well as to the abridged edition at present under review.</p>

<p class="fsize90">I. &mdash; Introduction. II. &mdash; The Hygiene of Marriage. III. &mdash; Congenital and Inherited
Diseases and Predispositions to Disease. IV. &mdash; Consanguinity and Marriage.
V. &mdash; Climate, Race, and Nationality in Relation to Marriage. VI. &mdash; Sexual Hygiene.
VII. &mdash; Menstruation, Pregnancy, Child-bed and Lactation. VIII. &mdash; Constitutional
(Metabolic) Diseases. IX. &mdash; Diseases of the Blood. X. &mdash; Diseases of the Vascular
System. XI. &mdash; Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. XII. &mdash; Diseases of the Organs
of Digestion. XIII. &mdash; Diseases of the Kidneys. XIV. &mdash; Gonorrh&#339;al Diseases.
XV. &mdash; (<i>a</i>) Syphilis. XVI. &mdash; (<i>b</i>) Diseases of the Skin. XVII. &mdash; Diseases of the Organs
of Locomotion. XVIII. &mdash; Diseases of the Eyes in Relation to Marriage, with special
regard to Heredity. XIX. &mdash; Diseases of the Lower Uro-Genital Organs and Physical
Impotence. XX. &mdash; Diseases of Women, including Sterility. XXI. &mdash; Diseases of the
Nervous System. XXII. &mdash; Insanity. XXIII. &mdash; Perverse Sexual Sensations and

<p>Brief as is this sketch of the abridged edition, it will suffice, in
conjunction with the following extracts from a few of the many highly
laudatory reviews, to show how valuable the work will be to parents
and guardians, family advisers, whether lawyers or clergymen, schoolmasters
and schoolmistresses, as well as to those who are already
married, and to those who are contemplating marriage.</p>

<p class="fsize90"><i>THE LANCET</i> says: &#8220;The progress of sociological investigation in modern
times has caused increased attention to be paid to questions of health in relation to
marriage and the propagation of the human race, and anything which helps to
spread abroad an intelligent appreciation of the dangers incurred, not only by
individuals who enter on the married state, but also by their offspring, from the
existence of many forms of disease must be regarded as a public benefit. The
present book is an attempt to make available for general consumption the gist of the
larger work from which it is taken.... The material contained in the book is most
valuable, and a study of it should be useful to those capable of appreciating it....&#8221;</p>

<p class="fsize90"><i>PUBLIC HEALTH</i> says: &#8220;It is cleanly, even when dealing with most difficult
subjects, and it is a storehouse of information on points on which hygienists are
expected to be well informed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fsize90"><i>THE SCOTTISH MEDICAL JOURNAL</i> says: &#8220;As a guide for the general
public many of the articles are well adapted to fulfil their object.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fsize90"><i>THE DAILY DISPATCH</i> says: &#8220;... every work that helps to enlightenment
is to be welcomed so long as it comes with credentials as to its honesty and guarantees
that it is not merely a device for making money out of ignorance. &#8216;Marriage and
Disease&#8217; has all the essential claims to consideration. Dr. Dulberg has very ably
condensed the larger manual into one of 450 pages, containing 27 chapters. The
volume is of absorbing interest, not only for its arguments and conclusions, but
also, and perhaps mainly, for the wealth of information it contains on matrimonial
and sex questions in all countries and climes.&#8221;</p>

<p class="bookad line1"><b>The Hygiene of the Lung.</b> By Prof. Dr. <span class="smcap">L.
von Schr&ouml;tter</span>, Director of the Third Medical Clinic in the University of Vienna.
Translated by <span class="smcap">H. W. Armit</span>, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. This little work is intended to lay
before the uninitiated reader (and also before the practitioner) the anatomical and physiological
characteristics of the organs of respiration, and the best methods of protecting
these organs. It deals with the more common ailments, and with the rational treatments
not only of the affected parts but also of the causal agents, thus combining an
elementary prophylaxis. In the most readable manner possible this little book tells a
useful story of the healthy and diseased lungs, <i>a story which the practitioner who reads
it will not despise, and which he will find of great value to give to his patient to
read</i>. Crown 8vo., 136 pp. With 16 Illustrations, cloth, price 2s. net.</p>
